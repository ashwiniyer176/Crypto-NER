51% attack,"A hypothetical situation where more than half of the computing power on a blockchain network is controlled by one person or group, thus allowing them to dictate which transactions are verified. This would allow them to prevent other users from completing confirmed transactions and cause havoc within the system, and double-spend coins.",
51% attack protection,"A protection mechanism implemented by several cryptocurrencies that require more than 50% of their total hashing power working together as one entity (which would make it difficult for attackers since they'd need even more resources and time) or if this threshold is below 100%, having an additional safeguard feature where at least 66% must agree with every transaction before sending, making them unable to double-spend anything without others noticing until these changes are made on the chain permanently.",
AFK,Away From Keyboard; used on social media platforms like Twitter where users share their trading activity but only want to receive messages while they're logged into their account (and not away doing other things).

Chaffing,"The practice of purposely sending false signals between nodes on a network using fake IP addresses so that they only see information that has already been seen by another node or set of nodes before, thus making consensus impossible for any new data being added onto the chain; this works against 51% attacks where attackers try to introduce invalid blocks into the chain since other miners will not recognise these blocks because they cannot make sense out of what they are seeing due to chaffing.",
Confirmation,"This is how many transactions have been processed/validated and added to its ledger so far since it began existing, either through mining or other means, including private ones off-chain. Confirmed transactions cannot be reversed without cooperation from others involved with keeping records on the network's shared ledger (see consensus).

Distribution,"The selling of coins, especially by whales who hold large amounts to stabilise prices and avoid crashing them.",
Distributed ledger,"A type of database that is spread out across several nodes in different locations and countries so that it can remain decentralised as well as transparent to those involved with keeping records on it; every single node will hold a complete copy which is updated regularly through consensus algorithms when new transactions take place. This also allows for faster processing speeds since multiple copies are already available rather than one central authority who has to distribute them from scratch if something does go wrong. It should not be confused with distributed computing, though both use similar techniques but ledgers record data while computations perform actions based on said data.

Halving,The process by which Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced by 50% every four years; this is done to create scarcity and control the total supply (since no more than 21 million Bitcoins can ever be mined).,
Hash function,"A specific algorithm that maps data of any size to a fixed size output, also referred as a cryptographic function since they are often used for encryption and other security purposes where it cannot be reversed through computation alone; hashing takes an inputted string/file/document and outputs the same thing every single time so long as its original content has not been altered even if just by one letter or space character. This process is irreversible, making working backwards to discover what was used next nearly impossible unless someone had access to the private key associated with each transaction on blockchain networks containing these hashes written into their blocks instead. Every cryptocurrency's hash algorithm must meet certain requirements before being approved into existence.",

These often occur when there is low volume, but many exchanges have daily limits for how much you can trade, so some traders will try to take advantage of these periods by making repeated trades throughout them.",
Scrypt,"An alternative proof-of-work algorithm designed by Colin Percival for Tarsnap online backup service in an effort to make it more difficult to perform large scale custom hardware attacks (which was possible with bitcoin because its SHA256 hash function could be run on commodity hardware). It's been adopted by many altcoins since then due to the increased cost involved when using ASICs rather than GPUs/CPUs, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.",

Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Burn (PoB),"PoB allows the miners to “burn” or destroy cryptocurrency which grants them the right to add blocks in proportion to the coins destroyed. Essentially, miners burn coins/tokens to buy virtual mining rigs that give them the power
                to mine blocks. The more currency burned by the miner, the bigger the ensuing virtual mining rig. To burn, miners send currency to a verifiably un-spendable address. This process does not consume many resources, thus PoB is often called
                PoW without energy waste. Depending upon the implementation, miners are allowed to burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, and in exchange, they receive a reward in the native currency of the blockchain.",

Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Stake (PoS),"In PoS, miners put up(i.e., ""stake"") some of the blockchain's cryptocurrency (e.g., ether for the Ethereum blockchain) in order to increase their chances of being selected to validate a block. The stake is locked up as a deposit to ensure
                the miner validates the block according to the rules. If the miner violates the rules, the deposit will be ""burned"" or destroyed. PoS is less resource intensive than PoW since fewer miners are racing to solve the mathematical formula.",
Consensus Mechanism - Proof of Work (PoW),"In PoW, transaction data (block) + a random strings of digits (nonce of block) are repeatedly applied to a (hashing) mathematical formula by miners, until a desirable outcome is found (the proof of work). Other miners then verify the proof
                of work by taking the alleged input string and applying it to the same formulae to see if the outcome is indeed that what was presented. If the results are the same, the transaction is verified and added to the blockchain. As many miners
                are racing to solve the formula which requires a great deal of computing power, PoW is resource intensive.",
