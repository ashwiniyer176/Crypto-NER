322232,nice,
322233,thanks sharing,
322234,thanks sharing really helps non dev people understand concept still understand efficient though,non 
322238,part efficiency saving storage space e g right eth transaction means storing full call params chain that's prove really sending tokens zk proofs theory store proof tokens transfered without ever need store transaction details,e g eth transaction tokens proof tokens transaction

322586,read entire conversation dumb take privacy sake privacy need justify tornado ,
322588,weth oasis protocol going fine weth seems bridged wormhole well ,protocol

322596,yeah way avoid privacy default,
322597, ,
322598,free money brave enough,money 
322599,practice privacy default always easy tornado counterparts make user friendly way protecting ,
322600,specific privacy default mean something like zcash transactions layer need private people choose privacy centralized entities going discriminate,zcash transactions 
322601,like imagine zcash rollup smart contracts,zcash 
322602,case rollup acting tumbler would interested another great innovation would private bridging ,
322603, ,
322604,one says required use cexs b c using tornado though,one 
322605,people also use bucc tornado,
322606,mean want offramp going touch regulated participant eventually,

322632,1 charity less donate going donate wormhole foundation ,
322633,yes native bridge used everyone bridging solana,
322634,actually worked pretty good specially stable coins chain swaps sollet using wormhole,chain 
322635,shit maybe used typically use anyswap ,
322636,anyswap existent mean first early bridge,
322637,ah ok thank,
322638,also think ftx using exchange swaps sure,exchange 
322639,shush voncent,
322640,fuck would come,

322646,nasty thing one affected approvals,
322647,basically anyone ever approved bnb bunch tokens vulnerable get accounts drained,tokens 
322648,best prefix multichain hack old news want freaking ,
322651,yea lol,
322652,think people freaking tbh,
322653,much money unsecured copy paste code platform,money 
322654,talking wormhole necessarily,
322655,thorchain got hacked ago,
322656,10 days old,
322659,jesus exactly revoke permissions,
322661,dev news highly recommended ,
322662,safe see anyswap multichain debank revoke permissions know i've used protocol another way manually ,protocol

322668,day happens day project dies incredibly quick death,
322669,say gave solana chance everytime used painful issues network overloaded whole better ux even high tps narrative solana utter bullshit better l1 certainly far worse many ,
322672,think problem entire eth scaling model everything needs bridged long term security issues like one ,eth term 
322680,site ,
322681,heard ftx footing bill,
322682,seem like hard make open secure bridge least secure kind hack,
322683, ,
322684,note solana part eth scaling model l1 trying relevant bridging assets ultimately homed eth,eth eth 
322685,derive security eth depends,eth 
322686,saying eth l2s experience similar pains least centralization risks taking ease one trilemma legs ,eth 
322687,note sc bug problem bridge model could happened bridge like anyswap ,
322688,yep although standard open bridge contract evm would usable evm based chain rewrite every time,contract chain time 
322689,anyswap os still ran bug,
322690,sure fixed bug contract right ,contract 
322691,future l2s use fixed contract hopefully make mistakes new ones ,contract 
322692,yes everyone uses anyswap anyways case solana use since rust,
322693,open source magic bullet means bugs fixed anything bad happens prevent bugs reoccurring use current best version anyone think contain collective knowledge people white black hatting time ,source time 
322695, ,
322696,huge,
322697, ,
322698, ,
322699,think cheap revoke every approve costs gas amount approving ,gas 
322700,guess whether want save couple dollars risk balance wiped,
322701,could always approve much spend think need instead infinite approvals,
322702,wow ur everywhere,
322703,seen u bao finance gmx,finance 
322704,sure thing tx amount gas approval,gas 
322705, ,
322706,building citadao io bring real world asset chain,io chain 
322707, youtuber feature us recently,
322708,wow incredible true,
322709,team knew exploit weeks ,
322710, anybody understand borrowing synth would increases capital efficiency lending protocol requiring asset lent present protocol ,protocol protocol 
322711,search method nice joke,
322712,protocol elswhere potential useful guess,protocol 
322713,wonder recourse work,work 
322714,really means liquidity different place concentrated amm synth target ,liquidity 
322715,isomorphic,
322716,hey guys wanna check owner mutisig address check thanks ,address 
322718,wheth price dumped 1 1 solana blockchain,blockchain 
322719,think that's 2 different topics 1 bridge comparisons 2 stable coin multichain policies,coin 
322720,yes probably problem get solved 'practical 'terms example subways bridges connecting skyscrapers chains city metaphor chains may fail get delayed usefull time see alex near tweet ,time 
322721,yup 2 diff topics resource either that'd great tks ,
322722,normal lending protoool even liquidity i'm trying figure instead old boring stuff borrow eth directly ,liquidity eth 
322723,normal lending protocols liquidity,liquidity 
322724,protocol reserves dai compound aave lent,protocol 
322725,functionally compound could think borrowing cdai immediately trading dai compound protocol built cdai dai amm lenders actually forced split lent dai lending providing dai amm latter earning interest one reasons spread lending borrow rates compound,protocol 
322726,interesting know intermediate token compound leave two questions though token lend dai directly asteria different compound ,token 
322727,sorta speaking schematically dunno compound actually cdai step functionally,
322731,one reason separate intermediate token transforms problem determining optimal amount reserves hold designing amm synthetic target latter something may better,
322732,wonder eth originates since unclear diagram depending exactly works could eth eth 90 10 amm sounds dangerously close reserve banking tbh,eth eth 
322733,make sense thanks answers ,
322734,interesting mechanics,
322735,implicit compound amm basically cdai dai current redemption rate plus tiny fee iirc,
322736,constant sum curve,
322737,instead curve curvature may trading little target use set interest rate,
322738,rai works,
322739,dai matter,
322740,compound maker built constant sum amm,
322741, guess maker sorta latter psm ,
322742,psm constant sum tho right flat fee personally prefer stableswap functionality ,
322743,basically bonding curve would smth like green red bars fees rate differences borrowing x,
322744,reserve factor built interest accrued redemption rate point swapping cdai dai fee ,
322745,ya like stableswap concentrated liquidity price discovery nice,liquidity 
322746,thought hilariously small fee,
322747,hopefully share experience building router protocol group know issue builder proceed cautiously even think cool product huge latent demand continuously want get one audit one pen testing process done opening alpha letting loose likes samczsun tob etc platinum names booked foreseeable future big well funded projects large funds zero bandwidth look small guys like us think might slightly differentiated approach meantime investors community want product updates immediately like yesterday also matter audits current big vendor model completely flawed terms incentive alignment even largest names worked almost basically maximising billing real skin game critical bugs router discovered independent white hat hackers daos like immunifi also struggling talent service demand ,router protocol product product router 
322748, ,
322749, ,
322750,would give hacker edge mev race,
322752,exact q yes maybe hope nobody else looking messed bad code w proper testing give time edge others figure,time 
322753,would need farm fork,fork 
322754,real defi protocol,defi protocol 
322756,maybe could weird time hope nobody else necessary liquidity available short notice ,time liquidity 
322757,seems risky ,
322758,investigator definitely gonna suspect liquidator,
322759,cause familiar protocol liquidators already connected easy connect love mev cause u r even playing field,protocol 
322760,permissionless middleman,
322761,several liquidator bots use flashloans ,
322762,yeah need somewhere arb,
322763,saw recently sometimes fail surprising ways extreme circumstances,
322766,investigation concerns even matter hacker north korean state sponsored actor,state 
322767,agree totally audit companies maximizing billables often great job anyway tbh used audits gemz exact reason fill gap profit taken stuff auditors got sniped big boys ,
322768,work wish auditors generalize way ser,work 
322769,oh clear we'd independent free audits find exploits vulns already audited contracts report projects yes wanna call names generalized bad ser p indeed good,
322770,ah c thank u clarifying ser,
322771,remember major auditing company ever refunded project audited hacked examples ,
322772,neither ,
322773, eh hard say guess usually guarantee safety check best ability hence getting several probably best choice though today's rates that's possible many projects ,
322774,also farfetched insider could exploiting vulns they're fixed quick enough sure isnt high suspect list along inside job ,
322775,conspiracy theories lead absolutely nothing fruitless,
322776,correct yes try best logos much care security end day one predict see especially new experimental stuff,
322777,ya true absolutely crazy thought would never happen ,
322778,gain much insight audit team code open anyway ask questions discord dev team yes understand team security policy better huge edge anyway dumb conspiracy really pisses leads nothing proposes nothing dev teams rug actually ye whatever good day ffs,
322779,flashbots considered edge really gain edge ,
322780,true apparently vuln found audit conspiracy possibility ,
322781,mean one thing code open significance inflated otherwise another give someone idea issues information actually,
322782,wrong coine r something make discussion cause dead end,
322783,whats point proof information omitted auditor want discuss possibilities day directions ,proof 
322784,ye point indeed u right,
322785,case closed,
322787, fin ,
322788,well beg question timing github commit fix vuln soon checked exact timing yet minutes hours still soon exploit occurred interesting timing making conspiracy theory thinking timing possible timing coincidental attacker rushed executing due seeing commit certainly raises questions pointing fingers party exploit brought forward born witnessing commit openness could issue case ,
322789, openness could issue open security stuff vulnerabilities know issue actually fixing issue openness common sense idk details case though doubt real reason dull,
322795,security convos use ctrl f read banteg ideas immunefi guys ideas samczsun others fin ,
322797, ,
322803,closing thought ivangbi indulge maybe time audit daos spearbit teams come together continuously go bug bounties form loose decentralised governance,time governance 
322804,go bridging native network token fees without using exchange eg 1 eth eth network want bridge ftm network ftm ftm wallet side new ftm fees mostly using anyswap stable pools still need use exchange get native token fees yes thanks ,exchange eth eth wallet exchange 
322805,bridges add bit native token gas times faucets sometimes would buy ftm eth mainnet bridge first ,bit gas eth mainnet 
322806,perhaps buy ftm ethereum bridge idk treated native ftm fantom,ethereum 
322807,sometimes buy token cex withdraw blockchain buy ftm binance example ,blockchain 
322808,use elk finance bridge convert elk native token deduct amount bridge,finance 
322809,multichain org suport ftm avax asfaik times swap liquidity side stables work best gets stuck native side use exchange whole point ive bumped problem several times new networks wallets elk finance looks like solve supports different chains thanks ,liquidity exchange finance 
322810,support avax ftm,
322811,confirm though clear ui wftm thing fantom,
322812,meant example want go polygon avax there's option via usdc pool native tokens it'll get stuck point avax wallet new avax fees withdraw usdc pool end,tokens wallet 
322813,yeah one biggest issues people trying start fresh wallet chains without cex limited possibilities getting enough native token get started may able bridge 100k usdc use cant pay gas ,wallet token gas 
322814,done elk finance bridge elk token native swap,finance 
322815,yes much liqidity think combination elk fees multichain stable pools may work well great multichain includes form 'swap bridge' kind thing there's opportunity im sure im aware,
322818,bridge avax token matic token several chains example buy matic binance withdraw bsc bsc bridge directly polygon,
322819,multiple bridge airdrop gas token avax bnb matic pay first transaction nowadays synapse celer feature,airdrop gas token transaction 
322820, ,
322821,design aspect considered router estimate destination fee bake fee pay origination source could also meta transactions biconomy instance though yet many chains including bsc ,router source transactions 
322822,could also swap source chain whatever want destination chain,source chain chain

323043,attempts make self sustaining immutable governance algostable samkazemian pointed earlier people always prefer stablecoin higher collateral ratio however collateral supply side always looking capital efficiency collateral fully owned protocol pressure make capital efficient set safe collateral ratio like 400% issue new stablecoins safe threshold collateral come collect fees usage add fees collateral build would slow fees usage slow accumulate collateral however demand strong high collateral surprises human intervention transparent data critical price point collatetal ratio goes 100% peg always hold critical point might break peg external markets though time truly decentralized stablecoins would enter circulation obstacle protocol self sustainability price feed oracle imposes external point failure auctioning sales purchases stablecoin would internalize risks however come sufficiently good system avoid exploitation ,self governance stablecoin protocol data time protocol self oracle stablecoin system

323047,suggesting,
323048,ah gotcha gov stablecoin ,stablecoin 
323049,rai liquity,
323050,liquity needs people add collateral need check rai,
323051,eth collateral afaik,eth 
323052,issue governance minimized stablecoins price performance actual product protocol unless devised god mechanism somehow never break 99% market conditions actually perform well important thing stable price ,governance product protocol mechanism market 
323053,protocols agnostic price stability like eth amms like uniswap whatever much immutable completely devoid form human input months years without needing hard forks protocol upgrades product price stability entirely something else ,eth protocol product 
323054,would mechanism suggest break way would collateral price crashes hard issue every algostable transparency high collateral one needs panic also crash immediate people start exiting collateral ratio nears 100% pump collateral remaining circulating supply system relying arbitrage mechanisms close 100% collateral ratio making lack collateral narrative makes unclear breaking point invites bank run ,mechanism transparency system 
323055,hey banteg chance know q4 h2 financial report yearn published ,
323056,transparency governance high collateral ratio source price stability others dont ,transparency governance source 
323057,mechanism break 400% cr collateral located deployed 400% cr inside protocol controlled amm pairs token holders want deploy new collateral types want deploy 400% collateral smart contracts originally stored governance right ,mechanism protocol governance 
323058,hi notice staking contracts balance staked token sent back sender address different amount deposited example ,
323059,exactly can't change room governance failure less risk collateral bank contract stablecoins redeemed eth ,governance contract eth 
323060,well nice think protocol would serve narrow useful purpose stablecoin would able grow fast enough given capital inefficiency ability upgrade anything sounds like feature bug could become niche favorite groups want possible decentralized option sacrificing liquidity use cases ,protocol stablecoin liquidity 
323061,probably token value equal staked token value like share staking pool ,
323062,yeah extreme stability risk minimization slow grow without donations though expecting long term banks accumulating somewhere already suggestion might resilient price feed mechanism ,term mechanism 
323063,long term bank make profit ability sounds like overcollateralized amm basically sounds like fei without dao governance like fei right mix governance overcollateralization ,term dao governance governance 
323064,public good might even competitive edge price pay profits ,
323065,agree governance good profits think contradicts stability financial markets overextend risk taking since forever ,governance

323081,apparently unverified due ip fork prevention really sure feel tbh,fork 
323082, immutability lack human interaction feature bug immutability must somehow redefined ,immutability immutability 
323083,one way surely use change via governance much user dev friendly however never truly resilient due human factor unchangeable protocol may deployed needed trial error produces truly resilient protocols profitable easy public goods benefit everyone emphasized decentralized algorithmic stablecoin design highest stability achieved huge collateral ratio one wants tie much capital fees providing service stability enough compete opportunities however capital belongs protocol care opportunity cost solve incentive problem human backers would also governance definition less stable immutable contract great stablecoin needs predictable possible surprised people repeat mistakes tradfi first step ,governance protocol stablecoin protocol cost contract stablecoin 
323084,central banks used clear backing dollar gold wanted keep inflation dollar stable possible modified version taylor rule proposed make predictable possible every turn stable predetermined predictable rules turned argument discretion needed see pattern usefulness governance depends application comes monetary stability unchangeable rules simplicity transparency trump discretion ,dollar gold inflation dollar governance application transparency 
323085,probably bad example back point since retirement gold standard us economy actually grew lot getting rid strict rules turned benificial,gold standard 
323086,dont know counterfactual debatable also achieved long term stability unwinding show costs also suggesting system stability fed bunch mandates ,term system

324067,fees paid traders use mixture lp incentives trading rebates saying tokens would need distributed means fee rebate could use mixture two use governance balance guess thinking taker fee rebates would paid economic activity rather passive deployment capital may work cex would think issues maintaining proper pricing fee rebate type variable distrobution open attack vectors issuing tokens staking contract fixed rate ,trading tokens governance type attack tokens contract 
324068,well generally fees paid liquidity providers staked tokens dex reward parking tokens dex taker acts swap believed worthwhile additional incentive needed per se play toward idea say rebate offered would necessarily small would increase cost gas transaction manage rebate added cost might high higher swap smart contract even l2 cheap l1 rebate value would likely tiny cost exchanging rebate token likely worthwhile someone conducts many transactions low gas chain could possible rebate tokens aggregate value would still less anything liquidity providers receive swap fees probably going good model certainly sustainable one reasons,liquidity tokens reward tokens cost gas transaction cost contract cost transactions gas chain tokens liquidity

324755,interesting,
324756,yes,
324758,enough space collectively grow infinity cost math check also soon another solution appears storage chain basically entering spiral death kind like malls opening next another mall offering free rent tenants move old mall dies lack use thing happens new one one etc ,cost chain 
324759,arweave's light paper 2018 maintained regards youtube scale web3 priorities different web2 counterparts applies web3 whole ser lack education wrt nft media assets reliant 3rd party pay storage unfortunately problem protocol hacks caused front ends compromised ipfs speciality matching file hash content different mutually compatible technologies costs cents store 10mb permanently btw ,protocol ipfs file hash 
324761,anything done ,
324762,interesting analogy apply protocols either since incentives,
324763,pays proto,
324764,metaplex uses arweave storage services nft hot thing right might correlation services right taking nft away arweave that's crypto specific would lose even uses since ipfs literally use non crypto purposes low cost easy use compared arweave,ipfs non crypto cost

324773,nft storage average joe pays zero person launching nft generally want money wager majority project parties gone paying storage 10 years education problem imo sure comparing ease use arweave storage option built metaplex websites let drag drop files free ar faucets simple crypto products still requires browser extension downloaded ,nft person nft money crypto 
324774,necessarily least completely imo protocol versatile enough uses pivot specialize depends community storage chains one usp hurr durr cheap storage forever lie unlike free transactions forever see aurora clowns ,protocol transactions

326200,github links certainly helps thanks lot ,
326201,delta 0 1 1 week expiry right ,
326202,problem emerging crypto option markets statistically stable imo better asses risks parametrs history words 2017 one backtest strategy long eth would show perfect results local crash words always find local highs lows backtest charts otherwise would flat line right question numbers statistically significant say use moving window revaluate results guess would careful imo like driving car looking back mirrow,crypto eth 
326203,yep,
326204,say high possible sell mean premium satisfy apy target strategy pretty much increase decrease strike total premium falls target,
326205,nope strike 30 35% spot,
326206,yes one carefull predicting future based past performance definitely adds strategy understanding,
326207,premium auction starts minimum,

328331,risk nft recipients expectation gonna good actors solidly general ecosystem,nft 
328332,issue way rule bad behaviour subjective antagonistic voting opportunity cost vote high terms emissions community miss bribes fees also mad theory single actor ideally need coordinate others sudden looks like dao right,cost 
328333,non dilutive aspect nft incentives extract value cash grab teams high,non nft cash 
328335,anything mitigate missing smth ,
328336,community vote emissions,

328398,considering they're pretty much fantom native gets i'm kinda suprised andre come swinging folks like bytemasons reason fantom opera grown much bebis one first devs met started working space andre also fantastic dev chain owes relevance they're fighting shame reasonably speaking bytemasons middle launch devs know absolute burnout exhaustion comes sounds like bothered deal solidly week set way kick road next vote token would live i'm suprised many immediately jumping malice hanlon's razer dictates dumb joke land right complicated fact think many teams using solidly right fully understand implications actions well andre said andre middle launch morons twitter blaming rpc issues control suprise man hair trigger kept farming token nobody could buy would indicate malice seems like case frayed nerves exhasuted devs people jumping conclusions rest solidly holders could vote punish that'd zero sum game emissions make much sense unlikley happen ,chain

328400,sleepy dev strikes,

328423,created next fundraise idea someone decentralized foundation dao,
328424,think see andres upset every protocol received nft decided get together farm tokens access results state ones getting solid entire goal endeavor tvl snapshot rendered pointless goal distribute solid projects token holders projects vote emissions onto one project votes non trading token get solid nft entitles since lps increases voting power letting direct solid back may even elements prisoner dilemma sure considered mechanism thoroughly potentially makes possible drain value away solidly since bringing fees value protocol taking value system solid tokens ,protocol nft tokens state mechanism protocol system tokens 
328425,anything done ,
328428,general situation flaw mechanism design nothing hope element prisoner dilemma bm kinda special case since dao daos impacted since governed holders want solid tokens also wanting liquidity demand token specific case wait see happens solid tokens farm right malicious bm probably distribute community lp incentives lock however would mean something altogether different solid tokens locked non dilutive means first round emissions always voting power subsequent ones lock rather distribute solid tokens make indicative unethical behavior andre ascribed ,mechanism dao tokens liquidity tokens tokens non tokens

328554,emissions voted proportional circulating supply iirc fees go lps lps staked get solid instead groups use nft vote pool get fees,nft 
328557,token cannot traded hold one initial nfts keep voting token get 100% solid nft's voting power worth rather incentivizing people provide lps pool instead able parasitize solid dump market think that's going possible definitely flaw design ,nft dump market 
328558,think hope biggest protocols within community would also act best interests community large rather,

328643,yes that's trust devs much get ripped cylical problem question i'm wondering builders responsibility something bad actors nothing else self interest peace mind ,trust self 
328644,often comes reading builder says trying frontrun opportunities ppl can't distinguish dev innovating someone copy pasting projects care finding alpha others,
328645,surprised many cashgrabs scams market market knowingly funds like surprised unlikely survive bullet head,market market 
328646,whos surprised ,

328648,absolutely control mindset toxic people communities pushing fud contagious combatting team moderators really something needs encouraged user level users happy help shut often empowered knowledge lot cases much transparency could projects well community team mods may best communication skills time user can't help know answers either team discuss decisions made provide etc makes difficult anyone else step shut ,transparency time 
328649,problems 1 assume actually block people internet 2 assume people persuaded rational arguments angry 3 even successful 99% people 1% enough ruin builders day community big enough ,
328650,saying combat toxic behavior never solve problem like trying achieve world peace ,
328651,rational trying convince making sure everyone else see irrational ,

328666,giving attention cockroaches better ignore devs they're prominent power can't ignore one goes dark path loser screaming death threats mother's basement worth spotlight ban discussing archetypes ,

329192,stupid reasons,
329193,also looks really really bad,
329194,like nft given people farming airdrops offered war torn country sound like list want,nft 
329195,give attention give fake money,money

329200,idk though general still fully grasp idea sending ukraine goverment money people yes goverment continuously gets hundred millions handle begs mill apparently money help citizens want end political discussion general understand goverment airdrop ,money money airdrop 
329201,disagreeing donation efficiency goal maybe best way incentivizing ,
329202,think many general would agree that's nft drop even one can't find concrete proof going well could something that's getting lost translation help approach donations gamified manner ,proof 
329203,absolutely hate idea gamifed morality virtue would rather lose everything cheese themed scam tokens,tokens 
329204,iffy there's charity gives little nft badge donating cause like cleaning rivers taking care puppies think there's nothing wrong giving people sense pride accomplishments noted difference government thing especially one that's massively backed major powers ,nft government 
329205,implies value things extrinsically reality can't churches learned early hide wealth reason,
329206,yes totally agree badge good ponzu entry token bad began conversation thinking token airdrop rather nft,entry airdrop

329228,bought dip ,
329229,programatic,
329230,redemptions dec w obvious slope,
329231, canonical default signer purpose cannot expect send tokens send tokens connecting chain interacting alternatively use talisman subwallet ,tokens tokens chain 
329232,wait parity signer signer damn thought full non custodial wallet ,wallet 
329233,parity signer largely unmaintained alternative cold wallet separate device stylo ,wallet 
329234,mobile wallets mathwallet nova polkawallet fearless generally fully fledged metamask like apps web3 browsers built polkadot side web3 recommend nova,
329235, ,
329236,question signers common code wise minimal safer initiating transactions website seem intuitive lot easier build decent ux tokens automatically added without causing security risk ,transactions tokens 
329237,people lazy used metamask paradigm trying rather terrible signer absolutely correct approach ,
329238,yeah feels like large part mm ux bad tried things,
329239,phantom seems slightly better auto adding tokens seems dangerous,tokens 
329240,website separation concerns could way better job,
329241,especially heavily multi chain environment mm nightmare use even 2 3 active mock eths like matic ava fantom cannot use two apps two chains time without lazy devs deferring everything mm mm going crazy switch network nao warnings ,chain time 
329242,website provide rpc connection editable user functionality expects user interact nothing ask extension signatures ,
329243,yeah agreed thing site would query networks easy enough summarize everything offer consolidated view,
329244, catches lot flak minimal keeps users ridiculously safe ,
329245,seem struck fine balance minimal yet still shit ux pretty impressive actually ,
329246,expecting extension wallet everything sending tokens showing nfts dumb expecting dunno oasis app let send dentacoin context matters specificity matters ,wallet tokens 
329247,true mainly polkadot space js api ui extension everything bus factor 1 ,api 
329248,major security downsides website initiated transactions people get used click sign everything issues ,transactions 
329249,websites delegating signature metamask like wallet thing signer interpret message show signing need ,signature wallet 
329250,yeah thoughts seems like one figured might good reason,
329251,api every chain node dotsama standardized exposed via built metadata autogeneration theory every message submitted node 100% human readable signer ui risk really ,chain node node 
329252,website would also enable address book transaction history decent etc,address transaction 
329253,kitchen sink mode extension signer signer use something like singular app trade mint nfts limit feature set care cross chain balance assets crowdloan statuses raeadable sub id site etc work wish ethspace understood rather peppering switch network laziness every new tab open,chain work open 
329254,like unix like philosophy composable singular function components instead monolith jack trades master none ,function

329638,want wallet attempt make transactions without kind checks sufficient balance gas fee correct end burning eth transactions fail moaning instead,wallet transactions gas eth transactions 
329639,metamask knows kind porn u like,
329640,fml,
329641,every stage process leaks info,
329642,isp knows,
329643,infura knows,
329644,metamask knows,
329645,whats even worse,
329646,metamask's publishing account get compromised malicous version metamask make chrome's extenstion store update automatically downloaded every chrome user updated,
329647,seamlessly,
329648,automatically chromes default behavior,
329649,gm,
329650,oof,
329651,wen self buildable extension source,self source 
329652,hey guys dont worry eth sign getting depreciated safe use users lel,
329653,check ita twitter account storm ppl tweeting accounts social media manager trying control mess,twitter 
329654,think they're frontrunning users way flashboys iex ,
329655,process fully automated would assume instantly published e g big extensions upload update sort delay review ,e g 
329656,review looks good next relevant ,
329657,yeah nothing new use peoples infrastructure know stuff ,
329658,yes i'm aware bunch privacy issues mm also querying jpgs pretty annoying ux usually long way go proper privacy nation states entered arena better catch quickly though ,
329659,another quick question solidly staked solid thought would reward snapshot share change idea ,
329660, ,
329661,better checkmate zuk family,
329662,finally honest take,
329663,bro,
329664,yes,
329665,worries sir chrome extensions using manifest v2 obsolete january 2024,
329666,oh shit mean 2023,
329668, ,
329669,ruggggggggged,
329670,looks like sifu,
329671,clear metamask requires v2 cause handle priv keys think using agoric ses aka realms,
329673, ,
329674,considering rekts serious adblocker ubo brave end users,
329675,thanks sharing send cookies use local rpc still send analytics via means txs current block checking comm ,block 
329676,order books soon ,order 
329677, ,
329678,1inch already order book p2p like step toward fiat ramp imo,p2p fiat 
329679, beastlyorion retweeted metamask blocked ethereum transactions venezuela citing compliance laws ,ethereum transactions 
329680,little known problem also happening extent countries hneed switch mobile networks connect web3 websites sea there's issue europe ,
329681,kinda interesting api key'ing data siphoning means block even vpn,api data block 
329682,think anything metamask though probably depends rpc used website,
329683,maybe block regions ,
329685,ok say happens ok specific web3 apps atm cambodia ,
329686,happen self compiled metamask instances ,self 
329687,well assume geospoofing solve antidetect system eg ls tenebris cc good proxies 911 idk continue using ,system 
329688,see even time zone browser check pixelscan net f vision,time 
329689,let's see long going take extend russia etc,
329690,using metamask i'd surprised userbase even dented 0 01%,
329691, ,
329692,good tweet summary os new wallet vpn mm custom network rpc glad default infura thing crazy spy job mm tracking ip addresses somehow ,wallet addresses 
329693,closer thought geographically vietnam ,
329694,wen metamask fork default rpc decentralized infura already exists token sustain network ,fork 
329695,affected means they've paired real ip address consensys bothered need vpn,address 
329696,fair imagine consensys 1 minimum required law 2 enough headaches switzerland situation,
329697,russia using vpns living expect affected,
329698, solution get everyone away infura know much details saw ethdenver,
329699,start censoring become relevant enough pressured,
329700,decentralized rpc provider yes would think,
329701,connecting one centralized provider network nodes recall correctly,
329702,also run node proxy mode think would bulletproof solution,
329703,really understand people run nodes,
329704,incredibly simple much effort,
329705,easy cheap run something need submit txs interact network need archive queries etc centralized anyway centralized layers like graph etc ,
329706,easier install metamask,
329707,still effort using someone elses node people unless situation forces thats things work ,node 
329708,literally downloading image onto small computer plugging 12w even solar panel least selling pre synced ,
329709,yes point strong deterrent pretty sure people countries less voice say northern countries,
329710,lost 99% people image ,
329711, install picture run transactions insert math meme ,transactions 
329712,sure like said selling pre synced services still 500 really much pay 100% availability world uncensorable database ,
329713,average person yes ,person 
329714,literally plug play via stuff like avado whatever things called took stuff whitelabeled,
329715,yes,
329716,refuse believe world avg eth tx 100 use eth 500 lifetime access ,eth eth 
329717,disconnected average crypto user mean us running node ,crypto node 
329718,quite disconnected also wondering yes ,
329719,might interested look play around fun requirements good link get started ,
329720,they're willing pay make money they're willing make effort ,money 
329721, ,
329722,wouldnt even paid,
329723,avg user give shiz decentralization wan make,decentralization 
329724,avg user also technical,
329725,even willing make effort kinda like onchain voting visibly worth,
329726,took avg user fully figure metamask,
329727,well dunno maybe wrong camp livelihood depends metamask infura centralized eth infra much actually hurts finally fuck spending week learn basics list backuo rpc nodes text file mean seems like pretty good investment ,eth spending file 
329728,easy clicking download waiting 5 minutes pressing icon nothing else yeah probably changes,
329729,sure react need metamask good enuff,
329730,sync b c nah,
329731,leave tool migrating rn sweeposaurus com,
329732,hi anybody know metamask alternative ,
329733,frame,
329734,apparently talked already,
329735, several great alternatives mentioned also check linked defiprime list op post ,
329736,private run node would one txs depending host make identifiable ,node 
329737,thank,
329738,run nodes proxy,
329739,think stuff configurable within chosen client,
329740,mostly adds moving parts maintain upgrade time civilian use probably overkilled error prone,time 
329741, also,
329742,kinda like companies run servers anymore,
329743,running nodes multiple chains fault tolerant way big extra work,work 
329744,good option market rpc providers,market 
329745,think choice important thing,
329746,nobody hosts stuff anymore culture people things definitely disappeared years,
329747,true look said,
329748,pokt least incentivizes people run nodes otherwise hard get people rpc providers generally plug play,
329749,yeah multiple providers relaively low risk different legal spaces,
329750,infura bad,
329751, alchemy even walkthrough using lieu infura,
329752,us derisking compliance,
329753,long metamask bundled might hard get people move,
329754, ahem api key identifies ways similar infura,
329755,example another provider making infura ramp guide,
329756,better decentralization people running nodes best non us entities make easy switch may also make dent,decentralization 
329757,options best place hide tree forest,tree 
329759,wen ur first mention techcrunch smh,
329760,lmfaooo,
329761,win ,
329763,tbt 0xchad,
329764,sorry child charlie eth call us daddy,eth 
329765,thing multisig instead needing majority participants sign execute 24 hours allows member veto execution instead signed ,
329766,ah yes optimistic governance whatever called vshvsh u implemented someone else forgot,governance 
329767,seen lot people complaining tiresome getting participants sign lot time feels like makes sense,time 
329768,ivangbi,
329769,know 1 2 projects work advanced governance policies social recovery think much needed simple multisig functional daos access execution rights granular prod afaik though,governance 
329770,exactly thinking process joke like calling cleaner executive health maintaince officer,
329771,new name tag u blz,
329772,one suggest tool service try using combination gnosis special services like safient io find better solution please reply message sir 3,io

329774,link main defi chat group ,defi 
329775,troll ouch ser main one ,
329776,yep implementation made lido called easy track tailored dao aragon currently aware module use something similar like gnosis safe would awesome ,
329777,brutal customer review,customer 
329779,proud,
329781,gnosis safe tx guards could utilized tbh seen action personally ,
329782, ,

329791,fuckers make sure dump every bnb farm,
329792,free crypto world collapsing sad ,crypto 
329793,list crypto platforms avoid since started geofencing users regularly update list metamask infura opensea pancakeswap,crypto 
329794,tbf could come something like block front end legal policy alternative front end made community members that's fucking,block 
329795, cuba sudan democratic republic congo zimbabwe belarus syria iraq crimea belarus i'm going guess one mentions belarus meant russia edit article writer include north korea iran poorly written article screenshot lists countries ,
329798,banned name russia guess,
329799,avoid metamask sister ,
329800,good question,
329801,liquity really good example there's many different front ends makes censorship resistant ,
329802,guess avoid infura that's still main wallet kinda retarded main wallet since 2016 lol,wallet wallet 
329803,see use search helpful,
329804,still offers bad user experience,
329805,yes job project team educate community,
329806,front end solutions important,
329807, ,
329808,show single tweet even warned users,
329809,thanks read use 10 different wallets still need dig deeper figure one best main alternative mm get rpc part,
329810,yup warning world see ,
329817,admin ban,
329818,maybe use brave privacy browser chromium ethereum wallet included add custom rpc i've using pokt network rpc week gone yet ,ethereum wallet 
329819,brave tracks model advertising,
329820,disable,
329821,dont like idea wallet embedded within browser,wallet 
329822,coinbase wallet nice browser extension qr code scan ur phone,
329823,use coinbase exchange,exchange 
329824,whenever u want sign tx u scan ur phone opposed computer,
329827,yeah drawback looking get away mm kill 2 birds one stone config ,
329828,that's actually pretty nice i've avoided coinbase i'm distrustful trust decent mobile browser shit piloting imtoken browser far good ,trust 
329829,throw 1inch dydx ,
329832,heard devs hard times implementing software coinbase wallet,wallet 
329836,entirely reworked sdk walletlink coinbase sdk last week,
329837,easier work,work

329841,anyone duna analytics block usdc addresse volume calced usdt 350m ethereum alone excluding sidechains 5% usdt seized ,block usdc usdt ethereum usdt 
329842,omg geo blocking let avoid bit weird narrative past defi year geo blocking making sign disclaimer w ur wallet thing long time gradually projects open source uis could even circumvent run force ip blocking letting soft consent random disclaimers also openly say hey go use illegal frontend obviously bit brains research fundamentally different lower level infura rest holds ,bit defi year wallet time source force 
329843,virtue signalling best ,
329844,ser think bad diminishing importance problem would real trouble millions people right alone close hundred requests acquaintances buy stablecoin russia keep securely imagine many technically uneducated newcomers joining stablecoin marketing right people last week even know word solution think important split wallets two categories one gives easy way around avoid geo blocking one matemask browser plugin mobile app simple settings edit rpc addresses easy put new one trust wallet hand ,stablecoin addresses trust wallet 
329845,flashbots rpc good ,
329846,things supposed ,
329847,dont know set give try,
329848, ,
329849,sure seems fair meant context defi complex solutions expect users brains context really retail ye likely us friendly stuff also made opportunity anyway disagreeing per se ,defi 
329850,blankwallet provide solution dig privacy i'd like believe covers edge cases ,
329851, ,
329852, past issue ,
329854,stuck tx fix one kinda inconvenient aside api sushirelay com v1 suggested non censored rpc regular users ,api 
329855,question really people flock 'decentralized' solution like looks never quite understood fascination os anyway everyone able circumvent using nft agregators genie gem ,nft 
329856,looks decentralized way though airdropped tokens make decentralized especially hold big share tokens ,tokens tokens 
329857,jurisdiction sense team anon legal entity behind coerce,
329859,default powerful primitive ser opensea people get introduced nfts,
329860,sryyyyy addmin,
329861,didnt read definition way,
329862,ethermine org,
329863,sushirelay connects however flashbots endpoint ur tx night get rejected,
329864,what's best dex agg mev protected trades charges fees tokens eth ,eth 
329865,sushirelay also services frontend sushiswap exposes necessary rpc methods dapp function,dapp function 
329866,gasless trading ,trading 
329867,yes already using cowswap need alternative,
329868,setup ,
329870,matcha offers certain pairs,
329871,certain amounts forget,
329872,sushi router upgrade feature deployed yet,router 
329873,couldnt use flashbot rpc matcha 1inch paraswap ,
329874,gasless,
329875,also cowswap exactly asking bids,
329876,blocked usdt isnt sanctions malware hacks,usdt 
329877,true matcha use weth 5k gassless pairs ,
329878,hmm there's good alternative cowswap atm,
329879,vouch 500 wallets think matter time would based nationality political bs imho money controll goverments sort decentralized universal thing like water big influenced individual goverments ,time money 
329880,yes,
329881,ofac list banned addresses 21 eth addresses,addresses eth addresses 
329882,fincen yet request blocking usdt think sure,usdt 
329885,usdt banned addeess,usdt 
329886,oh right sorry since usdt banned sanction list yet means would never happen risk whatsoever apology short sighted claim banned based political reasons yet wrote 350m assets seized matter seconds current trend even wallets dex etc restricted access based regulator requests matter time centralized stablecoins follow ,usdt trend time 
329887,built ,
329891,thanks really appreaciate 24m ethereum thoughts 12x lower usdt ,ethereum usdt 
329892,idea sure methods banning used topic blacklisted called usdc blacklister calls 25 addresses eth ,addresses 
329894,use fwiw,
329895,major issues hanging txs anything that's worried,
329896, anyone know want know actual implementation,
329898,probably defi exploiters early days cashed usdt team fast freezing really interested suggest research much frozen usdt frozen hackers ,usdt usdt 
329899,evmos airdrop evm compatible chain cosmos already claimable looks like issues though frontend claim 50% evmos drop voting government proposal staking tokens 1 go community frontend feel free double check official evmos discord 2 connect metamask 3 navigate governance airdrop claim mission vote 4 go back main dashboard received 25% airdrop 5 need stake get another 25% airdrop 6 running validator preferred validator i'd happy could stake us danku zone w daic staked 25% dashboard available,airdrop chain government proposal tokens governance airdrop airdrop stake airdrop us 
329900,understand point limited geofencing due securities issue censuring smart contract pairs securities front end happening wide implications greatly affects ordinary users example opensea centralized platform prepared like blocked iranian russian artists buyers one day block chinese indian govt says hints like blocking whole countries may go individuals well blocking seizing talking war may situations like divorce investigation ppl unaware proximity tainted coins etc crypto world split two soon hope wake developers blue chip projects start thinking best practices comes front ends decentralizing governance code updates asap ethereum community decide impose infra default platforms work improving decentralized infrastructure seems prepared development different parts web3 puzzle going hand hand ,contract block developers governance ethereum work 
329901,totally true open source uis open source everything make users learn start experiencing issues natural indeed always private side industry fully public compliant one ,source source 
329902,stats usdc usdt bans ,usdt 
329903,applicable metamask since keplr fails vote right ,
329904,think keplr part need send receive ibc transaction get 25% airdrop f e switching osmosis keplr create new ibc transfer channel 204 osmosis token send 0 0x osmo evmos unlock 25% airdrop keplr,transaction airdrop e channel airdrop 
329905,official claiming page still broken ,

329912,project called trading strategy aims something similar live late 2022 probably ,trading 
329913,basically yearn active strats,
329914,anyone else still using ambire wallet imo best stable yield right around 24 25% hold lobster drawback get paid token,wallet 
329915,worked thanks cannot find ibc transfer button go keplr settings switch,
329916,wow lol waste tons claiming,
329917,would building strategies work gearbox exploring use cases team top tradfi quants profitable strats,
329918,done differently could maybe suggest concrete one ,
329919,cool eth denver talk guessing similar auth3's metamirror product chain data stored computed parcel privacy preserving blockchain storage computation infrastructure developed oasis labs ,eth product chain data blockchain 
329920,sure example 1 basis trade 2 long basket hedged exposures possible ,
329921,kind like dhedge dhegde subscribe existing fund managers get see manage positions transparently,fund 
329922,yeah dhedge still supporting perp,

329929, ,
329930,interesting,
329931,perp related strategies also possible via gearbox basis trading someone mentioned ,trading 
329932,mean whitelisting perpetual protocol instance strats smth else yes technically possible requires oracle work,protocol oracle work 
329933,yet integrations go brr soon maybe within couple months ,
329934,oh thanks u know perps dydx wont possible far know,
329935,probably impossible ye hard tech wise oxmikko correct wrong,
329936,keplr work ledger instance ,work ledger 
329937,im like read explained opinion im avoiding attitude chosen simply inform users even tweet geoblocking educate community way project team anonymously create front end position ,
329938,perpetual protocol work tongnk yes ,protocol work 
329939,interesting subject call anon duplicates geo fenced front ends know legit phishing fronts maybe start brainstorming need duplicate fronts asap ,
329940,core trusted members audit release os version compare changes anyone makes wanna run locally hash ok ui cross check source code ,hash source 
329941, oxmikko ur idea forget,
329942,going full monty ,
329943,exactly opinon project team come solution believe something called decentralized ,
329944,stand,
329945,would possible transfer collateral optimism ,
329946,would anon manner maybe giving hint core community least spread know ,
329947,yea composable ,
329948,info ser alpha,
329949,could intro team pls ,
329950, public resources,
329951,basically vault contracts somewhat similar gearbox credit accounts run oracles,
329952,ser make gearbox ,
329953,interdasting,

329967,started jupyter toolkit algotrading basically,
329968,wish knew means haha,
329969, think using vaults,
329970,geofencing usually done frontend layer simply cloning frontend code expecting able connect backend servers services upon deployment unlikely work perhaps solution could found server configurations route connections predefined array proxies based non geofenced territories,work

330734,i'm opposed coming distribution pairings uers future,distribution 
330735,engineering bandwidth work right,
330736,peter get frustrated fact data sips 003 proposed volumefi validated makes impossible justify continuing airdrop funds would go back community pool means used future ecosystem developments growth protocol zaki already mentioned opposed airdrop early sommelier pairings users currently manpower focus let us launch first cellars push staking rewards live revisit ,data airdrop protocol 
330737, opposed airdrop early sommelier pairings users currently manpower focus ,
330738, tldr let later,
330739,see negativity screaming ,
330740,time help verify data lot people sommelier chat somehow miss point noone saying early users get rewarded someone find fair way verify early user otherwise rewards get diluted people used uniswap eligible sommelier criteria think that's something community constructive help instead purposely misunderstanding whole discussion,time data 
330741,right i'm trying figure osmosis incentives land mine hit,
330742,eth airdrop conditions would rug osmosis lps,eth airdrop 
330743,would also lot arb volume across gravity bridge hurt cellar launch,
330744,sure tldr let postpone indefinitely,
330745,two sides 1 subjective dev team realized changes needed made 2 people users expected airdrop liquidity happened 1 data verified used excuse 2 devs decided traction timing etc need change 3 votes happened reflect point 2 question ye cia said come question whether company give damn voting decisions ,airdrop liquidity data 
330746,fair tldr vardhanam,
330747,implicit doxing,
330748,neither confirm deny ,
330749,also months months radio silence community suddenly message telegram chat stating decided go ahead proposal announcements discussion governance forum biggest issue ,proposal governance 
330751,promises endorsements timeline hype happening prior yes understand issue sometimes happening dev teams ae overly excited dev milestones always change important hard keep community expectations drive engagement order see somewhat paraswap airdrop issue trying say ,order airdrop 
330752,solution would every team hired full time dev who's discussing forum tg devs get burned agree communication would probably helped fully understand zaki's concerns can't proceed airdrop deep enough sommelier understand milestones get neglected time proceed sip 003 first ,time time 
330753,people retarded summarizes discussion everyone,
330755,def lot text read pls tldr ppl think soft governance hard governance dev said nah maybe later ,governance governance 
330756,well people retarded 1% brains comms allow 1% wave potentially become contributors need comfort total idiots comforting anyone leaves sad place,

332287,launching protocol token distribuition via nft distribuition public sale nfts 14th need register,protocol token nft 
332288,keep seeing unlock thing twitter nfts sure anymore,twitter 
332289,makes sense,
332293,hi wondering someone could help typical testing tools frameworks blockchain developers use ,developers 
332294,check sir eth security tools existing defi dev roadmap ,defi 
332295,hey fam interesting proposal certora bring continuous formal verification aave care aave integrated protocols future safety take look ,proposal 
332296,interesting certora proposes formal verification given v3 already formally verified v2 also v3 yet correct ,
332297,they're proposing continuous formal verification different process,
332298,correct,
332299,thanks river0x give implicit fixed messaging v3 half proposal continuous process place,proposal 
332300,details,
332301, ,
332303,looks like vote going well yay formal verification great test many protocols possible consider getting formally verified expensive also valuable ,
332304,yep missing 5k votes pass deadline tomorrow 10 30 utc ,utc 
332305,size aave even question problem always participation,
332306,curious works user deposits funds dydx deposit contract chain clob exchange get notified said deposit polling x amount time user clicks deposit see users account deposit contract balance broader scope blockchain stuffs communicate non blockchain stuffs sort inverse oracle problem,contract chain exchange time contract non oracle 
332307,aave might consider looking maker's delegate system worked seem equivalent maker's delegates active things considered roughly 10% mkr tokens delegated maker done lot work area though aave can't pull one hat overnight ,system tokens work 
332308,events ,
332310,maker votes 10 address participating yes delegates good system terribly flawed,address system 
332311,according keikaku,
332313,oh wow yes see lol certainly work done governance,work governance 
332314,makes sense chain clob trust implicitly would trigger check chain ,chain trust chain 
332315,yo fellas could someone pinpoint direction mining oriented tg group i'm talking industrial scale dd want ask questions thanks ,mining 
332316,know defi trusted group,defi 
332317,contract unless gets exploited way rewrites events think there's much worry,contract 
332319,yes sir trying understand works see hwo achieve something comprable soylana soylana rust event emit,event 
332320,never used solana ,
332321,weird system logs emit events per se pull rpc read,system 
332322,thanks seeing discord much soyyy,
332323,open issue ,
332324,solana plan using zkrollups nah,
332325,honestly make sense solana rollups,
332327,mean marketing reasons make sense otherwise,
332328,sidechain validator set save hassle around fault proofs zk circuits ,sidechain fault 
332329,way really making trust assumptions validator set pretty small aiui,trust 
332331,external call made,
332332,anyone insight yesterday's polygon issues trying find independent explanation problem solution can't find anything far,
332333,exactly solved yet afaict,
332334,yeah one questions find news articles yesterday polygonscan shows blocks already showing also see lot recent tweets claiming yet confused,
332335,pos chain that's due hotfix,pos chain 
332336,matic tendermint chain er responsible checkpointing mainnet staking stuff required bridge work idk still halted,chain mainnet work 
332337,got still serious,
332338,would basically require validators process double throughput might well increase block size original chain 2x leads set challenges ,block chain 
332339,difference guarantee states fully independent think solana already tricks around parallel access,
332340,would want ,
332341,mean arguemnt want l2s solana saying probably get similar scaling get l2s much less complexity given restricted validator set anyways ,
332342,give hassles l2s care bridging back forth without advantages ,
332343,state independence l1 chain l2 desirable feature composability breaks necessary one ,state chain 
332344,achieve level scaling increasing block size network take better option around ,block 
332345,yes think agree ,
332346,use l1 need l2,
332347,function time eth years state built l1s yet understanding eventually encounter similar problems,function time eth state 
332348,solana's marketing need ,
332349,mean eventually,
332350,l1s utilized full capacity blockspace contended still need l2s,capacity 
332351,easy add supercomputers kick road,
332352,say function currently insufficient technology,function technology 
332353,time bsc even 2 state bloat crumbles load,time state 
332354,actually great case study ethereum able model growth real world consequences would increased adoption demand,ethereum 
332355,bsc clone kind new technology,technology 
332356,think there's rudimentary support bsc erigon it'd nice real world stress test erigon,
332357,polygon network back temporary fix eight hour stoppage ,
332358,excited,
332359,need talk zk staff ,
332365,hi guys maybe know metric exchange devs sent 30k usdt contract mistake,exchange usdt contract 
332366,want recover,
332367,can't find contact message,

332409,going enforce whale cap attempting avoid sybil really take far imo monitoring chain post drop look consolidation accounts pretty dumb tech place enforce prior drop,whale chain 
332410,one unsuccessful gamer kun even got article commending efforts ,
332411,hahaha mean get issue cosmos ibc eco idea many drops bootstrap decentralization validators cases like creating massive centralization chains require fair amount time distribution occur post launch decentralization occur anyway decentralized large enough staked mcap many airdrops allocate give bonuses staking outside top 10 25 validators good incentive know get gg,decentralization time distribution decentralization 
332412,known issue pos given enough time validators acquire enough stake cause centralization ya think what's solution ,pos time stake 
332413,pow also issue geographical sense china miners ,pow

332420, vote abstain declare neutrality prop 16 because middle things hope proper correspondence core team gentlemen voted abstain prop 16 keep governance neutrality basically can't sell equalists come money right ,governance money 
332421,bad timing ,

332426,whale getting harpooned moment ,whale 
332427,good point ,
332428,could still vote tho abstain ,
332429, ,
332430, juno dev reference i'm whale harpooning via governance token gets sybiled bought bots particular event stakedrop tokens distributed atom holders 50k whale cap per entity person split 2mm atoms 50k accounts insider information consolidated receiving airdrop effectively recieving 11% chain rewards without ever investing anything chain clarify apparently also ran japanese ponzi sheme invested early atom perhaps even apparently ran tg scams actor could single handely drain liquidity rekt retail investors governance vote even close whale screwed unbonding period means tokens locked bad actor would still keep 50k juno 2mm usd ,governance token event tokens whale person airdrop chain chain liquidity rekt governance whale tokens usd 
332431,make stupid games get stupid prizes weird approach alltogether ,
332432,god forbid looked sybil addresses handing airdrop,addresses 
332433,dev forbid meant,
332434,wen chainalysis find wolf friends 100k accounts smokescreen keep equalists community happy ,
332435,unlikely distribuition atom holders 100% agree done earlier airdrop distribuition time actor recieving 11% chain rewards without investing single penny,airdrop time chain 
332436,can't figure still pay attention mockchains every year 5 better eths go nowhere ,year 
332437,make unlikely ,
332438, hello permissioned chain dev,chain 
332439,anyone idea % high usdt aave polygon ,usdt 
332440,''they gamed airdrop'' can't stand ''they're ponzi'' rally plebs ,airdrop 
332441,would purchase atoms would much easier increase team allocation case juno believe 2 5% tokens tokens distribuited via stakedrop atom holders,tokens tokens 
332442,huh bad whale accused splitting tokens 50k addresses tokens ,whale tokens 
332443,50k addresses split 2mm atoms addresses cap 50k atoms ,addresses addresses 
332444,owned tokens yes ,tokens 
332445,therefore maximizing airdrop circunventing whale cap 50k juno max per whale entity,airdrop whale whale 
332446,proof humanity solved repetitive airdrop drama ,airdrop 
332447,means dumb ,
332448,imo dumb part consolidated 1 8 2 2 mm juno 1 address made target community harpoon,address 
332449,community places targets dumb one begin,
332450,play communism backyard,
332451, ahem wen lawyers ,
332452,one year snapshot ,year 
332453,also gamed osmosis ,
332454,nearly much cuz quadratic still chainalalysis post provided earlier shows atoms split starting summer 2020 8 months stargate snapshot ,
332455,saying agree harpooning whales devs harpooning community voting 80% make distribuition fair even atom whales done earlier airdrop distribuition always elephant room actor could drain liquidity,airdrop liquidity 
332456,team think would leaked info mole 1 years drops blames whale may done got lucky safe following good security etiquette split clients funds ,whale 
332457,depends assume 80% cartel multiple addresses,addresses 
332458,really need pretend thing gubernance especially one implementing something obviously broken 50k address,address 
332459,harpooning whale sounds much cooler stealing money ey 100% team's fuckup quadratic multiple snaps etc want fix second prop ,whale money 
332460,atom ico eth btc several years ago icf still holds 1b btc eth think unlikely juno born 2021 devs would spent fortune gaming buying atoms receive larger allocation could increased team allocation imo fair stakedrop distribution atom community reference 50k atom 400k usd time snapshot airdrop distribuition whale friendly cap 400k usd juno vc investors distribuition 100% via stakedrop,ico eth btc btc eth distribution usd time airdrop whale usd 
332461,making assumptions nothing creating cartel,
332462, 50k address either extremely dumb extremely convenient seem dumb,address 
332463,feigning dumb though works,
332464,assumption team owns tokens atom ico 2017 juno born 2021 distribuition atom stakers dev team got 2 5% tokens,tokens ico tokens 
332465,plebs voted kill gamer whale c'est la vie,whale 
332466,claim anyone putting effort equalize bad whale put effort find really 2 5% ,whale 
332467,2 5% get together form cartel never lose vote voted carry,
332469,new ideas things improve chains trash sure sometimes good idea mix somewhere ultimately improve space ,
332475,real question isnt even whether whale bad actor discovered bad actor significant stake chain reason modify chain eliminate bad actor imo giving integrity chain way harmful potential bad actor large controlling stake chain ethereum parity hack contensious feel different reasons set precident like would illegal act due critical bug much room malisciousness ,stake chain chain chain stake chain ethereum 
332476,whats quite funny debo validator controlled whale admitted description let's exit scam noticed back long juno launched whale said bad english thought meant let's get rid scammers something effect seem odd maliscious entity attempting fly radar would write knowing actually means also consolidate accounts conscpicously chain ,whale exit long whale 
332477,parity hack iirc big bone contention fact community refused refund devopsfans accidental kill stuff,
332478,fact called hack ,
332479,sorry referring killing contracts event obviously term parity hack mind obviously actual hack stealing funds different event referring ,event term event

332689,research question remember hype around alternatives amm dexes one alternative pmm proactive market making idea simple instead simple invariant like cpmm x c models using oracles price feed mid price customized slippage formula checked cpmm traction 99% stablecoin pools dodo dex example question models work arbitrage attacks possible cpmm pools stablecoin pairs ,market stablecoin stablecoin 
332690,guys trivial google question fin discussion cause beginner privacy opsec stuff tbh barely anyone making big deals millions criminal stuff paranoid buying coins friends ,
332691, fin telegram whatsapp ,
332692,think problem need oracles obscure markets compete uniswap ,
332693,wen nodes oracles ,
332695,sure actually many oracles using lending protocols huge sector defi interesting research articles arbitrage models cpmm pmm seems like arbitrageurs making risk free profits one pool pmm certain peg amm somebody paying arbitrage draining liquidity pmm pool playing numerical models kinda time consuming anyone knows research articles topics please share p asymmetry industry new hype models hard finds critical research issues attack vectors protocols ,defi liquidity time attack 
332696,widely used alternative oracles chainlink ,
332697,afa i've seen either something finagling earlier mentioned uni x swap chainlink looking take chances ,
332698,next closest probably band that's proven reliable least year ago,year 
332699,two types chainlink usage 1 official price feeds trust limited number oracles partners link 2 custom dons decentralized oracles networks tbh see difficulties use link oracles open source infrastructure projects able support price feeds build dons ocr 2 0 validators able support several data feeds projects even forced use link nodes use ecaggregatorproxy interface oracles sure question somehow relevant devs btw question pmm amm arbitrage attacks reason pmf pmm moment ,trust source data interface 
332700,lolol remember coinmarketcap went batshit band used feed ppl got liquidated stablecoin positions,coinmarketcap stablecoin 
332702,building oracle otherwise robust exactly trivial practical many cases brings back initial problem nick mentioned,oracle 
332703,oracles issue lending protocols ,
332704,said earlier use chainlink one data chain link adventurous ones finagle something uni x swap,data chain 
332705,still disabled ,

333627,29 prs new one think anyone would going defi papers together maybe like little book club i've summarising papers decentralised collab well daoistry com also fundraising gitcoin i'm putting reading group together share highlights summaries ,one defi 
333628,might piste found old post oracle mechanisms interesting ,oracle 
333629,wait that's true accounting quotes need order get twap initialization,order 
333630,quoting univ3 costs 60k gas interaction i'm sure euler uses quotes expensive cost transferred user ,gas cost 
333631,reference i'm pro univ3 oracles p statement kinda tricky make,
333632,yes that's fair there's cross contract call computation let check gas estimates though would still contend net cost uni v3 oracle much much cheaper 3rd party provider would interesting see research ,contract gas cost oracle 
333633,imho straight forward example would seeing comparison ens using chainlink current vs using univ3 quoting pricing,
333634,reference could create much efficient chainlink style oracle uniswap v3's oracle,oracle oracle 
333635,chainlink choose subsidise oracle costs short term entirely fair comparison opinion ,oracle term 
333636,thing chainlink chainlink's holders pays whole party uniswap v3 user pay drink,
333637,reference also like chainlink's oracles there's clear trade offs two ,
333638,yep depends usage could cache uniswap quote reuse sufficient demand ,
333639,btw euler use quoting univ3 interaction borrow lending ,
333640,view chainlink unifying oracle bring enterprises use defi well,oracle defi 
333641,that's chainlink's moat,
333642,chainlink quoting ens registration 6k gas 10x less vs univ3 quoting ,gas 
333643,tool ,
333644,interesting arrive enterprise partners oracle data providers ,enterprise oracle data 
333645,tenderly,
333646,let's see happens make users pay usage,
333647, ,
333648,yep pretty much optimise parts caching though euler build batch transactions deposit multiple assets borrow multiple assets take long short position mint leverage etc etc single batch transaction ui save tonne gas ,transactions transaction gas 
333649,true 1 quote vs 10 interactions,
333650,that's really cool design tbh,

334328,happy help good overview come blog post l0 externally verified model trust oracles relayer given tx collude connext otoh currently locally verified system similar atomic swap we're heading towards new still trustless security model i'll posting blog post early next week tho ,trust system 
334330,respectfully assumption external validators inherently insecure outdated mpc networks thousands nodes run entirely tees node access secret shares security model plus extensibility bitcoin non evm support generalizability generic messaging third party contract layer external validators solves trilemma ,node non contract 
334331,cc philippzentner,
334332,question balancer nearly pools two three tokens reading whole idea seems 8 pools 1 active one,tokens 
334333,consolidated concentrate liquidity ,liquidity 
334335,really outdated economic security mpc system always economic security mpc validator set fundamentally distinct security underlying chains academic definition new trust assumption,system trust 
334336,acceptable trust assumption iff economic security system greater underlying chains,trust system 
334337,generally always false something like ethereum l1 tho,ethereum 
334338,i'm ramping solidity dev want tinker build apps want build semi public goal meet cool likeminded people work ask questions anyone recs dev groups developer dao one i've heard far,solidity developer 
334339,sure open new members right raid guild pretty great,
334340,straw man assuming mpc networks secured economically custodial mpc network relies integrity secret shares secure funds funds cannot lost secret shares cannot compromised primary security concern liveness safety ,
334341,thank put application,application 
334342,seems biggest problem using univ3 oracle long tail univ3 available many chains univ2 available everywhere keydonix seems interesting solution need pass additional argument merkel proof call vpepo repos good oracle modules recommend check aside mean finance ,oracle long proof oracle finance 
334344,problem proof ,proof 
334347,duplicate every single function relay oracle simply interact contracts without ui need generate proof ,function oracle proof 
334348,seen using twap potential exploits idea chainlink costs insane useless small project protocols,

335002,ye bridges seeing negative per se think bridges used defi protocols multichain bridges every protocol would need aave style multichain cross chain using terms correctly ,defi protocol chain 
335003, ,
335004,could add whitelisting top idk,
335005,yeah believe next 18 months major projects introduce form withdrawal latency benefits outweight downsides,
335006,could definitely introduce whitelist,
335007,totally words tbh first breaks ethos second could partially defeat purpose,
335008,yeah correct,
335009,think better approach add priority execution feature flashbots priority execution available special bots tracks happens inside defi protocol smart contracts operations mempool safe em bot sees malicious operation could pause protocol relatively speaking top defi protocols implement bots passable feature rather reliably protect hacks ,defi protocol smart protocol defi 
335010,think eden already chain priority feature,
335011,lol beef missed latest drama ,
335012,believe happen projects starting implementing architecture similar bentobox kashi multiple applications built top bentobox exit bentobox ecosystem general withdrawal latency could definitely interesting,exit 
335013,seeing think ,
335014,think possible,
335015,well creating chain cartel one argue sure works somehow hell tradfi take account main layer gov tokens security strip away ,chain tokens 
335016,solves composability issue applications collocate single vault e g bentobox moving applications deal withdrawal latency,e g 
335017,anyone build application top bentobox today think issue ,application 
335019,fully trusting basically unless slow true yet another security concern less power em,
335020,works theory hidden huge complexity defining detecting malicious operations easy first iteration attackers adjust attack rules set next iterations eventually would end situation similar heuristic analysis anti virus software meaning potential false positives lots things missed huge loss usability ,attack analysis

335026,wonder hacker funds broken really small ammounts seen ,
335027,goes strategies described initial tweet implement delay kind relative withdrawal size attacker split execution chunks different addresses would need apply rule total withdrawal throughput protocol suddenly limiting normal users dead end core issue things opinion fallacy make statements future attacks based past attacks without assuming attacker protection mechanisms example wormhole attacker could likely split 80k weth withdrawl 8000 1 weth without much effort ,addresses protocol protection 
335028,delay formula could take account excessive number addresses withdrawing short time frame yeah sure create new kinds problems,addresses time 
335029,could average withdrawal volume protocol lock exceeds n times threshold thats basically circuit breakers tricky defi like things run autonomously sure would want protocols manually resumed even multisig dao ,protocol defi 
335030,basically hire 1000 admins respond every small case,
335031,building like sounds like problem overhead anything,
335032,yes maybe secure closed less agile web2 hello,

335147,wonder % voting power needed something someone else assets sounds quite alarming highly centralized ,
335148,sure asking deflationary model burn token revenue happen u revenue token incentives data especially buyer persona thin inflation revenue absolutely always escape velocity blabla typical doin turn revenue model expanded hard milk users resource seems kk u shared though post op editing,token data inflation 
335150,sound alarming lido guys r good faith done good faith side tbh think things even possible erc20 contract standpoint temptation,contract 
335151,good counter argument i'm pretty interested read ,
335153,say decentralized search mean search google ,
335155,yes based decentralized storage make search engine ,
335156,way turn jit liquidity attack default method filling orders funds need sit lp pool traders could signal order jit could compete take reading dumb money lp seems waste programmatic traders could use flash loans fill swaps uniswap orders essentially limit orders would make sense bids compete fill,liquidity attack order money 
335157,model inflation based fact node's token gains come protocol gains that's regulation effect fact protocols node gains protocol gains pump dump staking regulation fail early protocol revenue come users ,inflation node protocol node protocol protocol 
335158,agree,

335169,yes i'm charge designing token economy design protocol dapp ethereum settlement layer similar thegraph search arweave ipfs miners run service search storage token incentive miners needed know downloading data centralized search good way go best user experience comes centralization blockchain ,protocol dapp ethereum ipfs data blockchain 
335170,ah okay makes sense ,
335171,looking decentralized file stores databases say want record users actions platform record data immutable manner blockchain using arweave ipfs filecoin seem lot solutions persisting files websites database could send data able prove never altered always available,file data ipfs data 
335172,number proposals arweave community people store layer1 data storage become layer0 ,data 
335175,sounds like something l2 would able provide future possibly subgraph mix sure current solutions exist describing essentially blockchain,
335176,ipfs cids give us never altered guarantee others try promise permanence like arweave ipfs based database solutions like orbitdb attempted that's probably closest describing thinks,ipfs ipfs

335801,foundation wallet always ends misused foundation print usually results delistings hard abandoning community consensus diff thing,wallet consensus 
335802,oh yeah seems fine realized dev went apply coingecko coingecko collect ,
335803,oh god pls yes tired seeing people talk fdv 70% supply simply allocated,
335804,70% unallocated quite low lots coins 97 5 95% locked,
335805,locked unallocated dao spending really fdv inflation lm already allocated fdv ,dao spending inflation 
335806,ah misunderstood,
335807, ivangbi maybe i'm missing something logic whole point fdv say market cap reach tokens enter circulation technically dao foundation market maker vesting team staking ever tokens exist easily enter circulation difference maybe dao spending board transparent investors ,market tokens market tokens spending 
335808, least that's view fdv many tokens might enter circulation time ,tokens time 
335809,daos spent like 1% spending far even tho like 1 year old really never ever 5 years even spend 50% really fdv sense make sense ,spending year 
335810,yeah get similar removing token emissions fdv emission rate 1 2% year tokens exist spent anyway much add stop ,year tokens 
335811,nobody inflates 1 2% year either larger close 0 ,year

335817,coingecko wants improve could work actually tagging different wallets specific conditions maybe even generate token distribution charts based new metric category marketcap fdv really needed also metrics basically useless misleading without strict due dillegence right feed coingecko api returning arbitrary number accept circulating supply afaik correct wrong general project wallet commit declared vesting release inflation schedules via smart contracts highlighted well simply verifiable whether stick conditions way things currently work way trust based basic assumption minted tokens circulating supply projects able submit conditions specific addresses correct soon chain movement invalidates conditions circulating supply increase ,distribution api wallet inflation trust tokens addresses chain 
335820,cg collect data namely specific wallets foundation team wallets vesting terms sure actively monitored adjust circ vs fdv,data 
335821,afaik show wallets substracted circulating supply without information except name thats optional also feed api whatever want accepted circulating supply right idea validation presentation could improved ,api

335832,wonderful idea,
335833,esd successful implementation concept,
335834,like frax fractionally backed usdc ,

335840,hey folks would recommend offline crypto events london ,crypto 
335841,guess better way frame i'm wondering mechanisms besides full backing seigniorage also probably need get precise seigniorage exactly rough understanding peg buy burn seigniorage token peg mint sell seigniorage token seems right really work protocols use tricks stabilize peg ,burn token work 
335842,look fei guess,
335843,except work,work 
335844,certainly doesnt work seen many failed algo undercollateralized stables works needs bootstrapped maintained carefully ,
335845,fair point seigniorage coins currently ust luna frax partially ,
335846,pretty much sure bunch others without meaningful volume usage seem work problems usually first show pressure ,work 
335847,went back dig relevant ,
335848,understanding fei model e fully collateralized eth relevant reading ,e 
335849,yes there's mechanism regarding protocol reacts undercollateralized raises question need 100% maybe achieve 50% cr maybe less iunno,mechanism protocol 
335850,yes jcny hard pegged usdc polygon ,
335851,liquidate collateralized minters happens imagining worked bit like 0 cost loan protocol deposit collateral get fei maintain minimum collateralization ratio get liquidated,bit cost protocol

335862,trilemma decentralized price stability capital efficiency,
335863,what's seigniorage posted understanding mint sell buy burn ,burn 
335864,also push back bit think there's many ways could potentially algorithmic stablecoins,bit 
335865,price stability ,
335866,well unless fei mechanics changed collateralization entire stable coin reserve per minter dynamics protocol less eager buy shitty prices price goes 1 protocol buy really bad rate hand mint great rate way around price 1 afaik ,coin protocol protocol

336491,convex return also nft please compare solidity nft vs convex returned tokens,solidity tokens 
336492,partially personally think eth less governance impact eth chain still leads centralization st eth actually stands eth rewards aka added bonus system tends work better cvxcrv nothing farm token st eth somewhat value backing nonetheless staked eth controlled lido controlled governance token almost votes private seed team ye centralized nonetheless exactly model imo,eth governance eth chain eth eth system work eth eth governance seed

336505,think missing point i'm making entirely agree single entity monopoly derivative issuance layer bad pointing protocol one allows staked tokens wrapped transferrable whether nfts erc20 tokens entirely self defeating pointless ethereum issued wrapped erc20 token representing staked eth validators would defeat entire point staking eth validator first place ,protocol one tokens tokens self ethereum eth 
336506,spotify cryprocurrency podcast recommendation thanks,

336508,3rd party adding transferable token result meaninglessness logic ,

336516,hmm looking one day traders necessarily leverage ,
336517,thats model leads original one illiquid though fact whatever want,
336518,venfts pretty much sellable aside otc whatever real important part comes utilization borrowing etc ,
336519,need create governance token make lockable without transfer 1 entity owns voterights anything anyways due fact point thats mean indirectly ruin idea venfts better maybe maybe try fix issue finding balance,governance 
336520, ,
336521,leads us normal people care governance therefore normal people governance work,governance governance work 
336522,really already explained agree monopoly one entity controlling staked asset avoided obviously entire point make sure vibrant economy entities form hypothecate derivative staked non transferrable token like hope case staked eth single man show lido ,
336523,agree theres multiple entities fighting good ecosystem also risk ruin governance aka crv convex,governance 
336524,way fight monopoly wrap staked asset protocol layer thus completely ruin economic system way solve foster vibrant decentralized distribution staked asset basically arguing eth issue wrapped version staked eth lido cannot capture 51% staked eth terrible idea issuing liquid staked eth completely destroys security guarantees pos ,protocol system distribution eth eth pos 
336525,one entity holding tokens necessarily bad depends control structure entity nobody generally objects daos holding 50% token treasury spend see fit long faux governance ala time cvx ownership fairly well distributed ,tokens governance time 
336526,whole vote bad dump fast attack really problem reality market react bad votes weigh versus centralized entity like convex controlling curve,dump attack market

337035,whole soon ai ml deanonymize tornado users thing also highly questionable kind magic work around cryptography likely reduce manual effort needed unmasking people made mistakes first place ,work cryptography 
337036,researched question one found great stuff using smart contracts ddos attack mitigation ,attack 
337037,mentioned know described system works exactly well something compare based studies ,know system 
337038,anyway original question practical application blockchain ml ai concepts went far definitely trying fud tornado awesome tutela received grant well ,application blockchain fud 
337039, approach proposes architecture implementation approach signaling white blacklisted ip addresses across multiple domains based blockchains smart contracts advantage using smart contracts blockchain make use already existing infrastructure distribute rules without need build specialized registries distribution mechanisms protocols b apply rules across multiple domains means even autonomous system victim applying rules traffic still filtered c victim control customers get blocked central element remaining show proof ip ownership seems relevant part idea basically use public blockchain distribute filter rules attacker ips ,addresses distribution system proof blockchain 
337040,cryptography seeing 1 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 allows narrow significantly,cryptography 
337041,humans like centralize that's vector ml driven analysis,analysis 
337042,get idea thats exactly works already ,
337043,yes nsa software identify based way write i'm gonna suprised they've already cracked torn,
337044,people math always weak link systems like,
337045,yeah 100 people 0 1 eth 100 people take 0 1 eth able find exactly responsible deposit ,eth eth 
337046,like writing styles tons unique markers ,
337047,yes one person steals exactly 385 2 eth fragments another wallet slowly receives 385 2 eth course several weeks start make educated guesses need parallel construction,person eth wallet eth 
337048,see likely reduce manual effort needed unmasking people made mistakes first place ,
337049,assuming split walelts withdrawn fixed increments like 1 eth,eth 
337050,putting 385 2 eth withdrawing exact amount single wallet kind mistake talking even problem plausible deniability ,eth wallet 
337051,think vastly underestimating computing power thrown problems like remember deal computers today crypto records gonna around 5 10 20 years computing improved even,crypto 
337052,people thinks ml analytics solve lt wont think regulators demand full kyc resource funds every single wallet used mixers couple years ,kyc wallet 
337053,throw much computing power ai ml want possible logical solution problem wont get solution ,
337054,yes sufficient datasets assume sake argument i'll know exchange accounts slowly withdrew around 385 2 eth seemingly showed torn wallets ,exchange eth 
337055,basically saying unmask people dataset allows unmasking point many cases wont due nature tornado works ai magically going change dont input variables output want lets say 10 people interact tornado cash exactly way never able tell apart beyond reasonable doubt ,cash doubt 
337056,tornado magically going keep private,
337057,technology use properly used properly theres also limits ai ,technology 
337058,seem missing point amount x went torn anon wallet amount x flowed bank account wallets known control came torn watching flows reasonably narrow list people received x scrutinize thoroughly start adding personal level something add easily apply scrutiny found right person,wallet person 
337059,could certainly see someone making risk score per wallet based already known patterns interacted tornado hold compromised eth sure something specific wallet hack relevant level one needs keep monitoring wallets abnormal activity dig deeper needed manually ,wallet eth wallet 
337060,cba discuss certainly whos missing point gn,
337061,know value created know value destroyed know flows list unknowns need solve data lasts forever whenever get new tech throw problem sound like winning game,know know data 
337062,simple though one using properly doesnt matter anyway far nuanced convo pretty useless ,
337064,thats like saying able determine whether 2 2 actual square root 4 need technology computing power ,technology 
337065,discussion reminds good quote theory theory practice practice ,
337066,i'm claiming narrow 100% confidence narrow set small really make difference human,
337067,kind like image recognition got point computer could reliably tell difference dogs cats got good multiple layers took 3 decades phone background,
337068,maybe could track every 20 dollar bill used today doxx based information ,dollar 
337069,tornado free,
337073,protocol free gas optional use relayers ,protocol gas 
337074,part proper functionality either way saying unmask people basically put neon sign backs announcing wasted time using tornado cash means ai brockshane contraption unmask everyone reads manual impressive case jumping conclusions bias due exploit notwithstanding,time cash 
337075,handwaving away unsolvable problem saying ai solve really make sense ,
337076,may silly i'll give bandits may redeploy set adjacently related addresses leave enough breadcrumbs pattern recognition tool ai connect dots back astute bandit would put work ensure modularized sequester stream exit points destinations example desire found high enough fragment aggregation time location disappear use burn bury 3 10% cheaper paying taxes think larger challenge reliably wash get want meat space ,addresses work exit points time wash

337842,usdn waves redemptions happen smart contract without link orderbooks centralized exchanges thing 'mark price' based main waves usdt pairs,contract usdt 
337843,even tomorrow collateralization drops example 120%,
337844,would directly impact waves usdt would impact traders,usdt

337850,yeah that's issue,
337851,think that's addressed properly it'll balance,
337852,yes changed new system time storm lol,system time 
337853,meant centralize process looks like idiotic decision since no1 arbitrage,

337887,crosschain narrative,
337888,brains blow ,
337889,barely know appchain,

337897,yes sir,

337900,osmosis dex appchain,

337903,lmao could banned ivangbi flushing,
337904,nah okay u fine ser ,
337905,dapps become bigger think chain sure,chain 
337906, ,
337907,think app chain thing think app agnostic optimized chains natively bridge,chain 
337908,never understood polkadot auctions slots allows parachains become pretty close app specific instead launch large amount interconnected common goods chains,
337909,let know anyone wants hire smart contract developer erc20 erc721,contract developer 
337910,benefits appchain,
337911,appchains allow developers customize applications terms governance structure economic design underlying consensus algorithm appchain self governed economy code defined explicit processes reach agreements protocol upgrades,developers governance consensus self protocol 
337912,cosmos ibc future,
337913,like dfk subnet solve jewel inflation problem,inflation 
337914,yeah agreed see one chain per app scale vs common optimized chains example dfk need chain need gaming optimized one low decentralizatin high transaction throughput ,chain chain transaction 
337915,somehow figure highly reliable highly secure highly fast easy use bridges i'd agree definitely see happening though,
337916,relates blockchain trilemma l1 couldnt handle dapp need find scaling solution,blockchain dapp 
337917,become appchain ,
337918,nah necessarily example dot one parachain super low collator count effectively accomplishing without needing build bridges etc,
337919,security problem appchain validator 1 team,
337920,allow app specific parachain slots gets used bunch random projects might go anywhere,
337921,made thread fits ct topos aka might quite degens part core hopefully sums things well give good first glance leveraging crypto nfts design economy undermine funding issues tradart b question act collecting live art end thread there's github docs links leave introduction i'd really happy collect feedbacks willing share really like guys seem well aware need position listen take feedbacks account genuinely wanna meet new minds new mindsets kinda cool ,ct crypto 
337922, punch made typos thread ahah frenchies ans english long story ,

337925,dont know need time see,time 
337926,well like osmosis dydx dfk ,
337927,agreed also question many differently optimized chains need build games certainly must level makes sense,
337928,there's nothing unique unprecedented people think app devs interested faffing around consensus like make app people selling called app chains,consensus 
337929,gotta verify audit chain code smart contracts,chain 
337930,oh claim coming ,
337931,delegate u ivan ,
337932,vote exit dao give money ,exit dao money 
337933,sounds good much pay delegators ,
337934,mean alameda research says provide market making services essentially buy good portion supply makes continuous buys sells essentially always top bid ask orderbook ,market 
337935,top close maintain tight spread larger orders happen without moving market much also prevents massive abritrage oppose one scamware cex de pegs another actually volume well reality arb yeah ,market 
337936,okay one side like possible service provides liquidity sells letting buys volatile ,liquidity 
337937,ask even decide tell first place opaque also depends work require notional capital thenother side book use like wintermute time period profit split engagement directionally think asset usually mm invest semantics basically find looking trying deduct behavior sheer involvement mms magic ,work time 
337938,mm means providing spread ask bids takes make market ,ask market 
337939,playbook get lent tokens mm fine carry risk get spread also usually get given free option receive tokens say 6month price k ,tokens tokens k 
337940,quite interesting thanks ,
337941,sounds like dumb question think various protocols offering smart contracts service scaas uniswap provides scaas form permissionless liquidity pools anyone deploy combination 2 erc 20 tokens gnosis safe provides scaas proxy implementation new proxy contracts deployed created point canonical gnosis safe interface contract contains logic needed transactions would reasons two different forms people deploy smart contracts would happen uniswap used proxy implementation liquidity pools instead ,permissionless liquidity erc tokens interface contract transactions liquidity

338090,oh yeah sure different pitch different communities though really planning shilling here's website want check us ,
338091,seems like would really benefit rmrk nfts going held back erc721 looks great can't wait try gaming resurgence making miss gaming ,
338092,actually going ahead erc1155 erc721 yet stage make final decision wrong rmrk polkadot right ,
338093,btw want try playable demo bit rough around edges bugs still fun pre alpha dm email enable access ,bit 
338094,evm contracts testing rust pallets mvp state currently run colored coins mode aiming cover much ground possible happy show around plenty games already developing us one diablo like thing one thing similar single player experience course skybreach thing happy explore options collabing,state 
338095,oh interesting really deep dived polkadot solutions mostly concentrating developing ecosystem around application specific rollup definitely intrigues ,application 
338096,hey ivangbi what's conditions eligible claim ,
338097,lol thx actually know gear claim,
338098,delegate cryptojohnboone eth,eth 
338099,always ready paranoidal low level decentralisation crypto web3 defi stablecoins affected usa decisions usdc data storage rely centralized products node networks dependence centralized infrastructure etc time almost defi native products rely decentralised governance means token holders power largest token holders biggest defi protocols much power brief analysis ethplorer snapshot shows picture example uni aave dydx 17 5m 8m holdings one biggest token holder average number votes last proposals uni 1 5m 250k aave 25m 25m dydx guess one biggest token holder binance least wallets tagged ethplorer binance understand binance token holder participate governance though usually cex binance would want become malicious actor power propose first suspend withdrawals stake gov tokens needed vote malicious proposal hurt defi ecosystem yes look binance cex like potential single points failure defi world hope mistake logic,crypto defi usdc data node time defi governance token defi analysis token governance stake tokens proposal defi points defi 
338100,i've mentioned couple times really hope long term crypto moves away token voting bi cameral system like house senate one side votes straight tokens one side 1 vote per unique human guess small minimum token requirement things pass get passed ,term crypto system 
338101,obviously would make decision making even way slower already see board directors elected way maybe even liquid voting users delegate tokens directors ,tokens 
338102,kind polkadot works right ways gotta say loving ,
338103,proposal interesting terms centralization decentralization ,proposal decentralization 
338104,works really well systems enough validator room low capacity validator systems much whales tend make bunch validators push everyone ,capacity 
338105,yeah combine random selection block producer boom higher decentralization lower incentives run many nodes,block decentralization 
338106,agree lot different ways improve voting system chosing way traditional llc works board directors etc exotic methods though moment i'm interested question problem mentioned really exists yes looks strange we're trying decentralize democratize almost everything talking fear governments amazon etc time whole system affected one person cz ,system fear time system person 
338107,clear system would rely sort unique personhood thing yet exist,system 
338108,there's personhood voting dot right token voting board directors understand teh technical board actually replaced token vote ,technical 
338109,really democratizing governance definition oligarchizing time that's likely best 100% believe need move forward ,governance time 
338110,tricameral theory plebs council technical committee practice really proof personhood despite us knowing people council tech committee actual unique people really help regards technical decentralization decision making ,technical decentralization 
338111,much released internally mean start 100m right away released 2m circulation per week fast ,
338112,making personhood voting substrate chain though biometric consensus layer ,chain consensus 
338113,ah yeah guess theory plebs would split plebs lots tokens plebs 1 tokens,tokens 
338114,yeah that'd super cool basis bi cameral house senate type voting system personally think representative democracy work better direct democracy lower level decision making think there's good arguments,type system work 
338115,works basically plebs either many tokens use vote interesting anti whale mechanics voting system whole kinda broken right revamped ,tokens system 
338116,i'll check realize nouance thanks ,
338117,love trying make progress towards actual democracy seems like everyone else content oligarchy strategy probably oligarchs ,
338118,yeah pending change coming different tracks councils different parts chain aspects vs one council everything one tech committee everything ideally councils specialize etc ,chain 
338119,plus anti sniping added proposals sure day one ,
338120,ah interesting sounds like swiss style governance 7 presidents executive board directors specializes one 7 departments,governance 
338121,see dms ser,
338122,convinced also need deliberative branch randomly selected holders,
338123, ,
338124,think liquid token voting delegate tokens people redelecte time likely better outcome hard get random people speed end something similar us jury trials really known particularly consistent,tokens time us 
338125,actually research bit nuanced ,bit 
338126,think mixed system liquid democracy representative deliberative solid,system 
338127,goal able integrate complexity human governance crypto ream go beyond liberal democracies ok far far good ,governance crypto 
338128,disagreeing commenting 10 different jury exact trial likely end 10 consistent verdicts issue good decision quality engage public,public 
338129,yeah agree comparing think good compare also existing mechanism parliaments also good habit come 10 different solutions confronted issue question % epistemic vs social process achieve,mechanism 
338130,deliberative processes good begin epistemic,
338131,working policial matters,

338150,meant solve governance issues support process make robust verifiable efficient ,governance 
338151,yeah that's i'm actually debugging point badmouth dev best thinking would cool tool exports sample project docs based natspec kind like swagger fe shows call given functions sample params point easier help ,

338153,yeah much else party lacks essential skills knowledge babysit train replace ,
338154,know that's i'm saying though rails facilitate efficiency governance process cannot solve issues governance unrelated efficiency governance process likely compound make even glaringly obvious ,governance governance 
338155,depends experience level frontend dev new web3 think would prefer give typescript wrapper takes care setting plumbing exposes interface makes easier consume frontend app ,interface 
338156,that's really interesting understand correctly ts would wrap smart contract function calls expose type safe interface would act documentation sorts see working completely new case level keep idea mind ,contract function type interface 
338157,yep exactly treat almost blackbox separation concerns experience makes updates ui ux modular ,

338698,funding rates borrow rates sorry silly note rates imbalance great question 1 markets never ever anywhere efficient even boomer good information asymmetry 2 even information perfect risk perceived differently passive lps would rather make lower apy susceptible liquidations different risk tolerance 3 making yields converge cross chain still early af stage 4 etc ,tolerance chain

338754,asking discussion beyond article enemy ,
338755,sorry ser felt differently bad anyhow guess u say kinda multisig specific assets think u make kind guardian staking contract u stake erc assets security measure think would need testing thinking bet lot people got hacked would live way save assets even though got hacked think staking implemented token,contract stake 
338756,basically multisig ,
338757,yep kinda,
338758,something like eth pos cause slashing ,eth pos

338773,would advise use hardware wallet,wallet 
338774,hmm set tornado cash like zk based nfts still place virtual staking instead guardian transfer nft address backup key ,cash nft address key 
338775,yeah thought revest clone first something bit different similar function fnfts though standardized manner concept decent one however existence smart wallets kinda obviates true staking mechanism use eip 1167 deploy smart wallet lock assets smart wallet transfer ownership smart wallet nft,bit function mechanism eip wallet wallet wallet nft 
338776,granted want security mechanism avoid bayc getting stolen pretty good option,mechanism 
338777,reminds credit freeze irl,

338779,really keep address secured hardware wallet stake dubious ponzis ,address wallet stake 
338780,still xenforo forums times dat stuff thank awesome tip ,
338781,yes that's i'd recommend however see angle guy coming,
338782,yeah idea makes sense basically non custodial staking tries address problem verify chain verification chain whether someone moves assets therefore reliably distribute rewards based basically hook notifies staking contract asset moved ,staking address chain chain contract 
338783,think point guardian contract 721 disable transfers contract level mind that's useful person compromising wallet realize valuable seen exact scenario play revest someone lost private keys hacker took everything fnfts containing value rest assets put together know impacted user able wait month return wallet transfer impacted assets hacker moved security obscurity secure method still break hackers figure going ,contract contract person wallet wallet secure 
338784,fair still ton people clicking random things even like 15 years,
338785,opinion never able fix give people self custody going stupid things way solve taking custody away thats called web2 ,self custody custody 
338786,suppose impression prevented transfers anyways wrap eip 1167 asset appear static transfer rights access smart wallet matter exact way rvst work lqdr gets around base curve mechanics one lock per wallet use contract based smart wallets tied nfts allow staking via proxy custom smartwalletchecker whitelist everything taking liquidity vecrv positions,wallet work wallet contract liquidity

338839,yup convo continue fugezi ,
338840,apologies sir meant internal r defacto act internal auditing firm,
338841,really different things anyway garbage invest often par polkastarter rugs,
338842,imagine top tier audit firm took payments seed allocations,seed 
338843,could probably yield higher flat fee,
338844,actually second thought making good point smarter structure would vc firm bulk deal someone like trail bits allow portfolio companies pick auditing time even matter expensive anymore basically impossible even get time vc firm guarantees access would big leg getting cap table,time time 
338845,causes huge conflict audit public instead internal use,
338853,vc want tangled sort attacks none parties liable,
338854,case event people always point fingers least would want internal audit team fault correct ,event 
338855,vcs poaching hiring auditors top tier auditing firms establish internal auditing division team matter fact already happening within vc landscape strange would think ,
338856,i'm gonna name vc tell happening,
338857,makes sense one biggest upfront expenses toughest squeeze connections lot new protocols,
338858,agree general vcs negative reputation space competition increases crypto native vcs raising shit load capital web2 tradfi institutions entering space higher strategic value add required demanded crypto projects protocols providing gtm support bd tokenomics introductions network becoming less strategic day vcs keep boosting value add remain relevant space therefore offering tech support product testing feedback governance support audits crazy may think,crypto crypto tokenomics product governance 
338860,yeah one wants vc audit instead hiring auditors vc firm makes sense establish partnership audit firm,
338861,certain ,
338862,offering help code one thing probably want publicly say audited vc firm audits supposed independent examination conflict interest degree retail already sceptic vcs think would perceived well would create credibility vc firm expertise etc way simpler make partnership auditing firm could even invest,

338979,data specific encoding format dune request contract abi added data decoded ,data format contract data 
338980,yeah already submit contract address decoding curious whether find patterns data ,contract address data 
338981,challenge may they're arrays rather types ,
338982,output includes array lengths ,

338990,yeah way array length fixed 4 ,
338991, ,
338993,turns 2 ,
338994,also sure whether two arrays length still extract ,
338995, ,
338996,bytecode array always start length array ,
338997,right params indexed applies parameters without indexed attribute abi encoded data part log need x k elements k assumed type uint256 enc x enc k enc x 0 x k 1 first value length array k k fixed length pieces containing values array,data k k type k k k 
338998, cactushoes freeatnet got appreciate help ,
338999,dune decoded values need decode resources dune postgres database afaik ,
339000,might wrong decode exactly actually always takes bit messing beware paddings also note x len enc x multiple 32 ,bit 
339003,wow really helps first two rows mean ,
339004,trying figure well,
339005,something related parameter name ,
339006,think encoding 2 dynamically sized arrays follow quite figure done ,
339007,array1 len n0 n1 etc array2 len n0 n1 etc array1 len array2 len etc etc ,
339008,think part tuple encoding see rule 1 encoding t1 tk types dynamic head x 1 head x 2 start value head x offset beginning tail x relative start knowing data contains 2 dynamically sized arrays read first 32 bytes tells byte offset first array length read second 32 bytes tells byte offset second array length,data 
339009,byte offsets,
339010,sorry yes correct,
339011,love good brain teaser sunday night ,

339053,launch contracts ain't verified can't snipe etherscan,etherscan 
339054,either would need bot swap limit slip,
339055,seriousness set high slippage get tax argument ui tells upfront price impact whats point overly generous ,

340708,forget multichain anycall tech different protocols uses different approach especially terms architecture us believes approach best multichain believe smpc nodes network best approach end maybe fully correct answer dont think infighting solution ,
340709, forgot mentioning anyswap multichain,
340710,router protocol,router protocol 
340711,think,
340712,think challenge category lack understanding around even things basic constitues bridge mean liquidity network mint burn token bridge generalized message passing channel cosmos ibc credit project focused building underlying data channels since early token transfers one specification sending packets zones however given massive need non cosmos chains yesterday seeing proliferation high quality teams building infra evm environments standards language fragmented makes hard non technical user understand going hood allows playing loose fast positioning,liquidity channel data token non 
340713,ahaha saying make mention protocols saying simple,
340714,indeed pranaymohan rightly pointed standards different approaches significant tradeoffs hard evaluate retail non technical users easily swayed narrative positioning ,
340715,soon new cross chain message aggregator emerge heavy lifting devs select bridge use sending messages beleive ibc standard become base standard implemented layerzero others also implement socket already great job aggregating liquidity bridge soon might also data bridging ,chain standard standard liquidity 
340717,ooh yeah movr network socket tech working really cool several big brain folks really ultra passionate different approaches speaking aggeregators li fi aggregates 'em btw knowledge primarily asset transfer soon data transfer tooo there's across protocol one awesome lane ,data protocol 
340719, ,
340721,fud really possible ,
340722,aggregators taking positive slippage long know feature doubt tho user quoted 35k ui ,doubt 
340723,read comments likely 50% slippage ,
340724,ibc protocol seem like best tool job trivial implement outside cosmos based chains however multiple parties working implementations light clients ,protocol 
340725,xcm pretty great advantages ibc allows incentivised message passing also ensures message executed correctly via spree think xcm dark horse race one seems talking,
340726, another thread look,
340727, ,
340728,llama stonk,
340729,beauty decentralized systems anyone make improvement proposals considered community use cases evolve see new token standards created characteristics solve larger ecosystem ultimate list token standards evm non evm chains ,improvement non 
340731,doesnt matter slippage used still stealing lol,
340732,slippage couple days back fell broke hip i'm calcium tablets ,
340733,data onchain click decode input data see minreturnamount 18138 minreturnamount amount user quoted slippage user specified unless user trading 50% slippage settings 1inch fact quoted 18k yeti keeping everything quoted amount standard 1inch monetize service like check paraswap believe used take 50% positive slippage sure current approach firebird collect positive slippage rather takes 0 05% service fee swap ,data data 
340734,positive slippage big part aggregators earn revenue pretty sure paraswap 0x think sure ,
340735,pretty bad model,
340736,ton ways trade go bad user introduced another one ,one 
340737,could use low slippage ,
340738, 5 1%,
340739,get hyped launch low slippage,
340740,would use 1inch get hyped launch ,
340741,interact router directly etherscan example,router 
340742,also allows put slippage want,
340743,well personally everyone knows ways,
340744,million dollar question,dollar 
340745,happen slippage though ,
340746,since price lower tokens returned 1inch gives user min amount still less value,tokens 
340747,get price quoted 0 5% 1% problem use 1inch look aggregators fund way whilst still honouring price quote seen new launches advising buyers use aggregator service search back november last year discussed maybe earlier ,fund year 
340748,thats point using aggregators usually launch one platform right pay extra gass,

340775,hmm what's preventing people selling snx mechanism prevents happening since staking traditional sense,mechanism 
340776,snx locked repay burning susd can't sell,

340792,effectively launching solidity fork 1 1 airdrop existing solid holders unlocked tokens thing canon imo etc canon ,solidity fork airdrop tokens 
340793,judging chain activity believe eth canon etc kind asymetric bet hardcore ethos,chain eth 
340794,ye situation would similar eth etc users prefer fixed protocols vs others stick original,eth 
340795,canon ultimately decided culturally right,
340796,'layer zero' consensus people feel like eth canon etc uniswap definitely canon sushi best guess people see existing solidly non canon creator longer working got bugs open source almost seems fair game beneficial reboot,consensus eth non source 
340797,uni sushi different tho team active og vs fork story rather canon orphan story,fork 
340798,said i'm reboot team well,
340799,ultimately similar thought process guess one real one one fake copy fork non canon,fork non

340818,pls,
340819,would honestly projects try wacky new token models rather everybody going 'eh venomics alright lets try,
340820,works alright curve mean it'll work would rather see experimentation tbh,
340821,i'd say works project need governance yeah experimentation token models absolutely necessary ,governance token 
340822, ,
340823, ,
340824,guess hard projects commit 'try something new' could tank bags bigly wacky tokenomics ideas public good whole space,tokenomics

340898, simple fix makes oracle attacks fuse pools financially infeasible choose appropriate gamma pool think would classify guard rail since borrowing power follows organic price increase time scale snapshot distance could probably chosen aggressively something like couple hours even shorter thoughts technical reason prevents design ,oracle time

340900,who's paying make checkpoints ,
340901,hm choose 24h checkpoints maybe simply pool operator manageable think ,
340902,expensive roughly write 24h twap chain ,chain 
340903,24h sounds like lifetime considering volatility things might make sense stable fiat coins much everything else cost vpepo posted stuff like,fiat 
340904,really interesting idea ,
340905,also relevant considering infrequently oracle updated ,oracle 
340906,hey everyone guys know could find info regarding protocols exploits correlation audits found info saying 21 22% protocols exploited unaudited mean much know global percentage unaudited protocols range studied like maybe top 1000 projects something like goes info available rekt ,rekt 
340907,3 4 eth initialize regarding reading around 200k gas per call,eth gas 
340908,proposing somewhat similar done keep3r btw uses 5 day twap ,
340910,correction reading 25k gas per observe initialization ,gas 
340911, sources,
340912,make trigger borrows 24h period went one borrows gets updated whenever ,
340913,curious vulnerable someone manipulating price beforehand borrowing ,
340914,thanks yeah that's i've looking i'm wondering stats top 500 1000 protocols know many actually audited want see audits actually helps refrain exploiters way i'm 100% convinced ,
340915,whenever borrow update collateral liquidated block rather next one ,block 
340916,manipulation can't happen within block like manipulation borrow ,block 
340917,hmm ,
340918,iirc quote updates start new block,block 
340919,would manipulate easily arbitragable sufficient market ,market 
340920,liquidated borrow would rather limited due 24h twap 20% threshold ,
340921, note oracle updated every block calling observe secondsago value 0 return recently written observation recent beginning current block older ,oracle block block

340927,checkpoint reference actual twap used,
340928,every 24 hs update 24h twap order reference 15 minute twap goes 20% reference refuse update maintain old value,order 
340929,ah see reply,
340930,slight tangent would done anything inverse exploit ,
340931,yeah,

340942,yeah,
340943,also need store timestanp guard could perhaps lose precision price pack together since need reading time ,time

340951,thinking liquidations due genuine price drops 30% like hardly unprecedented,
340952,nbanft nation3 crazy ,
340953,checkpoint idea meant protect protocol standard attack 1 deposit collateral 2 manipulate oracle increase borrowing power drastically 3 borrow much assets pool effects liquidations might issue possible let smart contract use different value decide eligibility liquidations value takes decide borrowing power must 2 things fundamentally linked together ,protocol attack oracle contract 
340954,however see problem price goes could elaborate worried liquidations would occur since checkpoints lagging notice proposal uses minimum function min collateral price gamma last checkpoint price price drops everything simply works though checkpoints exist checkpoints effect price increases ,proposal function

341052, primordialaa exactly example dunking wrapped assets help clear risk representational assets escrow underlying omnichain tokens supply peg one chain risk underlying trust root compromised supply peg broken ,tokens chain trust 
341053,see fundamental technical obstacles implementing something like ser visibility twitter hard get feedback ,twitter 
341054,anything across two chains risk underlying transport protocol compromised nature messaging work improving validation mechanisms interesting,protocol work 
341055,important point ,
341056,agreed solution wrapped assets seen team criticize solution generating representational liquidity stargate capitalizes liquidity pools point making selective use terminology make positioning marketing case ignores still risk since agree early industry need help educate vocabulary launder ,liquidity liquidity 
341057,issue wrapped assets clearly carries risk post transaction e tx x b risk transaction also entire duration b exists 20b outflow insert total wrapped flow chain chain b 20b standing risk forever unwrapped meaning transport like corrupted tx point tx risk end user always carries exposure something like stargate pay higher premium latent liquidity completely removes standing risk e 20b outflow chain chain b done without user ever exposed risk outside risk immediate tx without overall system risk ever exceeding amount currently stargate pools ,transaction e transaction chain chain meaning liquidity e chain chain system 
341058,100% correct escrow risk persists indefinitely post settlement layer transfer two questions 1 get exposure assets like eth supply peg mainnet need representational asset capitalize pools liquidity network like stargate right unless ever expecting fully native deployments like usdc permissionless tokens offer 2 flagging application risk smart contract performs escrow function bulletproof apprehension go away ,eth mainnet liquidity permissionless tokens application contract function 
341059,answer omnichain token native deployments everywhere rebalance liquidity using l0 trust root risk ,liquidity trust 
341060, thanks answering q btw ,
341061,2 basically taken care light client bridge model,
341062,1 never get native gas assets chain without wrapping extremely clear think interesting question want need save another day 2 consensus layer fails standing risk still exposed smart contract risk persists method period nobody solves writing good code problem standing 20b risk example validation consensus layer fails corrupted forges tx ,gas chain consensus contract consensus 
341063,well yes ,
341064,would say yes obviously disagree,
341065,2 yeah true omnichain assets well trust root compromised tokens get inflated ,trust tokens 
341066,going say ethereum avalanche still need need somebody pass next block right still exposure people malicious verified,ethereum block 
341067,course like said transport layers carry risk,
341068,question shape surface,
341069,criticize wrapped assets,
341070,apples apples criticism,
341071,mean wrapped assets carries standing risk stargate carries static risk,
341072,fairly clear,
341073,jackzampolin clear straightforward forever think light client model best current model impractical current systems gas chains reduced factor 1000 10000 would absolutely implement validation library default everything,gas

341521,wrap way that's digestible average user make sure slow fuck we're good go way see people like already easily run access decentralized frontends that's matters product like uniswap ,
341522,hmm that's browsers like brave services like eth link comes guarantees still exist way access abstracted away perfect ofcourse introduces points failure still way average user access site ,eth points 
341523,someone needs host though something ipfs offer anything either case need think hard shutdown let cloudflare case see eth limo says lot without saying anything reading links medium content privacy policy tos certainly quite interesting,ipfs eth 
341524,right initial pinner still liable afaik,
341525,one run ipfs pinner,ipfs

342559,brilliant ty,
342560,find details works technicalities ,
342561,publish technical blog post next week general outline follows mms manage pools chains hold inventory assets native chain trader requests quote mms use inventory issue quote trader submits tx onchain one transfer happens source chain network validators relayers confirm tx deliver payload destination chain perform second transfer ,chain source chain chain 
342562,pricing handled chain via signed rfqs get around things like sandwich attacks cross domain mev cuz nothing front run,chain 
342563,managing mms validators relayers ,
342564,aight thank look forward technical papers,
342565,frens technical question sure create multiple accounts metamask one private key compromised attacker get pks related one ,
342566,like reverse pk seed,seed

342585,trading completely decentralized permissionless custodying funds anyone full control trade submission receive quote ,trading permissionless 
342586,permissionless means decision use yeah means anyone use i'm curious happens validators relayers mms get request someone that's exploited protocol also non custodial sure decentralized mean ,permissionless protocol 
342587,need mms actually handle pools tap existing liq pools cross chain settle need bridge period matching mm rfqs wont settle origin destination chain bridge right pools stables let's say want sell bnb get eth two trades bridge happen bnb stable stable moved stable eth ,chain chain eth eth 
342588, ,

342863,curve uni cannot,
342864,aave afaik,
342865,yeah permissioned mitigation logic,
342866,many hacks happening lately true gathering attention big players also true 1 protocol exploit week growing gonna kinda hard ,protocol 
342867,imagine telling fund might risk capital exploiter ,fund 
342868,audited certik ,
342869,certik saddle sure bout fei,
342870,also kinda useless get audited launching stop think protocol huge tvl undergo periodic security auditing otherwise shit like keep happening main problem everyone trust protocol others already ,stop protocol protocol 
342871,fei audited zeppelin,zeppelin 
342872, ,
342873,last audit july 2021 ,
342874,they're pretty diligent getting audits also making ts dotted internal cross audits,getting 
342876,generally speaking getting constantly audited protocol matter ,protocol 
342877, quantstamp audit fuse,
342878,lotta repays redeems coming,
342879,funny always coincides general dowtrend,
342880,possible get hacked ,
342881,pretty much eyes boomers btc except 2022 currently still long way go outperform traditional assets always everytime stuff like happen feast ,btc 
342883, ,
342884,peckshield wild lol,
342885,can't detect simple math vulnerability code reviews still face post kind stuff,
342886,people talking auditing firms instead pointing correctly ones shit feeding beast audits work auditors liable point shit factory like auditing firms peckshield pessimistic etc ,work 
342887, tetranode what's going ,
342888,lol,
342889,recycle reuse,
342890,seems auditors liable extent part audit agreement that's something protocols negotiate part contract opposed general liability sort thing,contract 
342891,guys sherlock xyz testing theory love team check ,
342892,agreed overall there's lot talks auditing world moving status quo here's pdf invoice good luck ,
342893,lmao,
342894,nah auditors liable people specifically know auditing firms give fuck reputation avoid even represents product launching 6 months due queues firms ,product 
342895,particular reason think projects negotiate sort arrangement seems like helps align incentives properly,
342896,making auditors liable would put 10x premium audit prices would 10x slower,
342897,comment,
342898,think service still desirable maybe every auditor think would good ,
342899,solve anything rather makes extra difficult thing execute downside issue arises time future,time 
342900,would seed stage protocol pay 500k 1m audit raised 1 5m,protocol 
342901,ahahaha uniquely qualified say wouldnt pay 500k,
342902,ive exact situation,
342903,well that's 10x i'm referring hehe,
342904,loss loss projects auditors,
342905,think adequate approach could include insurance pool audit process,
342906,fair point cost time increases think realistically auditing firms would purchase insurance know market like assume bad expensive ,cost time market 
342907,yh thats sherlock,
342908,audit market market auditor customer demand far exceeds supply everywhere queues several months advance curb demand many auditors prepare code test software solutions unfortunately fall far short human eye hand still unscrupulous customers want cut dough soon possible instead making good product ,market market customer product 
342909,protocols buy insurance issue users concerned ones buying insurance,
342911,yeah misspoke meant auditing firms,
342912,one cares see nxm's revenue ,
342913,auditing firms pay 3% premium 100m tvl per year protocol,year protocol 
342914,yeah think correct market seem learning lesson firms like peckshield,market 
342915,want cynical value audit stamp produces revenue without security secondary since exploit 6 12 months road matter already cashed chunk profits,
342916,plebs stop suggesting security practices like first time happened literally retarded sorry rude like every time hack exploit genius starts suggesting holding auditing firms accountable auditor deposits contracts making certik memes etc ,time time 
342917,u fan pessimistic checking ,
342918,bit aggressive sir think concept holding people whose negligence poor work accountable outlandish concept certainly outside crypto plenty damages irl negligence inspectors like answer might seem obvious looking inside protocol building getting audits obvious work end ,bit work protocol work 
342919,know 1 experience terrible,
342920,wrong discuss things 100th time genius ideas thrown around annoying haha 3 much love ,time

342936,fucking gall account,
342937,can't believe peckshield still song dance every hack,
342938,sorry ivangbi that's unoriginal point,
342939,auditing space fundamentally broken static code checks 1 million dollars year please ah think expensive suck sunshine everybody else charging shit buidlers,year 
342940,peckshield provide input help finding issue back guys hacked getting audited ,
342941,particularly that's really point i'm making,
342942,point unique insight post tone deaf matter fact tweets almost every exploit body count well billions point gall,
342943,3 exclamation points jesus christ,
342944,know trying gather data points projects audited bad experience ones better input kind criticism ,data points 
342945,like horse race,
342947,mmmm nothing entices builder flippant braggadocious auditing firm laughing fellow builders i'm definitely going use peckshield future really value professionalism ,
342948,emm hacken isnt bad seems lol,
342949,already costs much though depending clout auditor see bean figures,
342950,whether adding liability would cause 10x debatable can't charge nobody willing pay that's happen there's enough demand willing pay current rates there's incentive anything change,
342951,bean paid 500k audit ,
342952,350k tob 250k halborn least afaic remember voting thingy,
342953,sounds like something would need change insurance end things hard see happens,
342954, ,
342955,wonder insurance costs similarly risky things mature insurance market anyone know ,market 
342956,though maybe good parallels,
342957, ,
342958,yeah one older tob one ,
342960,think fair 40k per week peckshield charges 12k per week,
342962,yeah 10x feasible top tier audit firms one ,
342963,also reference compound's openzeppelin contract 2m quarter 160k per week specification amount auditors people involved ,contract 
342964,fair suppose methinks something tad weird end result buying maybe probably lose money using regardless happens promise hold us part whole liable statement statements would claim much,money

342985,found 2 critical vulnerabilities audit ,
342986,auditor market completely broken going c4 contest way budget timing doesnt work get top tiers way ,market 
342987,smth bad audits one found smth audit covers everything unless mistakes mistakes trivial ye sign,
342988,one pretty trivial skipped lost complete respect also vulnerabilities report clearly automated tool human double checked ,double 
342989,c4 also great confirm super demanding team's tech side,
342990,know audit find everything impossible bug bounties exist ,
342991,definitely can't complain audit quality choose certain cheap auditors,
342992,ah able execute contest yet seem pretty time consuming generate report right ,time 
342993,go rubber stamp audit get rubber stamp audit,
342995,yeap knowing rubber stamp question misleading inform audits ,
342996,toughest part retail users want audits big budget rubber stamp idk maybe better try inform community side ,
342997,getting real audit increasingly difficult scrutiny good firms want deal anons want audit projects think reasonable chance getting hacked top long wait times insane rates mean protocols cannot go real audit yeah get pay people realize audits worth,
342998,that's auditing tho insurance that's different mine field ,
342999,yeap reason auditor market broken basically demands incentives completely align least yet c4 strives good middle ground imho ,market 
343001,helping bridge huge gap ,
343002, want audit projects think reasonable chance getting hacked even mean ,
343003,means speak nobody,
343004,ah clout huh,
343005,weird way phrase though,phrase 
343006,time set clout dao funnel everything,time 
343007,well yeah kind limited resources get two audit requests anon team another aave know one better business well one least likely get hacked,
343008,perhaps earlier comment settling cheap audits problematic,
343009,agreed complicated aspect could apply service needs carry insurance liability reasons medicine least us decent perfect analogy physicians carry malpractice insurance think means they're practicing medicine though ,
343010,great auditors ignore cloutless booked 500 years projects clout course said great business projects look great portfolio also pay nice fees come surprise cheap auditors chosen,
343011,mean i'm blaming teams go cheap audits pointing realities finding auditors current market,market 
343012,ux benefits token transfer triggering contract pattern never really caught defi devs especially newer ones often recognize reentrancy risks ,contract defi 
343013,yeap seems pretty f cked situation theory market balance new auditor firms come lot prices times could taken dev eng could get 10x making token whatevs whats incentive mid tier auditing firm ,market 
343014,clearly still lot rinse repeat ecosystem need ,
343015,aave critical vulnerability went unnoticed year missed multiple audits luckily security researcher reported responsibility collected bounty could let complete protocol drain audits often bullshit ,year bounty protocol

343883,one looks really shows immediately use send tokens n addresses spends lot time talking talking may useful something n addresses,tokens addresses time addresses 
343884,incredibly cool,

343895,hey guys i've made technical guide nft metadata immutability hope insightful ,nft immutability 
343896,appreciate arweave awareness ,
343897,would say missing arweave integration wrt metadata easy use dev tools evm nfties ,
343898,i'm particularly aware average bulk nft drop prepared arweave everything centralised server terms storing assets metadata rules apply easily get files arweave use ardrive arkb cli,
343899,im wondering isnt every nft project using solution like seems like brainer must annoying diffciult,nft 
343900,free like ipfs,ipfs 
343901,costs ar tokens,tokens 
343902,imagine barrier,
343903,yeah getting tokens guess rather cost,tokens 
343904,anyone wants send small amount cover uploads cheap ,
343905,barrier imo temporary nature store everything storage chains least end ,
343906,arweave futureproof thousands miners incentivized store data hundreds years come,data 
343907,take protocol labs ipfs spend lot effort getting projects launch stack even though ipfs mostly server basement protocol labs headquarters,protocol ipfs ipfs protocol 
343908,ipfs masterpiece propaganda everybody thinks store stuff decentralised ,ipfs 
343909,haha yes actually arweave huge amount money flowing ecosystem projects,money 
343910,fund things i'm involved infrastructure makes easier get content onto arweavw chain,fund chain 
343911,makes sense sorry ,
343912,admit expert would like use chance learn possibly help others learn reach conclusions let ask questions,
343913,ok sure happy try answer,
343914,first basics pay x ar store 1 mb file ar put chain used kind basis inflation paid store file give take ,file chain inflation file 
343915,side note arweave also contender eip 4444 proposal store ethereum's history,proposal ethereum 
343916,there's kyve network specialised storing chain history arweave easy access,chain 
343917,inflation fixed supply cost scales based formula takes account cost storage often hdds break,inflation cost cost 
343918,every piece data stored arweave slightly overpays fee goes long term endowment compensate miners,data term 
343919,ok fixed supply pre assigned given host files others paid ar ar paid files replicate fixed supply reserve assigned time based oracle estimated hdd costs ,time oracle 
343920,i'm sure true fixed supply reserved given miner yes generally correct oracle price adjusted update,miner oracle 
343921,yellow paper realm i'll find link,
343922, ,
343923,okay let assume economy tuned last 200 years pay 5 ar today 1mb file live 200 years beyond one gives shit since dead futurechildren problems every bit media weaved bit media data presupposed everyone repin least data though select since weave linear right ,file bit bit data data 
343924,i'm sure get question general idea incentives dictate profitable miners store much weave possible,
343925,called upon bit data recall block can't produce can't mine next block get reward,bit data block block reward 
343926,ok jive built censorship module specifically ,
343927,profitable,
343928,choose propagate content continue blocks content line linked produced ,
343929,profitable paid customer profitable anything else ,customer 
343930,choose serve part weave step able prove recall therefore step mining rewards proof random access algorithm selects block proof miners,mining block proof

343932,hey guys i'm dev yeild aggregator recently gone public allowed post link docs website ,
343933,seems conflicting incentivized host everything regardless evil ,
343934,yes protections beyond nodes filter evil factor,
343936, ,
343937,something make sense still screen content opt repost supposed repost per protocol rules randomly sampled protect kicked miners ,protocol 
343938,two layers architecture miners gateways gateways http endpoints choose bar content,gateways 
343939,miners could example gateways,gateways 
343940,ok many references shepherd actual miners propagating content gateways makes economic sense anyone store everything ,gateways 
343941,saying nft project dont use arweave think makes sense doesnt make nft decentralized ,nft nft 
343943,way yeah mostly trying learn usp,
343944,chose token barrier believe store everything chains last censorship potential still trying wrap head around ,
343945,someone ban fembot begins,
343946,tag admins next time pls ,time 
343947,5 ar payed incentivize storage 200 years happens ar crashes price 50% file stored 100 years instead ,file 
343948,ar recognized currency real world value matter yes entirely possible due price crash lack interest ar goes zero point becomes economically impractical host files due cost much profit even idle machines storage bits weave start disappearing availability becomes low one able continue chain mean store everything chains infeasible ,currency cost chain

344219,hey jacob looking one mind dm ,
344221,biweekly update polkadot ecosystem lot stuff happening ,
344222,could see machine learning predictive modeling useful means expert farming think features like pool age tvl apy relative similar pools would fairly predictive stability pool new high apy compared similar pools would expect apy converge market rate ,machine market 
344223,one main challenges information resource asymmetry participants insider information simply money generates massive randomness model model obviously aware information,money 
344224,see transfer transferfrom methods would say yes,
344225,model would far perfect pretty confident would possible significantly outperform random guessing devil details success effort depends features modeling approach principle much easier forecast future pool apys something like stock returns tho,
344226,would someone make random financial decision tho majority aping larger pool based reputation ,
344227,know lot people give good feedback ,
344228,random guessing referring benchmark model predictions evaluated ultimately hard say good mode without seeing sample predictions ,
344229,pool apy higher order form stock return doubt could learn constants pool formula data give much predictive power,order doubt data

344237,tbh get people find strange actually really easy tell naively whether apy drop example aave launched polygon easy tell 20 30% apy last long since trusted platform battle tested sure enough lasted days apply logic masterchef pools launch see spike apy drops predicting things like quite easy see issue train model,
344238,almost every crypto participant also able tell usually product launches apy high high risk untested lot people want risk time goes product doesnt get hacked apy goes simple prediction yet proves possible predict apy stability,crypto product time product 
344239,literally generalisation financial signals large number participants involved easy prove true empirically look defi launch,defi 
344240,reason simple risk goes time apy goes,time 
344241,i'm saying unpredictable ml model redundant imho defining probabilities 51% 94% make much sense,
344242,exactly think crazy teams set high apy distributions early days launch give majority supply handful degens prepared take risk little likelihood sticking around long term ,term 
344245,whats alternative ml model case would probability describes confidence forecast case llama believe easier use sort model describe relationships variables rather manually handcraft estimates something using model case provides scalability generalization,scalability 
344246,reason defi founders large spike tvl start creates massive bug bounty protocol doesnt get hacked signals everyone protocol trusted trust lasts forever since assertion security smart contracts ,defi bounty protocol protocol trust 
344247,clarify model predict prices apy predicts probability current apy hold small forward looking window,

344262,dont like feature simply dismiss see people finding reasonable using ape pools low probability apy staying level,
344263,see makes lot sense 3% steth staking apy unlikely convex pool gets extra emissions stable apy receives trading fees would drop apy threshold,trading 
344264,i'm trying convince anyone else friendly opinion discussion,
344266,question two members situation involve people 2 sats 1 open discussion person topic problems 2 open discussion inside team part team hope find solution 3 work question means toxic like person racist insult others etc see brought bigger crowd possibly involves voting u always first call smaller group big stakes dao making full public funds whales active contributors etc choose wisely talk easily see someone oriented profit success protocol decide call le dump etc think way u wanna present open discussion always great get feedback fellow contributors u trust 4 public discussion voting people mentioned ens thing example goes category way hope helps wish closure make best situation ,person work person protocol

346318,hi guys made anlysis past ribbon finance liquidity mining univ3 think kinda interesting like 1 guy made 20% rewards cleverly managing liquidity univ3 ,finance liquidity mining liquidity 
346319,revert great analysis post lp mining ribbon well also discussions ct etc,analysis mining 
346320,share link ,
346321,there's discussion zef dan rob abt pool2 uni v3 mining bad idea,mining 
346322,ye let try find,
346323, ,
346324,5 months ago,
346325,yeah saw protocols unleveraged liquidity univ3 days,liquidity 
346326, ,
346327,old fud new fud,fud fud 
346330,sweet viz library use gifs ,
346331,thanks one ,
346332,yeah good one also thought protocol actually gives away tokens small amount liquidity reality turned gained eth rewards dumped side pool ,one protocol tokens liquidity eth 
346333,corner internet praising terra suggest reconsider listen ser lot reasonable people expressing concerns terra months think became scared touch reading crv's risk assessment team report ,
346334, ,
346335,3 man team raise 2m list holy ,
346337,yo de fuk happening w curve ,
346339,bahahahaha,
346340,2 fine,
346342,there's bunch eth anchor polynya good tweets topic,eth 
346343,boomer stable de fuk going michwill sseereeer,
346344,that's happen people understand use buy ust panic sell boomer stables lol ,
346345,where's defi education fund need ,defi fund 
346346,ye seems like panic flee 3crv seems whole,
346347,looked bytecode generated guess statement compiles evm equivalent bne revert multiple would result bne instructions less unexecuted revert instructions could potentially reduce code size slightly compiler naive bytecode reverts revert reasons gas cost essentially,gas cost 
346348,happens noone around bribe gauge,
346349,gauge getting depleted ,
346350,5% apr convex would ppl put stables ,
346351,idk last time checked apys anything fam,time 
346352, ,
346353,bribes peg unless chad like mich tetra vote vecrv cvx,
346354,btw anyone used fixed forex ib stable mim swapper fine works expected funny business ,
346355,think wrong ser take ust3crv pool example bribes 15% weight finally lose peg,
346356,wanna check cannot open page ,
346357,load ser ,
346358,internet ass idk website,
346359,we'll keep chipping away something works reminds digital cash naysayers bitcoin bitcoin indeed possible many years invented novel combination several already existing inventions,cash 
346360,yes situation different stablecoins 'unknown unknown' territory bitcoin lot knowns ,bitcoin 
346362,true knowns found via experiments unknown,
346363,looks like,
346365,makes sense yet time odd thing attempt trying hedge away risk systems dollar side inflation cefi systems issue government instability crypto side instability crypto systems continues issue one perspective crypto extremely volatile relative usd another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto eventually line crossed people see usd volatile relative crypto likely chain assets primary reference point point suddenly gone optimizing crypto based risk needing optimize fiat based risk really difficult balancing act strike properly,time dollar inflation government crypto crypto crypto usd usd crypto usd crypto chain crypto fiat 
346366,honestly need exact code figure thing besides actual revert instruction also returning error string logic far expensive booleans evaluations ,
346367,right happens side branch instruction,
346368,syntactic sugar condition revert reason ,
346369,condition evaluates false execute expensive revert logic including string return etc,
346370,code we're jumping nonzero cost terms size cache locality afaik jump instructions cost differing amounts gas based absolute value program counter increment decrement,cost gas 
346371, another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto we'll dead true beyond shillfluencer narratives even happen bigger things worry happen,usd crypto 
346372, reasonable branch prediction started speculatively executing based assumption require sanity check revert even really lose cache pipeline except exceptional case point already going spend bunch extra resources processing revert ,
346373,well yes change come quickly unexpectedly current paradigm help 80 years mean cannot change extremely rapidly right would cause lot instability though ,
346374,yeah people gonna look ust say algos bad bad may could hardly design better trojan horse fiatcoins various glorified wrappers somehow top 10 3,
346375,think even case non reverts big require still cheaper jumpi costs 10 gas costs 3 gas like said specific example needed,non gas gas 
346376,can't together one instruction though,
346377,simple example 3 operands b c,
346378,b false need c that's jumpi,
346379,b c false still need jumpi,
346380,fact wasting instructions lay like,
346381,compiler generate code goes false exit else b false exit else b c false exit else revert ,exit exit exit 
346382,saved nothing,
346383,case save anything operands already loaded really sequence ands final check value,
346384,would benefit short circuiting end,
346385,suppose written words realized talking revert likely case checking bunch things true one revert case think right short circuiting leads us revert point cares whether wasted gas ands,gas 
346386,said see actual code know whether particular way better worse,

347455,lol stablecoin tied volatile asset go wrong ,stablecoin 
347456,least let's discuss brainstorm ,
347457,account slippage well,
347458,that's effectively fiatcoin steps grow relevant size,
347459, must introduce centralisation brings whole set issues design places inverse contracts trade sufficient size accommodate bitcoin backed stablecoin service current ecosystem occur centralised exchanges cexs ,bitcoin stablecoin 
347460,meh,
347461,suggested stablecoin erc 20 need use wrapped bitcoins like redeem bitcoins erc 20 stablecoins ,stablecoin erc 
347462,check uxd protocol solana ,protocol 
347463,go guys ask money back hopefully get nope ,money 
347464, interesting take crypto stable coin based fiat,coin fiat 
347465,oh sheit first time check website,time 
347466,well given huge demand stablecoins feasible decentralize short derivative contracts business supporting stablecoins dydx offer start small grow ,
347467,like demand huge enough ,
347468,lol gota joke right,
347471,dydx centralized,
347472,claim decentralized eoy whether actually happens debate,
347473,oh maybe thinking another platform,
347474,starting small sure like hayes says small it'll remain unless access cexs,
347475,yes slippage like 100% people redeem time last 10% can't get coz slippage collateral stable coupled derivatives terra part ii also collateralize ,time derivatives 
347476,luna pretty good bet ,
347477,end supply 6t mcap 100m lfg billion still luna holders likely get ,
347478,think interesting asymmetric bet huge upside ,
347479,yeah put like 100 ,
347480,that's fortunes made still gamble course ,
347481,use covid dump example scenario,dump

347545,problem strategy we're assuming funding rates always positive case ,
347546,tread carefully chainlink community deal well constructive criticism understand would trip circuit breaker multiple independent sources would reporting benefit said circuit breaker introduces pushing stale inaccurate data understand relatively sources therefore circuit breaker trips outliers make much sense,data 
347547, ser choice want launch protocol yes one minimum price weird thing idk reasoning stuff works well amantay price deviations comparison maybe share cool research,protocol 
347548,i'm seeing lot discussion around past present furure stablecoins particular decentralized ones tg discord group discussing precise topic would interested get involved looking protocol theorethical discussion around stablecoins ,protocol

347554,uxd kind fund accumulates negative funding rate uses pay funding rates positive ,fund 
347555,circuit breaker literally price 0 10 design chainlink anyone implementing chainlink code know yeah detail that's easy gloss guess alternative breaker letting people get bad incorrect data something goes 99 9% short time period see motivation behind breaker protocols implementing chainlink check price breaker price halt trading freeze assumption something gone horribly wrong simply breaker would lead equally bad outcomes probably,data time trading 
347556,sooo much ctrl f back yam days even go look make actual report even dao sponsor research gib grant potentially ,

347723,that's worst case frax's design guys need imaginative,
347724,yes another thing counting event non pol liquidity withdrawn sold like amo would consistently burn frax keep balance pool within stableswap peg range factor 1500 remaining amount frax left sold minority left compared collateral protocol left hundreds millions locked liquidity uni v3 etc ,event non liquidity protocol liquidity

348488,check latest tho sam wants radically change ,
348489,say radically think people really took mean frax changing everything true making even safer still actually sustainable algorithmic supply frax frax right close 90% backed hard assets enough pol counted cr cover outstanding frax redemptions thing wanted add proposing algorithmic supply backed credit debt addition fxs ,
348490,ah majority amoa stays credit cr ratio let say 10% ,
348491,exactly think got intepretted seigniorage capture fxs totally new stablecoin really case we're trying improve model make something algostables aspire important know frax pretty much perfect peg since launch want get complacent think endgame design forever we're trying improve design algorithmic part supply additionally backed debt ,stablecoin 
348492,ah misread bad ser thx,
348493,see pol total diff total profits bottom right impressive 1 2b ,
348494,pol page yes example cr calculated much conservative manner cr curve amo calculated claims 3crv collateral protocol frax peg breaks cr means curve pool gets emptied frax 88 reality curve amo close 1 1 redemption frax sellers frax amo rebalances actually withstand 1 1 sell offs entire supply 3crv ,protocol 
348495,every amo extremely conservative way calculating cr see look source code onchain since open source frax 0 market operations chain deterministic ,source source market 
348496,another example lending amos similar dai's direct deposit module count cr overcollateralized maker ,
348497,thanks sam helps lot,
348498,count lending amo cr 100% cr rather 150% cr correct way think frax minted places like aave backed 1 debt owed aave protocol 150% eth borrower used borrow frax ,protocol 
348499,cool pol bottom right chart ,
348500,yes bottom right profits still balance sheet see breakdown profits top left investor amo ,
348501,think way governance proposal written confused people going full 100% cr since done community member important know changing fractional algo model making safer keeping things essentially backed debt credit ,governance proposal 
348502,also find breakdowns dune dashboard ,
348503,farms frax apr restake apy otherwise auto compounded rewards ask tokens farms can't easily claim rewards users can't usually hold tokens afaik rebase like ohm one option auto compound curious frax might,tokens tokens 
348504,done analysis protocol profits since last week assume frax still one cash flow generating protocols entire defi space even lower 200m revenue yields think there's many protocols match frax's revenue generation weird see fxs hit hard market rn see dashboard average daily income protocol 317k day that's 115m annual revenue conditions extremely good shape excelling even markets ,analysis protocol cash defi generation market protocol

348508,sure might directional market depth,market 
348509,sad guys next cool team active dao saying anything token ,
348510,tokenomic design ,
348511,ya frax still 37m positive earnings week amazing q profits fall half 1 2b happened frax supply ig multisig fully controls profits fund,fund 
348512,luna ust made curve wars ended,
348513,btw profits 1 2b think mean frax supply 1 2b profits always 200m sitting around 115m lot technically lower ,
348514,yes profits held investor amos like vlcvx places yes treasury msig controlled fxs governance votes ,governance 
348515,money market product increasing cr ratio right ,money market product 
348516,like tradfi lingo yes think that's somewhat accurate think accurate say traditional fractional reserve bank illiquid debt fxs backing algorithmic supply frax aka liabilities bank ,think 
348517,oic grant total showed 1 2b accrued profits shows 40m see numbers refer thanks ,
348518, samkazemian fpi partial algoritmic new model cr 100% ,
348519,115 annualized case 4o accrued far guessing,
348520,1 2b total supply frax little confusing show agree profits accumulated balance sheet 40m correctly pointed ,
348521,correct ,
348522,fpi 100% cr new peg totally different stablecoin balance sheet 100% cr like frax started even conservative opinion fpi peg even harder keep dollar peg since pegged cpi thus inflation resistant ,stablecoin dollar inflation 
348523,current fpi cr indeed 100% right ,
348524, zeframl big pp,
348525,wrong 1 484b frax circ supply ,
348526,ya right front end clearly show 1 485b frax dashboard ,
348527,think main question arw trying understand backing 1 484b supply godefi right ,
348528,acquired profits frax product generating,product 
348529,cr ratio becomes 100% fxs token accrual value frax demand ,
348530,hard assets like usdc deployed curve pool technically 3crv lp tokens specific lending amos also known overcollateralized loans pol uniswap amos etc ,usdc 
348531,1 2b related supply directly right q whatever exactly fell 2 4b 1 2b happened frax supply guess amos could raised cr try reduce supply idk fast works,
348532,another product introduced ecosystem generate profits protocol ,product protocol 
348533,means frax generating weeks billions ,
348534,everything collapsed hey still generating millions that's bottom sky limit products solutions introduced ,
348535,maybe highest day profit 105m,
348536,indeed ,
348537,yes amazing frax still made 35m week ,
348538,frax also broken ,
348539,actually regulate inflation fxs stake holders sure standing,inflation stake 
348540,take break,
348541,read 100 msgs let's talk spaces tonight,

348605,correct reasons,
348606, samkazemian describe scenario curve pool balance ,
348609,tl dr deflation comes first hyperinflation later ,
348610,currently assuming smart contract exploits tether usdc dai depeg possible way cr 88 75% protocol controls enough pol one 3 stablecoins permanently depegs though ya imbalanced additionally low enough cr curve pool could indeed unbalanced sell pressure frax large enough overwhelm protocol controlled liquidity that's frax conservative algorithmic supply cannot happen levels especially near 90% cr ,contract protocol protocol liquidity

348615, bout3fiddy fair compare volumes last days given chunk volume probably people exiting entering usdt panic arbitrage lot ust pool shenanigans sure,usdt 
348616,basically yes probably whats happening worth watch though rewatching,
348617,thanks clarifying 1 200m frax sent pool burn 200m tokens sent pools normally means sold burned right gathered answer amos controlled large frax reserves minted received collateral past frax amos able later burn right 2 amos get minted frax minted borrowed frax needs go users deposit collateral way users deposit collateral given frax rewards amos use collateral mint frax control ,tokens 
348618,1 correct 2 frax minted lending amos even curve amo algorithmic frax supply similar dai mints dai thin air although that's kind extreme way put aave without cdps required generate ,
348619,wrong course definitely unfair compare volumes there's form level playing field guess going get bit interesting watch ,bit 
348620,btw weird balanced yet,
348621,maybe cause dai supply shrinking general,
348623,well value quite high means balancing pool take time well values slow depegs also slow repegs ,time 
348624,'bonus slippage' one gets reduces increasing mean solutions problem ,
348625,simple public good stable coin pay fees profit accumulate collateral simple system eth backing fees reduced supersafe collateral ratio threshold like 1000% cheaper fees higher collateral ratio competitor public good stablecoin clear competitive edge also less risk factors governance centralized assets collateral higher collateral ratio transparent simple data health system,coin system eth stablecoin governance data system

348748,well maybe,
348749,3 14 people still think failed stablecoin lol,stablecoin 
348750,understanding stablecoin number go yea ppl would think rai failed,stablecoin 
348751,would argue possibility number go small price pay keeping collateral pristine worry much fragility peg,

348764,rebranding stablecoins 1 xyz bad marketing point,
348765,nfts priced eth,eth 
348766,nfts 1 10 mcap stablecoins,
348767,i'm curious though practical difference rebasing token setting aside whether believe ponzi esque whatever tweaking example bit token demand token supply token trades target price rebase rate goes positive eventually disincentivize holding minting token token demand token supply token trades target price rebase rate goes negative eventually incentivize holding burning token supply there's significant flaw dis incentives work far allowing price stay redemption target price normal pretty similar ,bit work 
348768,rebase exactly controlled controller uses rates would mechanical difference,
348769,rebasing annoying bc breaks lot interior stuff like theory could add negative rates dai reducing people's dai balances wallet yea that's kinda annoying,
348770,suppose exactly actually changing people's wallet balances internal redemption price rai uses price debt e g determine much borrow get liquidated ,wallet e g 
348772,jfc like revisit 2016 nubits chat,

348792,talking metamask integration main problem solve would make events understandable people,
348793,get wrong interesting problem solve,
348794,yeah thats probably problem lot bigger scope,
348795,protocols like uniswap barely emit enough events get,
348796,also perfect security purposes since could still frontrun state change lot simulation actual execution,state 
348797,sure ever solution understanding malicious contract's state change emit fake events misleading state transitions kinds crap figured would better exclude scope,contract state state

348817,food thought algo stable coin discussion anyone tried banging couple gans goals create break pegged token la 2019 article made noise 3 years ago roughly concept would create multi agent system similar enough open market blockchain environment useful spit lots training data gans attack ad infinitum cost function create stable peg much easier said done given size pot cost large algo stable failures ust think lab would tossing brains compute opportunity ,coin system market blockchain data cost function pot 
348818,many long tails would project need resist would considered battle tested ,

348937,frax uses 88% cr 150% like dai what's tl dr summary else differently 100% cr important thing frax well e g 12% 100 88 faster growth somehow leveraged multiple 12% looked docs paragraph summary points would really valuable thanks ,g points 
348938,tried poking around code ,
348939,hoping,
348940,100% algo stable anymore lowkey maker copy ,
348941,dai use e g 150% 100% edit what's mechanism frax work well 100% 100% ,e g mechanism work 
348942,question ,
348943,100% there's much left incentivize liquidators account sudden price movements,
348944,100% what's mechanism offset problem ,mechanism 
348945,liquidation,
348946,redeem frax get usdc fxs,
348947,updated q ,
348948,guess 88% cr get 88c usdc 12c fxs per frax redeemed iirc,
348949,zhongfu already responded ,
348950,dai frax quite different work anyway can't quite compare crs directly,work 
348951,correct,
348952,ok right btw gets things depositing collateral borrower gets cases e g staking fxs frax locking fxs frax anything else mention top level summary mere mortals ,g 
348953,dai backed different assets backed usdc lower collateral ratio,
348954,redeem 1 frax anyone hold directly frax website,
348955,receive 0 88c 0 11x worth frax think theres small redemption fee iirc something half percent range ,
348956,dai requires minters hold assets vaults back dai gets minted value falls cr assets get liquidated frax takes appropriate amounts usdc fxs gives frax usdc fxs really way dai,usdc 
348957,that's much understand cuz playing around much,
348958,probably find frax eg staking stuff incentivizing liquidity docs tho,liquidity 
348959,able clarify 2nd paragraph it'd great,
348960,uhhhhhh guess usdc fxs belongs protocol necessarily able get back ratio usdc fxs choose redeem frax later,protocol 
348961,e g cr drops get less usdc fxs,e g 
348962, da,
348963,oic well explained,
348964,1 clarify one please 200m frax sold curve pool amo burn 200m frax 200m sold burned mean s1 different 200m burned 200m sent sold curve pool message ,
348965,sers basics please find docs read sam messages ctrl f chat questions specific basic sorry flooding bit w normal things ,bit 
348966, ,
348967,yup thanks much ,
348968,np tbh find correct misconceptions important aspects product asking basic questions like backs frax first agreed pol aka grant total profit 1 2b mentioned screenshot said supply supply led good clarifications around q tokens sent simultaneously burned seems generally interesting spot docs fair enough moved q frax channel ty ,product tokens channel 
348969,fair open ended question channel seems broader appropriate would grow faster launched today time dai frax edit assuming know ,channel time know 
348970,commented someone earlier generally stablecoins guess suffers demand supply problem launched volatile week eth high ups downs price demonstrated ability keep peg range problem there's demand stablecoin also stress testing peg limited advantage low cap thus low circulating supply seen project coming forward trust float yet afaik,eth stablecoin trust 
348971,imo answer question would likely speculative could say since need less per frax minted vs dai given amount capital able get frax could also say since frax concept less battle tested since we're assuming situation launched users would skeptical knows ,
348972,could also say dai utilizes volatile collateral providing speculative use case stablecoin rather using stable amos,stablecoin 
348973,good meant assuming know know they're relaunched whatever explanation patches scenario,
348974,idk imo makes much sense asking discovered apples oranges today would people prefer maybe someone else better response question,
348975,fair answer oranges vs apples might they'd like they've around long also analogy seems bit faulty stable coin q least math economic reasons work highlight strengths think market game theory liquidity etc think good exercise answers given far may best anyone that's ty,bit coin market liquidity 
348976,point q anyone possibly thinking novel stablecoin mechanics consider aspects embrace dai frax,stablecoin

350159,lending protocols strength leveraged positions cause yield endogenous composability yield sourced outside,
350160,prob less 9m due liquidation penalty buffer,
350161,answer prob less 6,
350162,give example folding strategy makes use exogenous yield efficient way ,
350163,sure let's take example deposit 1k steth mint 5k eth swap 5k eth steth 2 actions addliquidity curve pool steth stecrv addliquidity stake covex stecrv staked convex position,eth eth stake 
350164,efficient leverage example effectively using staked convex position collateral eth short risk much higher since dealing protocols leverage ,
350165,kinda add risk even small yield ,
350166,liquidation conditions much less clear would argue derivatives made derivatives much less liquid costly close positions ,derivatives derivatives 
350167,almost yield defi comes people paying premium either swap build leveraged position ,defi 
350168,case convex allows unwrap position w extra conditions add complexity adds small gas overhead,gas 
350169, euler mab evaluate risks 2 following events 1 unwrap convex position curve pool token 2 remove liquidity curve stecrv pool,liquidity 
350170,efficient collateral need put first step less u would kinds chain borrowing,chain

351331,maybe would less mental gymnastics certain people fool thinking crypto stock market 100% brockshane ,crypto market 
351332,im worried ipo web2 market works clear business makes money shares go value business works general im wondering web3 models end day they're businesses need sustain selling tokens get lots money token may become illiquid eventually least money selling nfts sold product get there's much random stuff like poap 1000 others get poap raised 10m example guess hope eventually becomes profitable somehow big enough nothing grants funding either,market money tokens money money product 
351333, unprofitable still dont understand trying get ok,
351334,pretty sure nowadays shares go value businesses may make money future ,money 
351335,post insinuate uber sort exception wrt profitability nothing sort,
351336,care less uber that's irrelevant,
351337,sources understand bancor fell behind uniswap sushiswap despite ample capital tech googling brings old article 2019,

351339,tl dr lucky,
351340,1000s profitable public companies uber extreme end spectrum real point could chosen profitable long time ago revenue matters cursory glance business outside like pretty meaningless,time 
351341,one reasons forced bnt people swaps believe,
351342,end spectrum uber also insane amount invested tho magic leap example raised 3 5 billion without working product ,product 
351343,magicleap also crazy story,
351344,like understand goal make money following closely assume huge l,money 
351345,doesnt tell whole bunch web3 startups,
351346,nice interesting though ,
351347,raised 500 mil last year ,year 
351348,whatever ls really seem factor investors ,
351349,amazon wasnt proftiable like 20 years chose many companies something basically public companies common good revenue likely could profitable wanted vast majority ,
351350,vast majority profitable ,
351351,part one fixed cost would profitable certain size grew enough would market leader think one partly choice ,cost market 
351352,look p 500 go one one check profits ,
351353,reinvesting profits growth makes lot sense,
351354,dig company's financial statements know strategy know what's going ,
351355,sp500 vast majority public companies ,
351356,think reinvest would failed verified ,
351357,mean turn around that's good far 3 5b invested extra 500m isnt crazy amounts crazy company could raise much sort product market fit highly unusual point company invested billions r 8 years effort,product market 
351358,really relevant anything want look regular businesses operate,
351359,lol,
351360,amazon 8 years ago profitable brings us back beginning amazon business delivering rapid revenue growth accumulating surplus cash profits every penny cash ploughed back expanding business given business runs permanently loss profits already spent making new businesses ,cash cash 
351361,still curious original question resources helpful,
351362,certain irony watching discussion starts disagreeing essentially there's equation profitability circle back less conclusion digress,
351363,companies raised billions last years investors significant amount revenue justify probably except epic even sustainable revenue model ,
351364,eventual profitability important that's businesses valued short term speculation impact long term hold water revenue metrics business extremely important looking numbers outside provides little insight amount profit company generate next 20 years,term term 
351365,course,
351366,true though bets like magicleap extreme exceptions market flowing cash past years saying 70b valuation uber made sense overall non web3 businesses pretty easy understand,market cash non 
351367,important resist conflating businesses different stages different players involved different incentives ,
351368,differences need explained,
351369,early stage startups get 20m valuations can't exit reason valuation may make sense 10% chance becoming worth 1b 50x return investment highly profitable ofc real numbers different might 0 1% chance bet make sense ev,
351370,wework losing billions year even scandal still managed raise like 15 billions private funding recently looking articulate raised around 1 5 billion 80 million revenue ,year 
351371,despite hand wringing rich understanding vc firms lose money average yeah super high risk ,money average 
351372,coworking businesses extremely extremely profitable high front costs despite taking massive hit 50b expected valuation years back super good businesses worth 10b reason,
351373,high risk high reward good vc needs return 3x capital invested many unprofitable long term angels well recent times many likely profitable due overinflated paper valuations ya longer term p500 much safer bet,reward term term 
351374,goes web3 startups tonne backed vc funds understandable alchemy infura charge monthly fee nansen icy tools charge monthly fee metamask takes big cut swaps opensea looksrare take 2 2 5% trades binance coinbase make money trades nft creators make money selling nfts art access games tokens world seems many good model v small minority pretty understandable sustainable there's tonne others seem totally wild dont get keep going,money nft money tokens

351399,speculation question speculated speculating future revenue based fundamentals therefore dividend growth decline speculating twitter shills better worse job bringing greater fools asset ,twitter 
351400,fed macro factors still fundamentals since asset holding company project working vacuum,
351401,saying one way speculation better obviously profitable best would argue lot easier speculate profitably based objective measurable facts data long term,data term

352036,exactly token stays stable token b goes 50% u lose 2% il delta neutral hedged kinda goes parabolic though,token 
352037,make sure solidity compiler introduce new bugs versions,solidity 
352038,long tail assets experience harder il even worse though ,
352039,yeah bad dynamically increase decrease short keep il,
352040,sure anything yielding less 25 30% becomes tricky manage,
352041,i've trying think way euler costly individual basis pooled short position dynamically updated debt ,
352042,might economical,
352043,user would get share debt pool position uniswap changes need repay debt asset borrow asset b ,
352044,could even without following uni position independently farming position something like token drops 50% increase short 10% token pums 50% decrease short 10% rough numbers also providing ready strategy might dilute yields much ,

352481, found one,
352486,according discord supposed life people sneaked testing phase,
352487,others claimed straight via smart contract although straight forward,contract 
352488, ,
352489,someone wants look almost 1400 people claimed already,
352490,check medium ,
352491,using abi using example remix,
352492,need merkle proof,proof 
352493,right get,
352494,interacting contract,contract 
352495,write delegate maybe ,
352496,need dev guide us ,
352497,yes already read articles easy want understand formulas remember well valid univ3 curves,
352498,frontend loaded claim 1 wallets,
352499,claim op via contract ,contract 
352500,removed ton sybills mine although people claiming clearly multiple wallets,
352501,possible yes,
352502,anyone knows speed transaction metamask seem allow increase gas optimism,transaction gas 
352503,whats claim link see coming soon,
352504,change rpc public one infura,
352507,know might sound like noob terms understanding technical weeds definitly could elaborate ,
352508,yeah main thing get merkle proof provide claim function anyone knows ,proof function 
352509, ,
352510,contract unverified tho,contract 
352511,prob requires front end interaction correct ,
352512,need able interact contract abi directly without using etherscan,contract etherscan 
352513,anyone contract address ,contract address 
352514, ,
352515,claim still working ,
352517,rats,
352518,correct,
352519,would recommend remix ,
352520,hey guys anyone maybe spare tickets ethcc paris ,
352522,look actual data see research guillaume lambert realize average returns approximately 0% risk high ,data 
352525,use ctrl f ban ,
352526,iteract,
352527,unverified contracts ,
352528,op airdrop,
352529,announced 30 minutes ago,
352530,yeah understand someone saying mm active liquity providers univ3 works much better univ2 backtest well true stated tweet well delta positive position understand comparison respect holding 2 tokens instead lping,tokens 
352531,uni v3 best jit liquidity providers ones make meaningful returns see research bancor ,liquidity 
352532,jit definition ,
352533,time liquidity providers think people hyperconcentrating liquidity providing one block see big trade coming mempool,time liquidity liquidity block 
352534, note current version starkgate alpha support browser use chrome connect joke,
352535,basically extracting value legit liquidity providers think someone dex conference amsterdam analyzed volumes 30% total fees captured jit liquidity providers anyway trying build amm efficient lps swaap ,liquidity conference liquidity 
352536,never thought brilliant,
352537,give check insane sum normal user advantage providing liquidity v3 curve instead univ2 average really see advantage conversation,liquidity average 
352538,non stable pairs least,non 
352539,claim op ,
352540,personally lping v2 rewards year like clear txs onchain claim rewards etc,year 
352541,muted month ,
352542,normal user provide liquidity current amms non stable pair would rather stake tokens provide liquidity lending pools current return risk ratio profile amms bad unless add liquidity mining incentives top ponzinomics understand product fails deliver adequate returns lps really want lp professional active market maker would definitely go v2 style amms ,liquidity tokens liquidity liquidity mining product market 
352543,v3 offers called clm concentrated liquidity managers like arrakis gamma strategies manage v3 position crunched data seems overperform liquidity providers see amber report ,liquidity data liquidity 
352545,anyone experience aware someone able wrap nft collection owners bridge nft differing chains ,nft nft 
352546,essence big issue amms explains strategies good return risk profile perform two things time price discovery identifying right price asset market making providing liquidity asset pair make efficient fact things time greatest strenghth able list token without relying external data also greatest weakness pay arbitrageurs update prices pools value extracted basically impermanent loss ,time market liquidity time data 
352553,send weird op claim links redacting everything dumb,
352554,lol ok,
352555,might correct safu risking makes sense sowwy socket,
352562,yea totally understand,
352563,makes perfect sense,
352564,safu better rekt,rekt 
352565,ivan degen,
352567,market maker tradfi cefi strategy amm like expect amm rely external data feeds advanced algorithms strategies actually yield consistent returns lps building ,market data 
352568,apps optimism lagging af jesus ,
352569,saw github claimming op think wait op team,
352570,op network lagging like hell ,
352571,airdrop,
352572,metamask uni 1inch lagging,
352573,interface hordes hitting contract directly,interface contract 
352574,still can't figure rip,
352575,rpc getting hammered,
352576,hopefully well paid vc backed devs fair share valley high profile start ups exposure know scale aws infra,know 
352577,use vc money something good,money 
352578, actually works fam tested,
352579,ok fine adrian confirmed otherwise email government,government 
352580,aaaaaaaaaaaaaa,
352581,sent like 10min ago want keep unless someone checked leaking alpha ,
352582,know know thanks vaibhavchellani ,
352583,thanks getting banned jail,
352584,safu,
352585,oh fk u changed ur name jfc,
352586,recognize u haha,
352590,anyone private op rpc lagging like hell ankr seems skipped,
352591,u make alchemy,
352592, ,
352593,create alchemy account get one free worked like charm,
352594, ,
352595,fuck,
352596,87c transaction op,transaction 
352597,gives uni airdrop vibes,airdrop 
352598,gross 1000 gwei day,
352599,back day i've found somewhat surprisingly heaps uni tokens airdropped way airdrop sold 30 per uni something,tokens airdrop 
352600,regrets,
352601, ,
352602,make memes cause can't use network,
352610,hope ivan let mess happen w gear,
352611,think lot ppl talk il stable pairs plus there's long term data looks multiple cycles determine return correlated assets like eth wbtc know uni v3 position made 1% return yesterday past 4 days though due mostly eth dumping pumping still better imo long term holding btc eth next bullrun dominance starts dropping ,term data eth dumping term btc eth 
352612,lobster semi private rpc share dms open,
352613,tried testnet works well offering free integration existing nft project wanting go multichain ,testnet nft 
352614,ok calculate point say finding interesting part like options iv get breakeven multiplying 1 sqrt 365 price try beat implied realized movement right amm lp iv adjust automatically bc receive higher volatility also consequence higher swap fees calculate point considering costant ratio swapfees iv simulate worth partecipate liquidity provider imagine market adapt statistical aebittage actually make money lp incentivized like sushi dexes farm token think risk farming actually low enough terms rug exploit,liquidity market money token 
352615,sign one alchemy ,
352616,low number transactions cool use free one ,transactions 
352617,would love currently stuck missing flight convinient,
352618,lobs created one please share via dm,
352619,im confused cant go website type email pick password get free rpc provide,type

352621,talking telegram use literal device sign service,
352622,spin machine ,machine 
352623,sign one alchemy,
352624,read suggestion ,
352625,ever spin rpc machine ,machine 
352628,infura also rpc provider free tier ,
352630,literally go link make account give rpc url use,
352631,takes like 30 seconds,
352632,need credit card details,
352633, get,
352635,1 alchemix v2 yet support small screens please get larger screen resize browser window 2 account cause use different provider private rpcs want create account spin vm ,
352636,alchemy,
352637,vm,
352638,ohh tried using infura told add credit card tho,
352639,mayen hurry read properly ,
352640,transaction go sign create new app choose network optimism name give something want optimism mainnet click view keys able see https link copy link metamask change rpc endpoint url one copied faster public rpc slow right,transaction mainnet 
352641, ,
352642,maybe changed cc attached account use infura backup rpc,
352643,help,
352644,mmmm,
352645,know what's faster sharing,
352646,plus sharing caring,
352647,imagine might tightened things,
352648,serrrrr,
352649,free tier,
352650,barely,
352651,actually faster people rightly expose rpc endpoints public internet,
352652,enough request,
352653, ,
352654,dmed u one ser dont share,
352655,seconds shared,
352656, exposed rpc endpoints public internet lost 5 figures ask nothing ,
352657, ,
352659,oh wow,
352660,hard someone shares community ,
352661,well yes endpoint going pretty much worthless today,
352662,go ahead use free requests lobsters,
352663,change want see world,
352664,excellent work,work 
352665,happend alot ppl used pay ,
352666,system key loaded someone able ask submit transaction key ,system key transaction key 
352667,within 2 minutes open might add ,
352668,like literally opened port opened log watched say executing eth sendtransaction ,eth 
352669,expensive lesson,
352670,modern ethereum clients even capability anymore type issue,ethereum type 
352671,actually bit risky part agencies like fbi investigate crypto scam chase rpc callers get data centralised node providers like alchemy told founder top 100 coin something privacy ,crypto data node coin 
352672,mean tons reasons share,
352673,guys free account helping lobster navigate latency heavy times ,
352674,want avoid using things like give individual users api key,key 
352675,providing liquidity volatile pool share fees farming rewards heavily inflated token defi 2 0 doubled stack eth past 8 months risk il diminishing returns growing pool chasing yield always direct claim eth contract level without depending dao vote multisig release funds sure eth price might tank always access underlying eth eth stack grows fees like irl reward token created expressly farming may may lasting value future depending governance revenue intent ability founders community strength million factors ,liquidity defi eth eth contract dao eth eth reward governance 
352676,ribbon dopex another structured product ,product 
352677,true although compute il even liquidity pools exist v2 like amms using tool instance weth wbtc pair impermanent loss reached 47 9% 01 01 16 01 05 22 means need 10 55% apy break even today apy uni v2 2 6%,liquidity 
352678,serious question anyone know optimism decided airdrop launch rather bad market seem like huge urgency wait ,airdrop market 
352679,mean race market share atm,market 
352680,clearly wasnt working competing alt l1s without ability brrrr,alt 
352681,true never done liquidity funds usually price amm positions like options essentially hedge buying another option see crab strategy opyn instance usually payoff negative cumulate positive times especially pool incentivized mean long run farming opportunities disappear tokens accrue much value market starting realize ,liquidity tokens market 
352682,better launch token bear market community green time instead red fudding ,bear market time 
352683,that's super interesting point actually true uponly launch bottom,
352684,since raising money valuation irrelevant,money 
352685,depends goals project look pump price well that's pospone launch ideal better market conditions ,pump market 
352687,yeah really matters actually trying ico raise money obviously valuation matters,ico money 
352688,backwards getting money token matters theoretically quite bit,money 
352689, ,
352690,liquidate though going give x% supply away really matter price,
352691,total supply 4ish billion right even price drop still like 5b mc,
352692,can't liquidate anything without counterparty really tangible 5b see luna,
352696,could suggest find abi unverified contract ,contract 
352697,speaking univ2 curve example right provide liquidity univ2 incentivzed eth usdc pool instance what's way calcultae right options straddle position proxy hedge il moreover perpetual option market maybe ftx idea ,liquidity market 
352698,would elaborate ,
352699,beleive could use squeeth theory also heard appears expensive practically useful,
352700,said eth usd pool curve e g without btc hedging would probably easy uni2 sushi,eth usd e g btc hedging 
352701, squeeth historical daily funding 0 32% like that's per day ,
352702,almost like uniswap lping ev something,
352703,squeet ,
352704,squeeth yeah squared eth option price designed follow eth squared theoretically good hedge constant product invariants expensive though,eth eth product 
352705,quite interesting cheap lps willing sell vol think big part lps see way take profits dca assets similar lot people use ribbon vaults maybe alternative ways sell vol like primitive finance makes market efficient unsure though,dca finance market 
352706,think im optimistic panoptic finance approach,finance 
352707,anyone ambire kcc gone ,
352708, ivogeorgiev guess ,
352709,realized posted trying post frens group lol,
352710,pls ser use ,
352711,calculating weth btc pair years uniswap existed also use uni v3 used v2 much since v3 came 17% today uni v3 pair though that's using defi llama dashboard would bet higher reality would check fees vs liquidity past 24hrs sure ,btc defi liquidity 
352713,impermanent loss calculate since depends following variables none related pool prices weth wbtc beginning period prices weth wbtc end period,
352714,v3 yield essentially depends ability use right ranges liquidity average liquidity providers neutral negative payoff mean profit congrats ,liquidity liquidity 
352715,average 90% ppl prob lose money investing crypto ,money crypto 
352716,anyone know tool website lets see token amounts wallet certain time back history say want know contents jan 1 2021,wallet time

352746,people think future going better past otherwise fucked ,
352747,uniswap document goes contracts functions know thorough test suite recall something like give example thinking something like rai's geb outline contracts work words specifying expectations function,function 
352748,example ens investors centralization holders debts governance protocol constant revenue name fees ,governance protocol

352770,that's roughly dependent loan value,
352771,yeah right smaller ltv deposited amount less likely get liquadated,
352772,u turbo stack long increases ltv extra maths see u get fully liquidate inclusive loan lolo,
352773,3 5 coinbase ,
352782,luck getting transfer coinbase sent test transactions nothing showing wallet yet ,transactions wallet 
352783,metamask hardly even recognizes op network let alone lets anything good first day op,
352784,used alchemy rpc still bitch,
352785,problems claiming sending across wallets transfers coinbase seem delayed,
352786,ok using one ,
352787,deposit coinbase directly optimism network ,
352788,sent one exchanges claiming got coins able withdraw though see op tradable coinbase get,
352789,sign alchemy get optimism rpc,

352814,wonder part liquidity incentive program better fine print,liquidity 
352815,general stuff fei ondo think frax ondo,
352816,ondo yes terms communicated,
352818,fact dump token end day interesting,
352819,layer top anchor ,
352822,follow case carefully users lose lot money vaults ,money 
352825,match side gib shitcoin gib stablecoin end day loan turns less usd provided make sure match back keep stablecoin issuance par,stablecoin usd 
352826,logical right aint taking shitcoin risk cause would market maker instead r neutral position value expense ur token dumps ,market token 
352828,ondo finance fei collaborating provide liquidity service gro protocol looking etherscan seems somewhere 117 days ago 97 days ago ended 1 18m tokens 30% circulating supply today dumped uniswap without knowing details would calling ondo finance's management treasury question gro protocol ,finance liquidity protocol etherscan tokens finance protocol 
352830,gro layer curve convex providing stablecoin vault employed strategies protocols past ,stablecoin 
352833,well ondo one side provides stables loses volatile asset drops 90% ,
352834,junior side's risk ,
352836,gro yield aggregator indeed people using junior tranche vault product lost funds due exposure ust 3crv curve pool whilst senior pwrd product remained protected earning interest designed ,product product

352839,guess 90% protection work shitcoin liquidity outside ondo's market actually 90% protection ondo's tranchess laas separate products afak,protection work liquidity market protection 
352841,tbh stated projects openly exactly reason gearbox members far move forward ondo risk downside fei ondo dumping pretty big see gro apy ask small much smaller retail would want size big ye clause catch,
352842,clauses public find details docs rebalancing operations excess liquidity end contract ,liquidity contract 
352843,nice goodbye community contract ends ,contract 
352844,sure mean believe ondo mercenary pay x provide liquidity also add shitcoins shitcoins totally reasonable clear books,liquidity 
352845,usually contract gets renewed,contract

352847,maturity renew lessen impact however ngl rough,
352849,yeah seems better run mill liquidity program,liquidity 
352850,posturing mercenaries bad we're better even skin deep,
352851,tbf im guessing gro option renew contract could've alleviated problem sense fei ondo multiple ways preventing dump either otc deals,contract dump 
352852,mercs dump relentlessly,
352853,sounds like mercenary steps,
352854,least know counter party right right ,
352855,worse singular party dump everything single go without qualms,
352856, zomg dirty token cleaning books ,
352857,never mind fact dirty tokens thing makes relevant,tokens 
352858,talks can't say exactly happened speculate perhaps they've cleared gro perhaps definitely bad look ondo 100% agree ,

355026,wow wow,
355027, ,
355028,discovering would super easy hindsight huge token holder eoa,
355029,check mainnet activity realize gnosis safe,
355030,contracts created address different chains completely different code result completely different owners possible see attacks using vector future ,address 
355031,may thought need access private key original creator eoa case create use current nonce address factory compute address multisig,address address 
355035,want open worms really exploit address one chain mean rights every chain ,chain chain

355685,hi trying replicate numbers total projected yield apy calculation ribbon finance anyone tried able achieve numbers getting higher numbers reason using formulas performance yield provided website thanks advance ,finance 
355686,yield dovs yield trading one direction goes far losing,trading 
355687,cool thank ser noob question mind let's say want chain analysis iterating contract deployments extracting cfgs wrote code ropstein using erigon wanted scale mainnet archive using geth would rewrite lot code ,chain analysis contract mainnet 
355688,i'm sure exactly erigon works worried would start scratch wanted scale,
355689,mainnet disk requirements much bigger,mainnet 
355690,hm mean apy number shown ribbon misstatement projected profit calculated based covered call strategy ,
355691,that's fine concerned dev time code reuse,time 
355692,apy projected based premium collected last 4 weeks assuming options expire money options expire itm see loss apy see historical chart performed,money 
355693,gotcha makes sense sorry potentially stupid question option premium based certain parameters volatality perceived risk ribbon charge pre set percentage 1% 2% wasnt able verify premium something auction price found eth covered calls sure helps,eth 
355694,options strike price set distance 10% price premium determined auctioning options,
355695,usually option pricing calculated using black scholes function certain parameters e expiry strike price spot price risk free rate implied volatility estimation volatile case ribbon dovs trade actually made trough auction premium collected,e

355700,thx 4 sharing,
355701,thx docs quite well written refreshingly different gitbook copypasta lots thoughtful considerations design ,
355702,many validators exit per day unlock happens many eth unlocked daily ,eth 
355703,still undetermined i'd love hear others heard withdrawal queue currently designed last many months 3,
355704,based modeling done projecting validator key rotation needs,
355705,3 conservative number remember i've heard 6 months 1yr thrown around casually,
355706,3 validator 96 eth day ,eth 
355707,think possible devs staker side client teams ef achieve spec,
355708,know number eth,eth 
355709,like queue full perpetually many months normal conditions currently designed meaning new withdrawals wait least long cooldown period unless redesign occurs might happen know public start discussing merge,
355710,find plz share around various docs forums remember want misquoting,
355711,mean timing merge ,
355712,little time may get schedule may always,time 
355713,haha think dm lido chat accidentally got banned sent source think answers question,source

355715,900 validators day memory exit queue entry queue numbers,exit entry 
355716,yeah correct,
355717,know cfg guess want extract info deployments depends going make using standard interfaces might work reading directly erigon db definitely different clients use different db formats solutions,
355718,lido devs coredev working various ways reduce queue former different schemes obviate need regular key rotation,
355719,latter ways make queue larger without sacrificing security economic guarantees,
355720,that's minimum goes minimum based active validators,
355721, ,
355722,remember exact number extrapolating existing staker key rotation needs queue could full quite awhile withdrawals enabled,
355723,1k rightnow remember exact number,
355724,nice thx looking something like,
355725,partial withdrawals likely alleviate stress exit queue well ,exit

355995,oh see block reward line,block reward 
355996,0 09 priority fee thanks ,
355997,curious priority fee block reward go away post merge priority fees continue distributed validator assigned block ,block reward block 
355998, specific goes fee recipient necessarily validator ,
355999,attestation proposal rewards get added validator balance priority fee goes fee recipient address,attestation proposal address 
356000,true though id imagine validators greedy regard lol,
356001,yes precisely makes running something like rocketpool bit attractive post merge node operator would earn priority fees,bit node 
356002,get propose block guess lol,block 
356003,running 2 rpl nodes instead 1 solo one would earn 2x priority fees though would rare much could add time,time 
356004,right currently get 1 block ever 4 5 weeks,block 
356005,get 0 09 per 5 weeks thats shabby,
356006,get 0 18 every 5 weeks thats even better,
356008,yeah shabby actually that's like extra 5 9% apr,
356009,also rocketpool team considering lowering barrier entry 50% node supply 16 eth perhaps 25% 8 eth plus 10% equivalent rpl one would go 1 solo 4 rpl nodes,entry node eth eth 
356010,0 09 0 36 eth ,eth 
356011,back napkin math,
356012,makes seem surface anyway attractive,
356013,additional risk rocketpool contract attack surface opposed solo time merge happens fairly well battle tested though major vulnerabilities likely wouldnt seen withdrawals enabled ,contract attack time 
356014, ,
356015,they're planning ways force node operators setting fee recipient rpl fee distributed fairly still consideration since earn least much fees avg running rpl node opposed solo 2 nodes 50% still get 50% 2x fees 100% plus % 50% one solutions would redistribute fees straight back withdrawal address attractive still something considering ,node node address 
356016,damn super ngmi,

356049,help modern robin hood settle better sure otc deal celsius,
356051,meme ok kingdom 3,
356052,lol ftx hate unfounded imo blame poorly managed ust risk celsius deflection makes sense,
356053,seems like hoping depeg wont fall 20 % said breathing room anything else unwind happens way quicker threshold reached ,
356054,agree celsius' behavior egregious musnt forget playing user funds liqing celsius hurts general population 'bad celsius management' story whole ust luna unwind kwon still filthy rich probably,
356055,lol can't believe people bootlicking celsius dude acting like non profit organization needs saved people make mistakes accept consequences poor risk management acting like risk free nobody owes anything seeing uponly mechanics wrong providing tools help bring systemic risk back equilibrium,non organization 
356056,think beautiful see defi wear like whether terra celcius ftx whoever events nature healing need exploits lawsuits perfect space,defi 
356057,none 3 entities mentioned called defi ,defi 
356058, lawsuits perfect space lol,
356059,yes ftx celsius clearly decentralized,
356060,wanna create world ecosystem finance back people literally screened risk taking behavior inherently inevitable space make mistakes people learn hopefully help others repeating mistakes world works literally cannot linear growth undertaking systemic changes,finance

356064,conclusion,
356065,obvious ser,
356066,bag go embrace yolo bag go call gary gensler,
356067,like whether like say anyway personal choice believe full freedom better cause protection always goes wrong,protection 
356068,btw rationale letting take principal still stays barrier curious second take means sell position open market w slippage entailed actually withdraw w slippage ,market 
356069,first yeah basically maintain liquid 3 month 6 month one year markets skip 9 month avoid fracturing liquidity much take falling 9 month gap becomes tradable next quarterly roll second yes correct trading slippage withdrawing ,year liquidity trading 
356070,new 1yr market ser ,market

359803,feeling change,
359804,announcement kiln ropsten rinkeby deprecation time move goerli sepolia ,time 
359805,thought genie came first compared gem,
359806,dev team creators left unknown reasons idk faith side subjectively aware one side kinda arrogant one humble u u ,
359807,vasa,
359808,that's matters,
359809,better question nft avenue short answer dates attached roadmap promising hit targets particular order,nft order 
359810,hmm interesting uni swap acquired aggregator instead building market ,market 
359811,sorry asked wrong group ,
359812,yeah genie feels like public good,
359813,since ,
359814,uniswap labs btw protocol,protocol 
359815,put like genie charge fee basically free use maybe like charity instead since aggregator can't really direct fees uniswap labs either unless uniswap labs built market,market 
359816,stick fee top metamask,
359817,wait fee easily switched probably forget gem ,
359818,old pic still relevant ,
359820,maybe relevant new opensea ,
359821,surprised usdd's marketing capabilities,
359822,guys monsters,
359823, genie mostly lost gem opensea optimized smart contracts making genie less valuable nft market badly visible uptrend genie taking fees genie fired several people team week ago must really good deal uniswap buy great product core team probably 150m ,market product 
359824,find genie raised bootstrapped taking fees maybe actually ran cash,cash 
359825,val would good deal side tbh half gem remember correctly case ggwp scott negotiating,
359826,agree must good deal sides,
359827,funfact genie gem team,
359828,cto others decided leave due unknown reason start gem,
359829, ,
359830,genie wild success closed beta exploded quickly many funds including team frothing invest,
359831,knowledge close round fundraising round put together last fall never closed genie take fees would quite difficult imo overwhelming majority volume routed opensea easy users bypass fee wish use genie identify best price execute marketplace public good sure becomes open credibly neutral tool keen see plays ,
359832,finally nftx uniswap,
359833,gonna tho ,
359834,pretty sure genie already supports nftx ,
359835,assuming lift,
359837, ,
359838,ye nftx team saying genie already support,
359840,dune currently count seaport volume keep mind outdated 15 june,
359841,ge sers decent nft aggregators except genie gems ,nft 
359842,airdropping usdc usdc work ,work 
359843,lans use cash dao,cash 
359844, ,
359845,gib uniswap treasury genie users ,
359846,imo reservoir best positioned aggregator compete w marketplace since native liquidity,liquidity 
359847,looking ones specifically end users ,
359848, credibly neutral operators,
359849, ,
359850,levee built reservoir's orderbook team building full fledge consumer app akin gem genie,
359851,closed round public info whatsoever,
359852,see possible reply right,
359853,mean ,
359854,may 1st close round,
359855, hood protocol run decentralized network open source indexer nodes aggregate chain chain liquidity easy use readily available trust minimized reservoir's aggregated orderbook enables innovation across nft stack novel sources liquidity next generation consumer facing nft products ,protocol source chain chain liquidity trust nft generation nft 
359856, ,
359857,want give disclaimer shill portfolio companies ,
359858,guessing uniswap bought think next big onramp nfts gamefi ,
359859,reservoir portfolio company delphi digital,digital 
359860,always give disclaimers,
359861,hmm there's lot buzzwords lot heavy lifting,
359862,however hope one day ,
359863,whoop bad,
359864,regards nft aggregators suppose neutrality would also operate marketplace,nft 
359865,really weak position negotiate maybe uniswap even saved death considering market conditions deal size easily 50 75m ,market 
359866,anyone could operate said marketplace orderbook persisted arweave indexer node open source effect get permissionless operation aggregator,node source permissionless 
359867,0x nft feature full swap right aggregator ,nft 
359868,understand aggregator valued much dealroom valued around 40m they've developing aggregator since 2012,
359869,unless way monetize better web2 aggregators e commerce,e 
359870,gotta user stickyness team imagine uniswap could copied much less,
359871,users they're airdropping usdc retain,
359872,ye makes sense nft defi audience surprisingly seperated lot nft whales see defi ponzi lot untapped value users convert like pokerstars launching casino ,nft defi nft defi 
359873,bold statement people whose arch nemesis screenshot tool,
359875,i'm speculating must reasons smarter lol,
359876,ye works way well limited sample size defi users ,defi 
359877, nft whales non existing concept whale 5m let say net even liquid worth since like 10 collections items worth enough something point let say 3 top collections got lucky choosing avg one item 40 eth like 50 120 total pieces 50 eth tag literally 6m like 50 punks 50 apes 50 doodles still barely whale fuck nft whale like 10 apes people 5 doodles people dozen punk sers early flippers collectors like singaling literally fixed math sorry,nft non whale eth eth nft whale 
359878,guess move existing audience new product category fees move new audience existing products see value ways plus nfts nice ramp retail tbh,product 
359880,thats like saying scratch offs good entry casino,entry

359883,fixed math sorry,
359885,dunno done maths nft whales hear phrase thrown around lol,nft phrase 
359886, lot nft whales see defi ponzi irony ,nft defi 
359887,maybe build speculative value opensea worth ,
359888,tbh need liquidity whale nft whales need attract defi actual liquidity ,liquidity whale nft defi liquidity 
359889,lol common,
359890,uni bought genie means mainchat gonna ducked definft would new term image someone bought ape leverage long uni lending etc,term long 
359892,ye got done ust ,
359894,nft whales ones sold flipped frowned upon nft collectors ironic nft investors dislike defi cuz missed salty also ironic,nft nft nft defi 
359895,ye fact talk nft guys like get scammed dms talk us like ponzi scams shows divide two user groups,nft 
359897,still can't wrap head around integrating aggregator makes sense uni labs maybe wanted team develop inhouse nft liquidity protocol something,nft liquidity protocol 
359898,someone smarter work right assumption maths saw user bases overlap deterimined users high enough value acquire maybe team acquired really valuable,work 
359899,well nfts mainstream defi better worse ,defi 
359900,that's good point actually though always assumed gem one user share ,
359901,talk cheap need waffling objectively identify one likely ponzi,
359902,neither ponzi like either nfts ponzis defi ponzis value ,defi 
359903,easy way grow user base without wait new people enter space,

359925, ,
359926,nft rug projects learning experiences ,nft 
359930,heard uniswap v3 issues nft liquidity providers count nft whales ,nft liquidity nft 
359931,nft whale count ,nft whale 
359934,probably disagree mmorpg past truly believe digital ownership bad go past 10k pfp,

359937,what's ,
359940,something non factual random convo tried intervene convo got smileys nfts pixels quality ,non 
359941,i'm okay ending conversation think discussion quality actually means nft seems like legitimate topic conversation,nft 
359943,ser super subjective different everybody convos nft avenue literally dozen times fork okay devs need vested 3 yrs launch fair etc really ,nft fork 
359944,fair enough,
359945, ,

359953, irl tho ,
359954,hey gang trying explore onchain history cryptopunks sales seeing conflicting data opensea cryptopunks app site anybody able shed light ,data 
359955,punks created erc 721 standards opensea show transactions wrapped versions,transactions 
359956,believe vice versa 100% sure,
359957,thanks chiming think os tracks standard punks sales even combining lifetime vol erc721 wrapped punks 10k eth wonder also somehow tracking secondary market sales fractionalized punks via stuff like nftx ,eth market 
359958,standard abbreviation lending protocols like compound aave etc feels like roughly many different ones dexes good short name ,
359959,lex,
359968,coinbase poorly ipo peak raking offer high yields since fall lots venture capital different projects ftx firing people american way downturn japanese saying buy waiting 2q report say many exchanges without sec reporting ,

359973,liquidity crisis crypto needs zirp economic stimulus ,liquidity crypto 
359974,without excessive risk profiles venture capital retail flush cash crypto markets break solely way absorb appetite risk high demand tech speculation would disappeared without qe zirp usa,cash crypto 
359975,people afraid qe zirp stop due pandemic think ,stop think 
359976,ffr near 0 liquidity crisis happened march 2020 qe nowhere near crazy treasury markets deepest markets world usually unload hundreds billions bills without moving price 20 bps max march 2020 could offload 20 million 10 year treasury bills move price 100 bps depth gone liquidity disappeared happens crypto time like well makerdao entered shortfall ethereum grinded near halt surprise people thought saved last 2 years qe zirp going away ,liquidity year liquidity time ethereum 
359977,uhh missing something makerdao entered shortfall ethereum grinded near halt ,ethereum 
359978,yes that's correct need timely liquidations avoid shortfall never said entered shortfall reason ,
359979, ,
359980, grinded near halt means gas fees went dramatically mean ,gas

359987,general thoughts gavin always seemed like one space still reputation intact,
359988,either ftx already capital coinbase ipo point coinbase captured market share since perception coinbase better coinbase actually last year coinbase us uk eu,market year 
359989,ftx made huge jump foray going global 3 years coinbase working making us politicians happy lobbying efforts help sustained long term effort regulation ,term 
359990,mean describes eli5 way even normans understand like,eli5 
359991,coinbase futures derivatives trading desk etc,futures derivatives trading 
359992,ftx biggest profits extracting value solana shitcoins rotating liquidating derrivs apes otc seems like slowdowned lot recent years ,
359993,meant terms vision reputation alot original ethereum founders reputations exactly fared well whereas one seems speak ill gavin also still seems aspire original ethos,ethereum 
359994,sure trolling serious ,
359995,polkadot performed quite shitty cycle sure reputation many crypto natives still think scam lol,crypto 
359996,chain governance nice tho,chain governance 
359997,troll swear i'm interested general perception mind polkadot performed poorly i'd rather get tech correct,
359998,i'm big fan dotsama btw like xcmp think spree really unique general i'm fan whole architecture,
359999,reputation jumped cliff polkadot centralization aside frozen eth tried forcefully release,eth 
360000,onchain gov quite easy force users lock tokens duration vote,force tokens 
360001,mind expanding centralization issue right forum ,
360002,chain governance like voting short term gains e g trying push op native gas token thank goodness there'll citizen house keep check voting non crypto ethical things e g solend trying take someone's funds many negative examples past month,chain governance term e g gas token non e g 
360003,get rid storytelling cut right chase polkadot yet another dpos chain dpos 1 token 1 vote get cartel might nice friendly cartel cartel nonetheless,chain 
360004,mean say pos chains there's obviously spectrum i've seen prevalent accusation unique dpos,pos 
360005,dpos much unique selling point entire design there's difference cartel design maybe something far spectrums go dpos end whatever assume spectrum pos,pos 
360006,read yet seems relevant ,
360008,figures sometimes misleading,
360010,hey guys remember websites could breakdown ethereum transactions cant find atm,ethereum transactions 
360011,damn dystopia even work metamask installed,work 
360012, get tech correct imo cosmos hub superior implementation differences course end result cosmos also first vision afaik way ahead polkadot implementation adoption ,
360013,site helped add multiple network config metamask ,
360014, ,
360015,mmmm i'd tend disagree message passing chains cosmos superior polkadot imo lack shared security model considered superior cosmos ahead adoption sure say something binary cosmos superior polkadot nuanced also polkadot data availability built whereas cosmos independent chain could argued that's pro con depending side fence sitting ,data chain 
360016,mean guess forget pedo fud thing,
360017,haha actually forget take back ,
360018,well really fud uncertain terms accepted actually wrote blog post ,
360019,mean people obviously love weird erotica here's trader joe frankly bizarre erotica ,
360020,can't nice things,
360021,yeah think level nerd's weird kink lot different someone fantasising kids spark intellectual debate ,
360022,that's fair defending gavin,
360023,broke eth lost stupid tokens parity fuckup still love gav good buidlr good leader beach sunglasses jpg,eth tokens 
360024,pedo btw,

360027,forkless upgrades message passing shared security real killers ,
360028,yeah super impressed past upgrades i'm constantly getting messari updates cosmos chains that's meant disrespectful dive substrate built upgradeability elegant,
360030,nakamoto coefficient pos chains per latest tob audit done darpa,nakamoto pos 
360031,nakamoto coefficient represents number validators nodes would collude together successfully slow block respective blockchain functioning properly ,nakamoto block 
360032,analysis bad,analysis

360048,yes would like take look deeper analysis median % tokens given platforms projects trading volumes potential commission received exchange etc ,analysis tokens exchange 
360049,dont think many places gatehred data unfortunately especially centralized platforms profits probably shared,data 
360050,doubt info even publicly available,
360051,think centralized exchanges main income cases trading commissions including trading token,trading 
360052,would usually even know real % given private deals price performance also say much given assets went,
360053,think exchanges care price asset except commissions trading launchpad token nothing earn subjective opinion,
360054,remember drawn prices btt ignited fomo among many thereby pushing demand bnb trading volume increased significantly,fomo trading 
360055,meaningless distinctions within context analysis whether control direct change reality number entities need coerce undertake attack mention next page goes specifics mining pools actually function,analysis attack mining

360148,hmm dyd doesnt want starkware ,
360149,would imagine cosmos much cheaper starkware need cut right ,
360150,would validium right rollup stores proof computation make data computation available blockchain essentially similar current starkex architecture replaced dac cosmos blockchain ,data blockchain

360156,well least muh innovation lets see ux,
360157,decentralized sequencer implementation detail rather required feature zero rollup ,
360158,required feature rollup desirable one,
360159,mainly scalability censorship resistance,scalability 
360160,maybe something dont know eth network fees zkrollup big centralized sequencer reason,eth 
360161,plan starknet decentralize time sure timeline side though,time 
360162,i'd say perfectly valid reason censorship resistance dex pretty real requirement,
360163,reading correctly orderbook seems bit like mempool equivalent orders execution results stored chain state created orders memory validators ,bit chain state

360452,wrong chat responding ,
360453,solana phone conversation responded sry,
360454,ah sirin 3 0,
360455, ,
360456,il protection still active permanent loss dont protect,protection 
360457,database even working launching phone world mean,
360458,like samsung would launch diesel engine car display,
360459,lmao phone blockchain validates something traditionally organized orgs sure they'll stupid things attempt bandwagon get publicity,blockchain 
360460,means database starts working phone massie competitive advantage ,
360461,phone competitive advantage blockchain space ,
360462,eli5 ,
360463, database starts working primary area expertise broken they're going add new completely different area endeavor think going positive result ,
360464,abuilt hardware wallet integrates natively point sales systems real life payments would huge advantage,wallet 
360465,shutdown solana directly phone dedicated button ,
360466,called crypto debit card attached apple pay,crypto 
360468,one take weird crypto token hell outside blockchain space even knows sol works everyone even build entire phone ,crypto 
360469,works centralized entities though built payment infrastructure circumvents entire traditional system excellent,system 
360470,advantage think phone offers people currently using solana ,
360471,solana decentralized ,
360472,celsius withdrew 2000 ether bancor actually got 1200 making snark permanent loss impermanent loss bancor still working designed,
360473,excellent question forget phone offers people use solana moment bought ecosystem fully ,
360474,native ability crypto tx without really garbage third party apps hope ,crypto 
360475,mean ,
360476,literally wallet software free phone attached ,
360477,loss going discreptancy ,
360478,actually il bnt tanked cover il turned il protection think ,protection 
360479,wanted tx say pos stephangoss mentioned p2p tx anything else jump fifty hoops ,pos p2p 
360480,need produce entire tiny computer run single app ,
360481,os literally software attached piece hardware lol nonsensical critique,
360482,phone everything apps already best thing changes backend users could care less,
360483,os runs one application people already make phones oses run applications need make phone run single app ,application 
360484,argument feels like someone explaining touch screen phones dumb feature phones fine ,
360485,blockchains host one application ,application 
360486,get phone wait actually can't solana functioning ,
360487,basically suggesting move back feature phones ,
360488,yeah feel like 2008 tbh,
360489,general purpose phone run whatever app want including non shit wallet app ,non wallet 
360490,still need pos support everyone go route ,pos 
360491,ape phone something current one cannot gated access app apk would work elsewhere ,one 
360492,able tons headache vs able easily natively sets adoption vs obsolescence apart software ,
360493,people use phones much making blockchain transactions one sad phone native support making crypto tx ,blockchain transactions 
360494,argument one sirin brockshane phones let's pretend there's meaningful leap going,
360495,everything current phone need carry 2 phones need another phone next project,
360496,said built android would obviously able everything else ,
360497,oh come like meme someone lists 20 steps necessary pay bill check including licking stamp putting stamp envelope separate steps open app phone blockchain shit netflix button phone ,blockchain 
360498,feel like knee jerk culture war replies rn thoughtful commentary tbh,
360499,thoughtful commentary provided single reason phone optimized way run blockchain client would better existing phone run app including blockchain client ,
360500,look rates repayment bills send check instead use cc via website 1000% increase debt repayment kind make point yes ,
360501,yeah feels like solana dumb therefore everything hated us,
360502,problem less flaws solana selling phone,
360503,lol yeah literally point take 20 steps pay bill takes many steps deliberately name muscle movement step ,
360504,explain cheap seats exactly gain dedicated phone task vs app launched phone,
360505,remember we're talking android tons room screw around os features,
360506,hardware need support current phones ,
360507,think simplify phone mine cant cant current worth much ,
360508,point something possible like paying bill method headache like sending checks mean gets done well something easier app go phones rn makes possible crypto tx get adoption could bc headache decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal ergo good idea solana probably useful general crypto adoption ,crypto crypto 
360509,native implementation os ,
360510,said words concrete information exactly would different app running os vs existing one ,
360511,need make hardware ,
360512,idk plan could envisage number things native implementation would look like would make life easier i'm utilizing crypto day day basis ,crypto 
360513,name two ,
360514,target market solana users ,market 
360515,ability natively tap send money via solana chain friend next ability use biometrics confirm tx native browser yield farming ,money chain 
360516,1 done today android 2 requires browser support done current android devices ,
360517,use case excited able add addresses able use nft payment store payment terminals like apple wallet instead running credit card system submits signs blockchain transaction saves merchant 3% credit card fees,addresses nft wallet system transaction 
360518,originally answering someone's question someone using solana daily get yeah,
360519,name two ,
360520,two sucked ,
360521,see earlier points already done bad argument headache ,points 
360522,hell could launch wallet app ios tapped nfc tag ,wallet 
360523,exists solana user using iphone samsung idea dump devices ,dump 
360524,think build os ,
360525,explained needs hardware yet hard parts development users would get good experience developers hard work need entire new device ,developers work 
360526,right process via blockchain,blockchain 
360527,maybe they'd movs next phone change ,
360528,sure could metamask exists ,
360529,certainly interesting approach might actually end good ux,
360530,earth would ,
360531,giving apps benefit get ,
360532,i've actually said defended needs hardware look back i've talked exclusively os native implementation ,
360533,interesting handwaving app launches hit nfc tag app controls experience ,
360534,saying hardware bad idea either btw thought natural place quick debate someone ,
360535,os level features exist today need implemented work properly ,work 
360536,hard customize android os tons things user customization ,
360537,arguments making applies pretty much every major innovation last 20 years,
360538,wanna ad hominem please take way around adult iphone first came mp3 players came chance ,
360539,even close true ,
360540,yes ,
360541,see parallels ,
360542,noise around samsung offered sdk interact ethereum ,ethereum 
360543,maybe argued walkmen need mp3 players phones apps like weird one mobile need apple app store ,
360544,course,
360545,20 years ago comparisons dubious leap phones today whatever phone offering,offering 
360546,noise though asking genuine question seems like convo i've twenty years people entrenched systems ,
360547,obviously parallel mp3 players enabled something possible optical media tons problems magnetic media mp3 players easy response question i'm asking carry entire album pocket go running without skipping rewind possible existing tech iphone first phone browser actually worked touchscreen responsive enough navigate web page app ,
360548,reinventing anything whatever they're supposed offer something already,
360549,would possibly know even launched yet ,
360550,like seen 2007 presentation jobs gave ,
360551,worse people buy phones order interact brockshane interaction simply one things,order 
360552,laid extremely compelling case wanted iphone obvious anyone watching presentation world changed ,
360553,either shouting possible rim ,
360554,watched thing live night shift ,
360555,iphone example inaccurate using browsers phones years iphone iphone made easier accessible key ,key 
360556,like selling new brand hyping connection internet phone seriously connects internet faster phone ,
360557,think normies get minting useless nfts directly,
360558,something already possible argument development ,
360559,obvious iphone browser differed featurephone browsers ,
360560,last time watched product announcement ,time product 
360561,came ,
360562,obvious demo ,
360563,thing anything really announced crapping lol,
360564,clearly watch presented ,
360565,cupertino dude,
360566,okay bathroom browser demo ,
360567,well fact using android already makes conclusion fairly easy draw,
360568,familiar particular topic that's reminiscent days months heard type stuff people actually got experience phone ,type 
360569,solana phone changing world w e giving normies experienced obsessively documenting lives anew device they'll chain,e 
360570, decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal ,
360571,fact quite obvious thing lived demo going change everything question whether would live demo yes people said need anyway sure even demo compelling features ,
360572,think people went buy samsung phones ,
360573,could argue whether needed pinch zoom whatever whether wanted hardware keyboard made actual claims thing could want ,
360574,uhhh maybe it'll better integration nfc support ,
360575,represent solana idea thing lol,
360576,limited information ,
360577,put away breathless praise governance model announce something substantial produced ,governance 
360578,we're making phone standard traditional organizational bullshit ,
360579,i'm discussing crypto native phone could potentially useful least view think solana wise going arena although doubts they'll able deliver ,
360580,least hardware hard ,
360581,actually mentioned anything phone could potentially useful beyond current phones well enough though there's part experience made better os level integration ,
360582,must different levels patience crypto apps phones ,crypto 
360583,find exceptionally irritating experience ,
360584,yeah os problem apps,
360585,would nice stopped pretending they're breaking new ground something one recent history done,
360586, decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal ,
360587,think people went buy samsung phones ,
360588,we're agreement app,
360589,know least ,
360590,please post receipts,
360591,said beginning arguing os app hardware per se ,
360592,right well described anything needs os support improve ,
360593,unhappy current crypto apps cool make better app ,crypto 
360595,os level support needed someone able give example right ,
360596, think we're likely agree think ivangbi gonna get irritated circular arguments eventually lol,
360597,crypto specific desktop oses mean issues apply ,
360598,please finalize ur arguments 130 messages haha sorry 3,
360599,reason crypto specific many things,crypto 
360600,decent os native implementation good hardware security stuff actually matters brand name market experience captive audience much revenue think samsung got ,market 
360601,make custom rom work hardware available ,work 
360602,yes better crypto integration os level it'd neato,
360603,agree approach making phone ,
360604,though,
360605,anyone know valuation stepn raised ,
360607,use xpubkey calculate used addresses iirc,addresses 
360608,need os dos,
360609,features start 100 points must justify existence beyond 100 points,points points 
360610,want see another software company pretend hardware fail crypto crypto separate issue ,crypto 
360611,ivan going ban say last time one named single os feature would improve apps obviously need custom os improve apps ,time 
360612,support something natively build better optimized things without bunch hamfisting,
360613,i'm clearly talking people know nothing software hardware oses everyone keeps saying support natively means anything,
360614,know user code runs processor right access hardware os ,
360615,3 minutes lights ,
360616,tell getting frustrated isis dis de wei make point others ,
360617,also know oses module support enabling code loaded kernel enables native support without writing entire new os ,
360618,native support replacing bios efi installing new tpm chip need entirely new processor architectures ,
360619,cool that's one approach go 4 whoever i'm advocating reinventing wheel,
360620, nobody said os built scratch explicitly said based android ,
360621,kind 3 minutes cut thread ,
360622,think involves separating tpg rpi tbh sum comes even able calculate native psus ,
360624,selling point new phone brand allows connect brockshane directly yet vague definition directly covered phones work today well hope lot money keep manufacturers alive,work money 
360625,fruit phone iphone samsung bkk everybody else ,
360627,ok basta take dms blz ,
360628,let's dm ivangbi arguments per instruction p,

361810,here's vitalik's example ab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b,
361811,act going send usdc usdt weth,usdt

361815,address empty tho,
361816,yeah example try wallet address,wallet address 
361817,would people send transactions without 0x ,transactions 
361818,metamask used add 0x automatically,

361820,certain exchanges show without 0x,
361821,copy pasting address could get screwed,address 
361822,sent adress without 0x went random one ,
361823,yeah,

361827,weird,
361828,0x prefix indicate number hexadecimal rather base ethereum addresses hexadecimal,ethereum addresses

361980,usdd oh wait taken oh wait nobody care ,
361981, ,
361983,eip getting implemented though,
361984,probably verkle trees state implemented ,state 
361985,would like see ever implemented production environment uses create2 selfdestruct loops heavily sandbox value storage see actually implemented knowledge benefits former practice spread,
361986,important question needs production environment outweigh needs many good sir ,
361987,benefit ,
361988,hard fork bricks lots money popular hard fork ,fork money fork 
361989,create2 selfdestruct clear abuse hole ethereum design closed,ethereum 
361990,good luck forking away,
361991,less gas intensive far safer paradigm value storage currently accepted practices,gas 
361992,brick alot money according eip sendall still used retrieve funds,money 
361993,blow meta transactions though,transactions 
361994,create2 reverts contract already exists,contract 
361995,gas made measure want save real money costs makes sense simplify nodes remove dubious opcodes raise gas limit,gas money gas 
361996,understand please explain eip bricks alot money ,eip money 
361997,process quite simple predict new contract location using create2 determinism send tokens contract address contract exploit ready withdraw deploy contract address retreive tokens call selfdestruct save gas ,contract tokens contract address contract contract address tokens gas 
361999,contract already exists address selfdestruct bricked create2 reverts iirc,contract address 
362000,says exactly eip,
362001, applications affected change use breaks contract created address using create2 selfdestruct ,contract address 
362002,using faulty metric performance must measured gas proportional gas limit,gas gas 
362003,holes like create2 selfdestruct prevent consensus radically raising gas limit,consensus gas 
362004,contract never deployed chain blocks dramatically reduce gas expenditures incurred single transaction ,contract chain gas transaction 
362005,able implement check avoid redeploy somewhere else ,
362006,upgradeable system good code designed immutable possible,system 
362007,get rugged something implemented designed,
362008,exactly bad eip,
362009,even auditors started recommending self destructing clone pattern secure ,self 
362010,almost equivalent permanently locking liquidity uniswap v1 rage left dead v2 v2 getting rekt v3 though fortunately v3 go expected department almost worse,liquidity rekt 
362011,create2 selfdestruct never intended pattern fact abuse hole design prevent closing said hole,
362012,intention irrelevant,
362013,getting bricked relevant either,
362014,yeah designed acceptable paradigm chain looking like evm wants pull rug anyways firmly opposed eip people's money stake can't change rules game implemented poor design begin people followed design,chain money stake 
362015,supposedly immutable platform building immutable contracts ,
362016,funny stuff,
362017,ethereum never gave promise evm ever change,ethereum 
362018,lol,
362019,pattern challenges fabric immutability user's pov though ,fabric immutability 
362020,somehow we're applying frontier opcode gas rules today ,gas 
362021,fair assumption methods allowed value stored accessed change feet ,
362022,perhaps away apparent farce immutable contracts knows unexpectedness needing hardfork discover future eh ,
362023,certainly think anyone used system assumption evm might make changes made value inaccessible,system 
362024,except sload gas tweaked one time brick someone,gas time 
362025,dont think true give promise understandble things change,
362026,far know eip still draft seems like people want things change appear foregone conclusion,
362027,last checked design pretty much finalized discussed allcoredevs,
362028,point sendall allow siphoning residual value ,
362029,case perhaps consider changes behavior create2 well ,
362030,low level change bricks least one value storage system exactly good look particularly none done desire exploit anything increase security ,system 
362031,platform building static contracts next hardfork good base,
362032, least 70k contracts impacted,
362033,people cry cruft things like windows js would much rather twist elaborate pretzels knowingly going ahead bricking functioning programs oops unexpected interaction ,
362034,perhaps vitalik losing wow thingy justified never promised permanence,
362035,kind interesting looking metamorphic contracts disdain contracts use mechanism although metamorphic,mechanism 
362036,breaking one use case would likely necessitate breaking,
362037,that's like saying get rid delegatecall upgradeble contracts used rug ,
362038,nobody's saying,
362039,reason behind gettting rid pave way verkle trees rugs taken consideration,

362049,btw need selfdestruct omit selfdestruct part,
362051,code already live use months ,
362052, ,
362053,sandboxed counterfactual storage systems rely selfdestruct effectively function removed create2 changed revert existing contracts would brick system,system

362158,potential solution could check another oracle checks peg eth locked assets native chain locked assets peg breaks operations allowed spitballing def really interesting worth tackling tbh ,oracle eth chain 
362160,stop using chainlink push report correctly chain's data,chain data 
362161,either implement specific weight price coming x chain chain something else,chain chain 
362162,would easier check chainlink well local amm use lower two prices borrowing ,
362163,basically pulling data cexes add 50% weight native dex chain native usdc use,data chain 
362164,would hugely problematic lower liquidity chains cause whole slew even worse issues,liquidity

363201,they're ones entitled crying tg either moot point bring,
363202,consider fact screenshot essentially paraphrase andre's comment raise money anyone community bullshit theory follows someone token best interest whatever increase value token na guess partly fault defi community calling governance tokens people want govern trenches helping fight instead throne dictator simply shouting orders plebian developers need execute care protocol care would soon sell token longer think contributing enough standards try add value happy spending endless hours time asking updates explain detail thought processes endless back forth pointless menial topics governance community kill innovation development ,money defi governance tokens developers protocol spending time governance 
363203,that's point get issue raise directly indirectly retail emotional responses people clearly fit make investment decision ,
363204,wrong,

363212,raise money satoshi raised money randoms willingly bought btc chose run nodes floor raising money bought token dex thinking i'd get rich conversation absurd,money money btc money token 
363213,wish could say right unfortunately case people claw faces tiny bit power feel comfortable enough consistently bite heels money unfortunately amplifies problem ,bit money 
363214,oh euphemism 100%,
363215,community users well token holders extent funders experimental innovative products balance community devs needed bad behaviour exists sides spectrum,
363216,really want dive andre situation he's satoshi made quite bit money even constantly larping opposite,satoshi bit money 
363217,chasm user token holder,token 
363218,community devs entitled wana build distractions accountability justified take public money,money 
363219,i'm claiming he's satoshi,
363220,necessarily,
363221,mean satoshi made lot money sell mean ain't rich ,satoshi money 
363222,idea making money takes away anything funny case point,money 
363223,basic point create expectations kind profit potential let everyone participate opportunity going deal stuff can't handle keep private ,
363224,strawman ser,
363225,want claim even 50% token holders dapp users ,
363226,mean make argument side can't handle risk volatility early stage projects buy ,
363227,reason people launch tokens want make money there's always upside creator intend take money general public deal ,tokens money money 
363228,yes fully agree ,
363229,almost sides people act predictable ways ,
363230,friction misplaced expectations ,
363231,without accurate data claim otherwise claiming token holders usually vested interest also users dapp user also translate buying vision dapp project,data dapp dapp 
363232,yeah retail expect get rich devs expect retail behave informed rational way simply put ,
363233,arguing strawmen ,
363234,bull tokens go tokens good bear tokens go tokens bad things even need token anyways ,tokens tokens bear tokens 
363235,first define raising money retail absurd bought token dex expect get rich attacking something nobody arguing,money token 
363236,clarified meant get ,
363237,meaningless okay,
363238,safe conclude wen numbah go devs dicks community entitled dicks numbah go devs hero community geniuses,
363239,strange would count sufficient data ,data 
363240,save network tokens almost everyone user virtue needing pay gas fees claiming there's dapp mere token holders outnumber users least 5 1 ,gas dapp 
363241,expect crypto different traditional finance gatekeeping invest project match expectation instead expecting people take responsibility buying reasonable imo instead telling devs use private funding ,crypto finance 
363242,expecting people behave like centuries always unreasonable crypto magically going fix greed gambling ,crypto greed 
363243,claiming anything also trying get argument highlighting rational assumption token holders also users lot smart teams know exactly utilise tokens bootstrap user base,tokens 
363244,mean worked bank upon time beyond irate customers sometimes shitty behaviours ever recall receiving end level nonsense say happen nowhere near level happens crypto i'm sure argument weight people demonstrated capable controlling weird whatever reason seems get pass crypto like haha that's crypto ,time crypto crypto crypto 
363245,really valid point imo however harsh reality raising public money always come public accountability positive negative ,money 
363246,less anonymity less risk probably makes difference ,
363247,nobody arguing token holders can't get expect get rich sure insinuate anyone people arguing anyone get rich coincidentally retail comment matter noteworthy,
363248,yes safe say expecting people change unreasonable accurate we're expecting people change there's expectation people behave civily already day day lives ,
363249,people generally dicks internet risk punched face non existent,non 
363250,even decentralized financial system instead already working centuries point people need manage greed gambling point entering new system reasonable expectation make acquainted new rules instead expecting everything ultimately want greed gambling restricted others know manage ,system greed system greed 
363251,um ahem maybe curse experience cannot agree rational cannot think single project true one,
363252,tbh idea point i'm saying projects first let retail close muh toxicity failed due diligence get using excuse exit problem first since 2022 ,exit 
363253,even make sense face ,
363257,uh clear that's wrt users vs mere token holders,
363258,bear market digest ,bear market 
363259,yes naive 3 weeks ago brought people said insinuated wrong included fwiw yes probably misunderstand what's talked,
363260,man would literally come w new definitions go therapy,

363263,lol cardano layer 0 basis chart seems skewed bunch different areas layer 2 3 specific eth,eth 
363264,certainly welcome taxonomy hierarchy blockchain stacks would helpful avoid conflicting existing usage,
363265,different discussion deal toxic community members denying existence ,
363266,e g layer 0 community consensis layer 3 rollups rollups,e g 
363267,well layer 3 starkware invention industry wide term guess ,term 
363268,eh insinuating toxicity almost exclusively tethered price due able build worthwhile community questionable ,
363269,i'll say i've said times consider coddling retail treating adult babies entitled risk free profit devs naive enough think talk community save toxicity naive like said unless first happens naivety remain,
363270,let's cut feel bad spamming room another iteration think disagree much new things say,

363406,agreed spare time building dictionary chechen language also like hydroponic set ups growing things,time 
363407,different kind bug killing hehe,
363409,really fun good way break away behind screen least away people screen,
363410,love said 'regulation' mean ccp surveillance state ,state

363428,compared ,
363429,compared irl people making goood money maybe touch af,money 
363430,i'm saying bagholders love cry builders making money like detracts anything,money 
363431,alas seemingly evergreen example,
363432,referring illegal tweet mentioned previously europoors mev searchers ,
363433,front running even illegal thought spoofing illegal frontrunning fine ,
363434,frontrunning based insider knowledge illegal time ,time 
363435,front running illegal acting insider info quite subjective there's evidence often judged case case intent magnitude damage done market taken considerstion,market 
363436,oh yeah referring hft based front running ,
363437,front running illegal 99 9% cases,
363438,guess insider info still based information asymmetry ,
363439,yeah thought spoofing illegal,
363440,ah know client going sell big size sell front insider info illegal,know 
363441,yeah depends whether way got information deemed fair basically ,
363442,unless publicly announced position predicted certain position taken,
363443,orderflow robinhood,

363456,throwing stones glass house ffs,
363457,double slit experiment says,
363458,spoofing illegal tradfi frontrunning illegal common,
363460,yes front running common common front running see remains illegal front running done upon covert information sure sort front running talking tbh leave since convo formally closed point ,
363461,frontrunning covert information afaik publicly available information mempool ,
363462, actually mev crypto based public information ,crypto 
363463,bera market ration ,market 
363464,yes transaction reordering dont know much gas person willing pay hence dont know transaction get picked na,transaction gas person transaction 
363465,hi guys dexs besides curve trying provide deep chain liquidity pegged value crypto assets ,chain liquidity crypto 
363466,nothing deep curve try smaller tvl dexs like saddle finance thats basically fork,finance fork 
363467,sound right miners choosing prioritize txs pay see fit block building works referring something else ,block 
363468,thanks know saddle want find another examples i'll try look forks,
363469,yes core thats front running works,
363470,solidly forks like velodrome op use stableswap curve well,
363471,mev geth miner receives arb trade decides execute instead including original transaction ,miner transaction 
363472,uniswap v3 used,
363473,actually sure mev geth checks ,
363474,platypus avax uses diff oracle based approach,oracle 
363475,also solidly amm curve,
363476,one i'd love see formal research,
363477, frontrunning describing happening based public information,
363478,transaction part public mempool watch increase gas theoretically using private transaction service ,transaction gas transaction 
363479,solidly good idea poor execution vecrv positions liquid fnfts positive thing we've fantom liquiddriver spiritswap see active secondary picking steam allows anyone buying lqdr increase cost basis tokens locked means get dumped xlqdr unlocks years ,cost tokens 
363480,balancer focused primarily stable pools stablemath pools steth eth stable liquidity,eth liquidity 
363482,balancer stablepool based curve's stableswap ,
363483,yea ,
363484,yes agree original front run happens public info however front runners bots catch transaction guys essentially playing poker guys bid highest gas get transaction ser individual,transaction gas transaction 
363485,that's sounds like different problem tangential frontrunning though mention intermittent period tx confirmed allows use public information also frontrun frontrunners inclined ,
363486,right,
363487,anyone use otoco io similar platforms spin legal stuff project ,
363489,heard podcast ago looks like cool solution i'm curious legit real legal aspect ,
363490,kalidao sure court would honour,
363491,also curious legally legit forming entity may legally bind ways unknown changing legal environment,
363492, definitely cool tho ,
363493,check thanks ,

363535,dont think lol,
363536,great launch w ribbon well ser ,
363537,nice start seemed,
363538,think fickle dev reg,
363539,interesting thought worked quite time even see launching shitcoin dump noobs,time 
363542,bonus nft lobster holders understand case ghouls ,nft 
363543,removed link cause nft gambling chat anyway ,nft 
363545,tradfi move bills u retail treasury trade w plebs billionaires u via certified blabla agencies take cut 3% u see gonna 2% best really likely less idk ofc depends ur net worth u negotiate fees,
363546,anyone run get node yes what's major usecase ,node 
363548,care decentralisation run service want get rate limited provider low latency stuff like mev miner validator,miner 
363549,also vibes,
363550,also calls like eth getlogs available lot providers resource intensive use case requires might run node,node 
363551,question lenders right default pay back depositors kind ie eth btc etc liquidate usd pay back usd ,eth btc usd usd 
363552,also want get snapshot time answer costs run node,time node 
363553,silly report requires 3 tb going run 750 mb case ,
363554,think still useful tbh never really know requirements recommendations made sometimes things work even far what's listed requirement,
363555,fair,
363556,still think done bad faith,
363557, funny read icp,
363558,know bitcoiners call bad faith lopp starts baseline assumption able run node easy enough anyone basic consumer hardware something common circles benchmarks least see simply seeing conforms,know node 
363559,seem remember puzzled eth though i'd check,eth 
363560,feel like kicking tires know eth massive storage requirements instructions say anyways found bsc one interesting time completed 20 something gb wonder,eth time 
363561, worse performance requires higher hardware costs prices users able attain sovereign security model enabled running node intent pretty clear,node 
363562,far reasonable 99 9999% bitcoin maxi figureheads,bitcoin 
363563,fair still think m00t like running probabilistic model feasibility transactions fees sustaining bitcoin network mining rewards end least eth trying something acknowledges problem,transactions mining eth 
363564,well go article see actually cares minimum viability run node,node 
363565,would trivial expensive set baseline arbitrarily high fit even solana well answer different question,
363566,project actually core value anyone participate without amassing hardware ,
363567,power equate gains,
363568,may want try bitcoin whitepaper believe also mentioned ethereum's,ethereum 
363569,remember difference mining validating simply node network,mining 
363570,wanted write og btc values ,btc 
363571,celo iirc seem remember trying make sure could run node phone,
363572,helium ogs anyone even using running token inflation since start,inflation 
363573,celo staking afaik still discrepancy,
363574,validation bitcoin otherwise intractable problem participate consensus economies scale always tend towards centralisation work start wants solve e one cpu vote using asymmetric aes encoding research shows probably pointless 5 years someone would come asic defeat,consensus work e 
363575,maybe mina ,
363576,qortal know,
363577,ones solid model equal participation network everyone,
363578, solid tech built like fully onchain decentralized chat neat features,
363579,running node running validator btc high bar entry mining node,node btc high entry mining node 
363580,whats point running node definition og btc whitepaper ,node btc 
363581,seems pretty hand wavey lacks clear description consensus works,consensus 
363582,wiki,
363583,tech works dont focus much optics marketing,
363584,buidl,
363585,verify everything network access history mempool directly,
363586,think someone like alchemy infura doubt they're mining they're running lot nodes,doubt 
363587,assuming block rewards per block fixed still leads towards centralisation farms eventually rewards running single validators dont cover costs,block block 
363588,mint get sponsored already existing member,
363589,issue self sponsorship addressing right,self 
363590,point qortal amass money though create decentralized internet,money 
363591,p2p,p2p 
363592,right host simple websites network concept proven work,work 
363593,also rewards progressively lower time eventually voted network,time 
363594,bigger problem need sponsored ,
363595,based screenshot stuff moving opposite direction decentralized ,
363596,yeah gives secret society vibe,
363597,refferal system,system 
363598,malicious people set hard mount sybil attack think meant mentioned self sponsorship,attack self 
363599,agree perfect though use qortal without sponsored sponsorship entitles minting rewards,
363600,crosschaintrade chat use websites without sponsorship,
363601,anyway cool unknown model may valuable hard regulations kick people love jungle aspect crypto,
363602,sure that's different thing,
363603,reminds steem could count number entities network 1 hand,

366152,saying profitable grand scale,
366153,like credit card defaults,
366154,profitable ,
366155,paying back credit card profitable,
366156,enjoy purchases,
366157,like jet ski paddling pool watch,
366158,nothing like credit cards,
366159,credit card defaults prevent person getting future credit cards 2 3 credit card providers cross checks work address defi ,person work address defi 
366160,exploratory conversation ,
366161,riffing,
366162,yeah comparison,
366163,banning essentially alphanumeric gibberish using contract nothing return money lost prevent getting new account,contract money 
366164,new account requires staking,
366165,one implementation means coordinate pull,
366166,address defaults gets blacklisted across defi already highly unlikely since protocol blacklist reason someone decided give undercollateralized loan go cex new address build good credit give nice bonus year ,address defi protocol address year 
366167,yes think blanket fresh accounts history interaction start horrendously low base,
366168,requirement ye think undercollaterised reputation trust,trust 
366169,think outsource trust scalable model ,trust 
366170,imagine lengths people go game airdrops dont see reason would put less effort game uncollateralised loans,
366171,upside access global credit top must valuable enough best allocators credit capital offset losses initial scammers defaulters gaming access system,losses system 
366172,well need look 3ac see looks like,
366173,upside capped since alternative using overcollateralized loan,
366174,isolated system blacklist others follow suit like score ,system 
366175,hmmmmmm,
366176,everyone follow suit chain credit rating agency centralised decentralised ,chain 
366177,yeh completely inventing wheel think perhaps peer peer attestation ownership could thing,peer attestation 
366178,many people prove assets,
366179,see using score calibrate personal collateral ratio good returning customer get 115% fresh address 150% ,customer address 
366180,physical assets onboarded onto crypto without solving oracle problem,crypto oracle 
366181,yeh sure ,
366184,legal framework accommodate chain assets,chain 
366185,yep enforceability piece,
366186,beginning everyone friendly nice repay debt time well world every repayment system trusts progressively credit maybe even survive bear market one day vanishes left missing 10b point announce banned account ,time system bear market 
366187,yeah,
366188,could happen,
366189,real world equivalent depending got money nice men 5 wrench would come visiting ask search couch change spare nice men nice men exactly anything hold onto smart contracts ,money ask 
366190,point requiring credit men wrenches indeed tell wallet address stake indeed break legs,wallet address stake 
366191,perhaps send one hope something,
366192,expect major usage credit traceable blockchain btw bilateral attestations banks crypto lenders struggled,blockchain 
366193,make affordance decentralization solution pretty trivial we've since interestingly named salt days 2017,decentralization 
366194,well trivial regulated lending business,
366195,would say core protective tenants regulation ,
366196,regulators decide accurately would demonstrate current rules whatever may apply,
366197,core requirement regardless spun centralization somebody needs able knock door event however unlikely bottom falls whether nice 5 wrench nice set documents,event 
366198, lawyers group odds team gets held accountable long timeline case like,
366199,remember alameda ftx announced investment put radar stayed away vibes discord backed republic galaxy digital alameda research ngc coinfund kraken curious dumper,
366200,thread said investors saft0 dumped,
366201,saft0 means pre seed right ,seed 
366202,according thread leftover tokens public sale sold via otc,tokens 
366203,anyone else feel cz active twitter nowadays ,twitter 
366204,thanks clarifying problematic allocation never disclosed anyone knows could family member ,
366206,decides thing especially ,
366207, fyi lobs,
366208,put 15k one ring seed round never claimed anything something available ,ring seed 
366209, notsofast retweeted past 8 months billionaire exchange owner threatening harassing giving domain owned since 2017 binance's cz arguably largest proponent decentralization resorted centralized means order steal domain ,exchange decentralization order 
366210, domain ,
366211,lol know might scammer posing binance ,
366212,possible doubt thread pretty detailed,doubt 
366213,overlook something certain tweet i'll leave adventurous eyes notice,
366215,rs og btc 2012 aint going without fight ,btc 
366216,guess second round 5k,
366217, ,
366219,good fake pretty sure,
366221,best take chance ,
366222,luna good,
366224,think would process buying distressed companies insolvent ,
366230,binance ca domain seems like domain squatter,
366231,lobsters participating solana hacker house ux ui important math question combination 3 elements generation image nft target 5k nft max user many properties require found use factorials way definitely suck math,generation nft nft 
366232,3 different types element like hat shoe socks want total 5k combinations ,
366233,would want 17 18 since 17 cubed 4900,
366234,change one element 20 hats 15 shoes smth variety one,
366235,yeah three numbers whose product around 5000,product 
366236,hum bit problematic think adding types elements actually background img background color logo fixed count proprety guess pattern,bit think 
366237,want users create 3 5 properties,
366238,thank guys way truly appreciate,
366239,really complicates idea x x,
366240,user opportunity create nfts 3 4 5 properties ,
366241,yolo,
366242,wanted make users able generate 5k nfts 3 images seeing responses idea would know many total attributes users need starting input let say user wants mint 1k nfts formula give amount elements needed total simply divide 3 solving two problems way first require proprieties users want mint 5 10 15 nfts lastly enable users mint 5k nfts able provide enough elements,
366243,understood well reasoning would solve input x 3 ,
366244,domain squatting illegal ,
366245,main thing keep types proprieties low possible 3 would ideal 4 would ok 5 would probably limit would make building pretty bothering users event tag generator building,event 
366246,net nfts cases 5k assuming nfts minted 3 4 5 properties equal e 1666 defining properties sample space becomes 1666 0 333 1666 0 25 1666 0 2 ,e 
366247,1666 0 2 meaning case 5 total propoertiesyou property variations around 4 5,
366248,oh understood well would proprety user input 1 3 ,
366249,would optimal expect users probably mint 1k,
366250,also let users input much x z want enter property compute resulting number nfts minted x z,
366251,oh think also go something simple problem develop users know total nfts first knowing x z event tags based number people attend event serve basis know many elements need ,event event 
366252,overall clearer idea proceed guys additional feedback let know wanted thank much helping first irl hackaton want make newly met teammates proud working,
366253, ,
366254,owned domain rights,
366255,might win case idea canadian law says squatting says registered domain bisexual girlfriend nance hilarious could work us he'd lose pretty quickly,
366256,likely facetious yes he's probably going lose ironic situation considering cz friends probably spent much farce already,
366258,real goes different school ,
366259,yo lobsters anyone using used crypto market data api like coingecko cmc cryptocompare others i'm conducting research hoping learn api use case user experience please dm chat ,crypto market data api cmc api 
366260, ,
366261,wen ens suit ,
366262,using hodler sh app cmc really good expensive also policy grow 100k mau disconnect cryptocompare became paid point switched coingecko good stable free right limits,cmc 
366263,hey trying hodler app last month shared team love simple sleek ui ah thanks info coingecko rocks p work cg always open hear feedback anyone improve cg products api happy learn discuss users even used competing site app that's keep us innovating better grow industry together ,work api

366265,anyone got link something shared recently allowing check token balance address time ,address time 
366266,thank sharing sure understand similar website people upload proprieties elements ,
366267,actually read article sure understand shared sorry ,
366268,oh need website that's already done static parts something like web ui hashlips ,
366269,noo need make website 1 two parts dapp developing hh paris,dapp 
366270,get,
366271,depends domain literally binance something he's wrong ,
366272,general bro i'm gonna build app stuff weird looks like he's trying squad domain clearly violates registered trademark matter whether domain registered first afaik ,
366273,ah yes apparently binance ca guy dumbass believing basis keeping ,
366274,ok couch lawyers case closed ,
366276,mean register com domain automatically get rights appropriate extensions people registered well ,
366277,works ,
366278,thats works registering trademark domain jurisdictionally dependent stuff talking generalized way upset ivan ,

366281,also rainbowkit really nice library web3 auth,
366282,hey guys currently building decentralised platform help emerging crypto experts validate expertise thus increase following reputation platform enable people make predictions various crypto events chosen users correct predictions could tokenised displayed web3 web2 social media platforms please dm find idea useful interesting ,crypto crypto 
366283,tokenised fact ,
366284,pure vanity utility ,
366285,cover image vibe,
366286,tokenise expertise verified terms utility vanity integrating tokens e quantified expertise existing ecosystem tokens non transferable represent fair evaluation one's knowledge crypto ,tokens e non one crypto 
366288,degenscore extra steps ,
366289,understand question correctly asking platform would different degenscore right propose framework evaluating expertise fairly using prediction markets created users expert score depend popularity complexity events predicted correctness predictions ,
366290,experts usually simply netting 51% wrong bets 100% ,
366292,sure understand question asking still expert without 100% correct track record ,
366293,amazing lmao ,
366294,lol,
366295,uniqueness japan,
366296, ,
366297,opinion guys,
366298,looks interesting,
366302,basically trading others putting money trade ,money 
366303,many complex terms,
366304,social trading cool idea many different ways implemented attempted back days chain fund even one banteg things like set protocol way reason neither implementations ever caught tam could influencers rake cash scam posts moon soon weird ,trading chain fund protocol cash 
366305,dhedge enzyme social trading,trading 
366306,interesting yeah ideally work guess think issue need part every trade trader net profitable size ratio entering one trade would lead huge gains losses right ,work losses 
366307,single trade might serve purpose,
366308,yes work,
366309,ye need trades past acitivty never future performance,
366310,actually trying solve plus adding fun level solution least see build several levels layers ,
366311,that's true,
366312,every trader cycles ,
366313,successful period must come destructive one,
366314,well that's true still better chance single trade,
366315,may share topic first iteration layer ,
366316,platform identifies relative expertise get expert tokens correctly predict outcome difficult market difficulty context determined among things number incorrect predictions said market ,tokens market difficulty market 
366317,there's several problems social trading basically 1 they're consistently profitable traders worth following 2 one actually appears strategy gets crowded seizes profitable 3 strategy public people simply copy without going social trading platform,trading trading 
366318,yes three correct,
366319,wish harmony cared improving tech seems focusing things even matter see q3 focus ,
366320,add social trading scalable social trading platform usuals expect developer build end end development pipeline fetching data feature engineering feature evaulation testing strategy building risk management cases simpler profitable trades well long tailed cannot manage much capital strategies ,trading trading developer data 
366321,foundation falling apart inside,
366322,think original harmony difficult position,
366323,yea harmony always late wrong everything stumble without well defined plan sharding already bit old fashioned large part team left project ,sharding bit 
366324,successful traders platforms get cut profits others make copying trades right effectively way successful traders hedge fund without one get deploy capital strategies get cut profits,fund 
366325,definition successful traders successful share trades right,
366326,ignoring fixing apis rpc security pegging bridged assets etc focus minting nfts adding fiat ramp think possible become ghost chain,fiat chain 
366327,necessarily c f e burry's short tesla big trades rewarded talking book people jump trade benefit ,e 
366328,apply copy trading retail platforms course mostly scam facilitate customer trading thus commissions often times profit broker dealer cos trade customer ,trading customer trading customer 
366329, ,
366330,trademark,
366331,clearly gonna stop,
366332,well high certainty trade signal really incentive share would expect marke information get incorporated market prices regardless telling everyone however incentive share pseudo trade signals motivation get folks ape turn trade signal self fulfilling prophecy,market self 
366333,think l one traders followed public creates great security concerns sometimes share strategies profit honest l wont use gcr short list make anons make couple thousands trading journey turn selfish long profitness increase get afraid strategies copied stolen ,public 
366334,crypto right enough liq even top traders add funds without enough volume wise risk management ,
366335,real question add size dox alpha chain analytics firms plying sophisticated analysis anyone size anyone good strats getting rekt nansen ,chain analysis rekt 
366336,real problem ecosystem shelf life creative alpha short defi ,defi 
366337,maybe mechanism preventing liquidation hunt ,mechanism 
366338,usually trade binance people l know minority trades ftx except bull market barely trade defi use nansen especially execute strategies essential ,market defi 
366339,yeah come trade strat subscription service alpha ,
366340,that's tricky wonder much liquidation hunting based know fund xyz size size ,know fund 
366341,dont believe alpha every trade another independent battle gurantee work always ,work 
366342,there's great debate right there's importance getting people bandwagon want get way getting chain analytics makes tough heavily tracked folks buy position ,chain 
366343,maybe wanna shop otc order flow need unload big block need world see idk think way chain analytics work bit perversion price discovery ,order block chain work bit 
366344,like battle hard element privacy also buy alpha there's people lead market e renaissance technologies alpha shop long ass time tradfi nansen thing back day would dudes made gains think ,market e time 
366345,even alpha trade secrets right charge mgmt performance fee people copy trade everything ,
366348,3ac leaded market lts ok long lead push price alone 69k without support problem start market leads ,market market 
366356,yeah renaissance consistently bringing 66% annualised returns 30 years basically done incredible job leaking info outsiders,
366363,exactly 100% key privacy protects gains stance self adjudication others see mission critical adversarial markets ,self 
366382,one point note though privacy often times used synonymously intransparency privacy enhanced tech blockchains adopting showing us seems common misconception also led lot larger corporates jump bandwagon aping idea private blockchains thinking privacy established introducing opaque closed systems,
366416,lemme post something interesting peace ,
366417,think fair point things need transparent things e smart contract verify looking looking code see going operate expect critical mean balance public participate crypto markets ,e contract crypto 
366418,exactly spot transparent systems respecting user privacy mutually exclusive fact complementary imo one biggest opportunities web3,
366419,profitable trader would even go hassle participating social trading first place important question solved imo ,trading 
366420,expect fait finances swipe debit card want vendor bob's soda shop know we're swiping card enough pay soda however bob need know much money bank account total much i've spent past able follow future forever long use debit card idk got far crypto path wallet side privacy suppose work stuff product fit brainer really ,money crypto wallet work product 
366421,reason correct,
366422,regarding alpha i've observed quite time interesting phenomenon logical think publishing alpha calls several times incoming dumps market mix chain social data analytics yet almost one seemed care much even went angry market crashed analyses get appreciation bought subscriptions well yet real alpha leave market seems somewhat little discussed even addressed participatants keep looking alpha understanding buy imo totally wrong interesting human psychology ,time market chain data market market 
366423,feel people new crypto understand gain knowing leave enter ,crypto 
366424,yes that's obviously case,
366425,like 2015 2017,
366426,still wonder though first 6 months crypto enough get important namely exiting market rather partially rebalancing stables rest secondary,market 
366427,believe people learn actually adjust talk much especially talks appreciated say least market pumps ,market 
366428,agree personal analysis newcomers see crypto assets like stock investment even worse lottery higher % success want learn want flip without knowledge alpha groups seem best solution many people seen understanding word basic cg page ,analysis crypto 
366429,human psychology win thanks lose market,market 
366430,true manipulation 'terrible alameda lol,
366431,never stupid ,
366432,exactly never learn philosophy imo,
366439,chit chats lobsterdao kingdom anything proper content permamuted ,
366441,king ivan,
366442,amazing see finally becoming mainstream thought instead fringe thinking,
366443,permissionless privacy first accept substitute,permissionless

366447, ,
366449,thanks posting great article ,
366451,interesting wondering anyone would put effort create something like feels almost like whoever wrote script video lost lot ust trying make persiflage founder cultism ironically may fallen wondering whether people upset kwon maybe upset long stuff like helps people find peace mind ,
366452,maybe wanted make something thought would funny none assuming ever crossed mind ,
366453,yeah probably right,
366458,ivan still stables,

366541,hey guys question finalize direction team let building frontier tech project wiser deploy eth one major l1 especially transaction fees fundraising problems merge lower transaction fees easier fundraise eth ,eth transaction transaction eth 
366542,merge nothing tx fees fundraising ,
366543,u building defi project compostable major protocols supposed used whales ethereum choice u building retail oriented dapps defi gamefi nfts etc choose evm chains l2s focus user cases fundraising,defi ethereum defi 
366545,txt fees lower merge ,
366547,merge effectively swapping consensus mechanism,consensus mechanism 
366548,building something new fear deploy layer1 someone steal idea copycat eth network l fundraise eth ,fear eth eth 
366549,direct effect txfees,
366550,would different deployed alt l1 like polygon avalanche ,
366551,get information happen exactly merge like exact moment happens eventual side effects etc ,
366552, ,
366553,userbase eth much higher risky bet us deploy brand new idea like uniswap opensea somewhere else eth,eth eth 
366554,yea whole process supposed seemless end user right like actual transition require anything specific,
366555,nothing dapp devs,dapp 
366556,always copy cats idea good focus rather worry others,
366557,whats ur fav solidity editor used like webstore free trial wondering there's anything good hate vscode cuz made devil,solidity

366565,imo visual studio pretty cool also lot nice plugins like solidity visual auditor consensys,solidity 
366566,rather soul intact ,
366567,shrug wait chain start finalizing,chain 
366568,yeah sure accidentally choose wrong ide code start smell might end hell better safe sorry one,
366569,might die everyone forgets also run el client instance fix setup fast stake start leaking,stake 
366570,think gets real spicy price everything probably start cratering cex defi stuck lol,defi 
366571,specific scenario think chain still advance able finalize there's enough % stake attesting,chain stake 
366572,see,
366573,also l2 keep functioning right ,
366574,might depend l2,
366575,51% stake chain make progress 2 3 finalize apparently,stake chain 
366576,there's definitely world makes sense removing borrowing lending type leveraged positions preemptively,type

366579,5k would approx 17x18x19 around 54 assets 15 18 20 4 almost maths simplified version permutation maths way enough case ,
366580,that's think collections never doubles,
366581,divide 55 numbers attributes want tada,
366582,that's strict minimum better increase base layers bit redundant,
366583,lol true almost decentralized social networks installed new tumblr year half ago called newlife made blockchain creatives artists weirdos extremely minimal interface words icons supposed intuitive still sure think often forget navigate likes lenght pressing image finger shows much like stop pressing another image video pops feeds ai come better results potential reinvent social media mainly navigation bit sketchy strange certainly interesting parts builders need check would love hear opinions maybe kinds social networks already exist havent seen much minimal tiktok,year interface stop bit

366664, ,
366665,fuck ew,
366666,experienced completely decentralized ao thoughts dao develop well token bring revenue imo dao built around interest contribute order get revenue rather interest contribute order earn tokens token game earn tokens rather develop product projects get revenue even bear market much better base make dao even stronger ,order order tokens tokens product market dao 
366667,makes sense yup ,
366668, 1,
366669,really see reason token well product makes revenue revenue used dao develop project pay salaries even invest projects potentially could increase revenue reduce costs project governance could used nft 1nft 1 vote,product governance nft 
366670,pure revenue stuff never scale enough want grow acquire users go exponentail live 2% margins need create capital credit debt,
366671,otherwise get outrun create,
366672,great thoughts ivan ty share,
366673,agree much stable volatile asset token issued later additional perks base ,
366674,one thing make dao sustainable financial wise always goal 1 another making profits find motivating relevant,
366675,wanna go exponential stay smaller vibes league never make token ,
366676,well successful product built around idea around getting profit ,product 
366677,like social non financial dao,non dao 
366678, 1 teams already token live look alter emission schedule ,
366679,would love add 2 cents came idea dao governed nft holders nft contract owned dao dao controls emissions sales like sort investor board ,nft nft contract dao 
366680,kinda lobsterdao technically speaking ,

366689,could anyone introduce someone wallet connect interested v2,wallet 
366690,since wen non fungible token token issuing nfts token issuance arw reducing supply guess incentivising secondary market fractionalized nfts probably nft governed dao tokenless dao tokenless dao formed wallet addresses way ponderate different commitment members therefore becomes inefficient,non market tokenless tokenless wallet addresses 
366691,agree nfts token case,
366692,one layer abstraction funny cat image,
366693,yes token completely different economics nfts rather made tokens nft like right x z token game earn tokens,tokens tokens 
366694,always problem dao ecosystems conflicts interests high user turnover,dao 
366696,nft personalized know belong want,nft know 
366698,ethereum devs since 2018 like,ethereum 
366699,somehow agree economics part erc20 erc721 technical specifications standards may end result erc20 max supply 10k make non transferable play erc721 minted millions real difference practical terms erc20 meant relevant part economic dynamics plan healthy incentive mechanism incentivize coordination multiple parties different interests one single goal dump neighbour techs mere tools matters essence game dynamic,mechanism dump 
366702,big difference part inflation usually tokens staked get apy annual inflation witch without new users creates sell wall nfts inflated new buyers ,inflation inflation 
366704,think got point tbh nfts staked well want million things staking erc20 erc20 vs erc721 whatever incentive mechanism dynamics design matters anyhow said somehow agree protocol value transfer place incentivize healthy development community ,mechanism protocol

366792,what's point hiding data dapp connect wallet web2 minded devs ,data dapp wallet 
366793,points increase conversion dapps require wallet related data probably easier hide instead mock web2 minded users also angry stupid thing works non power users,points wallet data 
366794,strange merge make lido dao 1 sell ldo low price looks like understand something,dao 
366795,secondary market decided give ldo premium members decide disregard kinda ye indeed sure timing smart also given tokens r liquid ,market tokens 
366796,ftx immediately announced perp listing proposal went live ,proposal 
366798,steth l2 merge best narratives lido,
366799, ,
366800, mostly fugazi like jerking useless math ,
366801,can't imagine scale winter lido sells tokens operations next 2 years people start talking merge,tokens 
366802,merge old news 2 years like 1559,
366803,well know pretty bad timing like founders space need learn chikun eth foundation prepare ship harsh weather,eth 
366804,protocol wait proper conditions market deploy features promised deliver specific time ,protocol market time 
366805,yes date one long awaited event crypto space ,date event crypto 
366806,dumping bags feature ,
366807,talk steth unlocks ldo ,
366808,im talking ldo dunno think der,
366809,sorry get affect winter could please explain,
366810,we're discussing proposal lido dao want sell 2% ldo get money next 2 years looks like preparing winter side merge affect ldo price positive manner,proposal dao money 
366811,oh gotcha thanks explaining see next way huge chance winter rn likely need cash keep operating time otherwise lay stuff also affects market could wrong 2% really dump also ,cash time market 
366812,yeah point founders miss timing selling tokens today environment necessarily represents top something middle lido team probably substratum ,tokens 
366813,talking 2% supply huge amount,
366814,alameda golding lido likely otherwise perps may big holder paid listing ,
366815,previously wanted sell 10k eth dai reason think better dive deeper topics may decided sell ldo instead eth ,eth eth 
366816,anyway considering arguments need pay salaries would situation ,
366817,followed data protocol made amount 30m last year,data protocol year 
366818,looks like make enough money salaries ,money 
366819,eah need research cause metric protocol revenue share staking rewards goes protocol ldo holders node operators ,protocol protocol node 
366820,probably worth requesting better explanation side according straightforward logic highly doubt shady intentions especially considering fact eth foundation closely watching questions decentralization ,eth decentralization 
366821,nothing shady dao sale always look kinda weird time secondary market participants wanted play merge narrative upset demand partly met dao sale pump forever said mean happen money needed proposal made would made 2 weeks ,dao time market dao pump money proposal

366893,hi i'm interested,
366894,delete pdfs permitted google drive link thought might interest people curve enable 'permissionless ' liquidity mining setup pool w factory gauge reward token ask curve approve distribution update user interface otherwise close permissionless also create custom script distributing rewards gauge week b c gauges week week currently using gelato instead chainlink keepers automate works either tool slow steady defi getting autonomous launching new token w liquidity incentives consider curve go governance vote non crv rewards sushiswap onsen balancer bancor rip uniswap xtokenterminal etc problems solve fully decentralized way ,permissionless liquidity mining reward ask distribution interface permissionless defi liquidity governance 
366895,thank positing,
366896,balancer exact thing would curious hear problems solved mind dm'ing,
366897,speaking frankly documentation lbps interesting unclear permissionlessness rewarding x eth pools 3rd token really liked idea changing weighting pools time goal distribute pile tokens buyers directly price discovery create incentive create x token must minted protocol looking reward x eth pools x token w price discovery mechanism x raise eth dao treasury think balancer lbps would primary contender honestly opposed eth lbp w rewards via lbp future curve clearly visible x eth rewards examples like steth eth rewarded ldo made easier coordinate wanted w trying ask something new unheard see examples bal documentation outside lbps fair launch pricing ,eth time tokens token protocol reward eth token mechanism eth dao eth eth eth 
366898,describing possible managed pool available later year lbp designed incentives exist perpetuity noting lbp discussion separate curve cannot lbp's probably fair point may mention 3rd party reward tokens docs i'll look ldo thing balancer's wsteth pool though possible like curve ask us add reward token anyone could add reward token gauge would open attack vectors ,year reward tokens reward reward attack 
366899,yes talked michael curve point add reward needs permission reduce attack vector yeah lbps totally different curve pools reviewed managed pool documentation originally misunderstood boosted pools wanted different balancer great regularly recommend people keep watch managed pools later year consider future projects ,reward attack year 
366900, audere est facere,
366901,would cool easy way avoid attack vectors tbf ideally we'd want remove gating much possible ,attack 
366902,thanks sir,

366913,add reward unverified erc20 approve function secretly calling weth approve bayc approve setapprovalforall similar users claim rewards get scam token try use get drained ,reward function 
366914,help web web3 stuff ser dm maybe find someone network,
366915,smth way reward managers designed general calling random approve fns unverified contracts safe even within context calls approve token actually giving approval anywhere else ,reward 
366916,thanks dm,
366917,sure understanding approve transfer unverified erc20 effectively known contract call inside e g weth transfer victim hacker ,contract e g 
366918,check reward token ask curve soon bal approve reward token verified etherscan fine ,reward ask reward etherscan 
366919,wut,
366920,weth transferfrom victim hacker amt would require approval victim caller case aforementioned erc20 contract ,contract 
366922,ok clarify thought reason permissionless add reward scam token could scam approve msg sender weth approve msg sender amount 2 x scam transfer victim hacker amount weth transfer victim hacker amount weth balance victim could wrong possible though ,permissionless reward 
366926,approve work like,work 
366927,caller one approve,
366928,another calling context,

366943,away get callbacks node whenever new block comes ,node block 
366944,geth websocket subscriptions similar might closest thing,
366945,may easier use etherscan api issues polling blocks simply poll blocks node much easier loose data case,etherscan api data 
366946,ye think zhongfu nailed answer,
366947, shared thoughts spvs better fit financing bottoms tinkering web3 moving us closer capital formation coordination moving speed innovation hoping hear opinions topic evolve thinking ,

367167,hmmm yeah think i'm asking along lines firms like wintermute gsr kraken,
367168,sneg55 said one thing lot coins trade dex's cex's obvious reasons another kyc similar issues deal dex's many different benefits downsides ,
367169,wintermute guys utilizes cex's entirely believe close trades ,

367171,clearpool kind otc pools permissioned pools e x jane street blocktower one ,e 
367172,know trades lending related,
367175,think another reason could except uni v3 dexs based passive lping whereas cexs generally require active market making result cexs tend regularly adapt incorporate new pricing information virtue frequently updating orderbook even trades happening whereas prices produced passive lp dexs less often updated lps passive except uni v3 sense waiting arbitrageurs come push prices back line trading agains pool naturally prices tend lag behind proactive lps actively market make passive lp dexs liquidity lower slippage result trading volume one would expect see larger trades needed update prices accordingly incorporate new pricing information illustrate consider extreme case one cex active mms one passive lp dex infinite liquidity new pricing information clearly rather easy mms update prices somewhat quickly reflected new orderbook state cex however prices dex require infinite trades update pool balances reflect new price attracting infinite trading volume ,market trading market liquidity trading liquidity state trading

367190,best current blockchain node provider deploy token contract ,node contract 
367194, ,
367195,yeah makes sense ie volatility typically causes volume that'd relegated dexs since frequent price differences would mean arbitrage oppurtunities i'm curious would ratio volume btw cex amd dex ever change significantly ,
367196, idk feels passive aggressive ton data sources dex cex trades correlation causality studies know bringing trading bots sandwich attacks ,data trading 
367197,yes exactly higher vol causes arb opportunities dexs also cexs given prevalent passive lping many dexs leads trading volume one would expect effect become pronounced tvl passive lp dexs arb opportunities get bigger arbitrageurs trade bigger sizes agains pools back line paradoxically one could argue higher tvl passive lp dexs actually makes price discovery somewhat slower less efficient need move capital get new pricing info reflected pool balances implied spot prices guess somewhere sweet spot though want meaningful tvl passive lp dexs able absorb normal trade sizes much tvl could actually become detrimental efficient price discovery need lot trading volume keep markets line ,trading trading

367200,tried existing rpc solutions claims provide flashbot protections reality none actually work basic eth rpc much faster txns never get stuck anything tried flashbot eden manifold securerpc txns never go fails ,
367201,issues manifold sambacha might able help,
367202,likely get looked raising github issue manifold,
367204,closing closing speech 2 5h later,
367206,see mean price discovery slower would market wait trade large tvl amm finishes executing seems like market would want price discovery happen speed fastest element ,market market 
367207, ,
367208,yeah maybe word slower ideal meant tend need trading volume dex incorporate new market info compared cex regularly updating orderbook also without trades happening,trading market 
367209, ,
367210,hmmmmm mean token traded amms yes there's really equivalent l2 data amm world yeah incorporate data streams god knows sources long takes maybe already exists speed price discovery would time incorporate l2 like data amms time orders execute token also traded order book exchanges consensus order book price discovery happens amms exist quick liquidity speed price discovery rate happens order books could argue amms aid price discovery would love see reseaech conduct one literature yet even i'd guess speed price discovery speed fastest amm trade bit slower order books moment though ,token data data time data time order consensus order liquidity order bit order 
367211,adding slowness large tvl amms game theory conclusions example pretend 1 order book exchange price discovery happens 2 amms 1 significantly larger tvl would market overall incentives allow arbitrage happen low tvl amms therefore pricing larger arbitrage opourtunities larger tvl amm perhaps easy comparing multiple frequency arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage ,order exchange 
367212,think amms really contribute price discovery little bit point trying make earlier amm passive lps waiting arbitrageurs come adapt amm really taking active role price discovery arbitrageur pushing amm line thereby establish price discovery relates back question might reason increasing trading volume dexs compared cexs think one reason dex amms passive need arbitrageurs adjust new prices entails trading volume order kind update dex amm state amount trading volume needed higher passive lp tvl ,bit trading trading order state trading 
367213,ahaha see point assuming amms adjust price market arbitrage conclusions 1 amm volume course driven volume order books 2 ratio amm volume dex would increase higher volume environment since right much less volume amms approx equal increase absolute volume much higher percentage increase total trading volume amms,market order trading 
367214,yeah interesting also think staleness large tvl pools could potentially find interpreted market signal e lps remain passive accident laziness choice staleness pool gets whole different meaning one might consider deviation compared cex wrong sense cex dex,market e meaning 
367215,going back dashboard shared noticeable bumps volume that's attributed amms that'd suggest amms still found use cases would drive significantly larger volume exchanges prevalent use cases i've seen dapps part amm ecosystem liquidity guys need super high volume trades ,liquidity 
367216,hypothesis would passive tvl dex pool higher vol given asset pair trading volume one might expect see capital kind energy needed flow update dex compared cex markets ,trading 
367217,reading amm papers mega brain team chitra evans angeris last year come opposite conclusion amms simply passive amms hold latent potential space arbs part necessary ecosystem moreover symbiotic relationship two organisms yet fully understood explored price discovery obvious first order effect relationship hints something far complex coming future perhaps amms appear passive today awaiting innovation unlock ,year order 
367218,yeah totally agree referring currently prevalent cfmms excluding uni v3 afaik bigger one moment requiring active lping require arbitrageurs eliminate price discrepancies yeah open amm term also include types amms also even discovered yet guess right ,term 
367219,hmmm worry even claim say cex dex people different views pricing would reason there's incentive trade across two case there's much execution risk dexs ,
367220,yeah agree although depends way lps behave dex example dex lps always passive dex prices always long arbitrageur move back line ,
367221,paper detail complexities would see 2 possible ways amms could add complexities 1 investors execution traders look pricing across venues amms order books otc desks batch auction exchanges etc would certainly impact price discovery happens setting expectation right current pricing amms indirect way contributing price discovery 2 amms used bootstrap liquidity conducting large private transactions la like fashion sizable private investment fashion think already happening degree also links paper ,order liquidity transactions 
367222,octolinker need,
367223,actually guess 3rd innovation complexity first version already implemented uniswap v3 allowing stakers choose price range would like yields think staking positions equivalent l2 data order books someone would rather stake take position market would stakers group incentives discover prices efficient way left answered amms figure catch 2 birds price discovery easy liquidity that'd breakdown current paradigm easy liquidity vs price discovery,data order market liquidity liquidity 
367224,several papers propose range payoff functions mathematically possible also allude end linked paper future work complex financial products discovered seriously favour read last 12 months papers guys wrote arxiv ,work

367538,curiosity possible create something like gpt3 dall e blockchain using decentralized processors like render something obstructions ,e blockchain 
367539,decentralised data storage processing power magnitudes expensive ,data 
367540,models hundreds gb,
367541,like adjust costs infrastructural deficiencies blockchain comes creating similar models ,
367542,think maybe 100s tbs,
367543,depends want tbh decentralized model training decentralized execution ,
367544,look federated learning ways training part,
367545,open source code decentralized processing incentives data knowledge providers,source data 
367547,there's alrdy open source models train,source 
367548,well open data sets,data 
367549,ig could set market get training data per datum evaluation useful model training seems like would best greatly increase training time,market data time 
367550,think even dall e codex github co pilot trained open source data sets,e source data 
367551,decentralized processing mean different service provider runs model time ,time 
367552,something like render ,
367553,sry i'm familiar link ,
367554, ,
367556,honestly idk there's need decentralized model thinking loud,
367557,ever stopped projects ,
367558,i'm familiar enough economics someone comment pricing competitive aws ,
367559,projects ,
367560,dentacoin,

367562, going put medical records blockchain data ,data 
367563,yeah thinking lines,
367564,time design gives leverage donate data research anonymously earning incentives,time data 
367565,ex ,
367566,decentralized ,
367567,seems rly far fetched ngl avg price individual user data prolly cents sure commodifying lead higher prices,data 
367568,reads like run mill render farm business token,
367569,think anyone leverage gpu network yeah permissionless,permissionless 
367570,research labs spend thousands get data sometimes yeah every kind data going highly priced mostly focused utility,data data 
367571,call aws decentralized use follow rules would ,
367572,set gpu setup aws ,
367573,that's point analogy,
367574,maybe framed wrong,
367575,back origin q hand think decentralized model training still infancy pay compute results often less competitive top models quite large compute scale large need high requirements nodes end result rly much better,
367576,yeah wanted discuss points failure system created chain,points system chain 
367577,also decentralization w r servers anyone provide gpus rendering single entity controlling network yeah infra specific protocols debated,
367578,unless they're hiding something single entity definitely controlling network business ,

367620,going build il based straddles strangles though care trading events might become interesting,trading 
367621,ohh nice also issue liqudity mostly exists btc eth many events predictable vol shocks 2 however many long tail tokens thinking ways pull short atm straddle like payoff via uni v3 lp positions usdc pair token,btc eth tokens usdc 
367622,checklist sophistication,
367623,yeah going uni v2 first makes liquidity much available basically assume amm lps already selling vol buyers leveraged buy il turn straddle seller also go leveraged short ,liquidity

367638,agree v3 gives flexibility eventually want concentrated,
367639,ya better plenty sophisticated players less people covered cheeto dust punting btc options couch less external unpredictable events try price iv strange way crypto somewhat boring,btc 
367640,less unknowns less volume less opportunity,
367641,education sure example trade perps 3 4x leverage sell options get returns massive theta funding rate,
367642,eh,
367643,reason trade options outlook iv,
367644,i'd say unknowns tho ,

367655,otpauth even better asymmetrical keys strictly better thank totp server also knows secret use yubikey possible ,
367656,phone rooted android access 2fa seeds unlikely apply people,
367657,many reasons buy atm call longing perp want bet direction 1 hedged downside liquidation 2 added benefit long gamma get timing right,
367658, vasa dev ser reason gem bulk sender unverified contract ,contract 
367659,never understood whole liquidation thing difference making sub account 100 putting 100 atm option,
367660,long gamma leverage almost exact perps,

367733,working making limited form options need supply interest rates collateral,
367734,works straddles strangles start,
367735,interesting talk we're building resonate expect produce large supply liquid interest rate exposures,
367736,would work would take benchmark interest rate ,
367737,presume solution requires principal ,
367738,based il fairly easily build delta neutral long gamma position pockets il liquidated anything interest rate simulates theta ,
367739,real bumper would provide swaps collateralisation choice stablecoins biggest issue insti peg risk provide exposure fixed interest rate without requiring collateral stablecoins could interesting,
367740,definitely want make interests market based,market

367872,ah nevermind found,
367873,think readable contract right ,contract 
367874,hey wondering projects store addresses db mixed vs lowercase either lowercase everything use case insensitive search time ,addresses time 
367875, using postgres specifically case ,
367876,guess postgres trigger auto lowercase could work already lower case unique indexes,
367877,still annoying queries feel like shouldnt annoying handle,
367878,row level triggers good usecase care performance add check constraint change wherever save data,data 
367879,rust projects usually create intermediate type serves binding code db code stored dbs native type code translate,type type 
367880,ya guess we'll done till annoying,
367882,write checksum addresses always query checksum addresses,addresses addresses 
367883,gets hard deal values certain address like topics logs,address 
367884, ,
367887,hi guys find famous bridge aggregator w public api recommend ,api 
367888, otpauth even better authy autificator otp totp exact hotp timestamp,
367889,diched youbekey favor authy well due versatiliy simplicity fact easy several devices redundancy ,
367890,ah probably meant specific app named otpauth bad ,
367891,yes meant app,
367892,1password even better,
367893,also already yubikey supports totp auth top yubiotp u2f pgp blah blah ,
367894,add existing totp google authenticator etc codes yubikey generate totp codes without totp secrets leave yubikey,
367895,nfc yubikey get codes someone elses' android ios phone,
367896,authy pretty shitty app,
367898,yeah improve lot apps freezes every time open,time 
367899,use separate android device internet access aegis open sourced app good functionality back without emails shit like,open 
367900,2fa codes phone lot apps wrong first place ,
367901,seems like might've meant lot accounts ,
367902,hm ok experience freezing tbh many accounts try transfer data authy new device surprise doesnt allow retrieve original code aegis example convenient ,data 
367903,smart would always use separate android device password storage pen paper whats go ,
367904,keypass ofc,
367905,current computer ,
367906,separately stored encrypted usb stick back another usb stick ,
367907,making things complicated make loose shit day,
367908,lost online accounts much complicated opsec,
367909,yep happened complicating security find right balance good organization system ,organization system 
367910,would suggest everything create visualization mindmap maybe write stuff security can't really,
367911,authy good hacks authy ,
367912,think would matter default authy 2fa account tokens stored locally ,tokens 
367913,problem default authy allows mobile device access phone number associated authy account download access private keys account somebody uses social engineering access phone could problem change settings,
367914,think option disabled,
367915,yes said default,
367916,install authy iphone android,
367917,one goes missing find another phone install,one 
367918,one backup,
367919,might need dig better solution though like yubikey idea,
367920,really use authy i'm much help others might know better generally sounds good ,
367921,yea i'm researching yubikey rn,
367922,what's best authenticator among,
367923,authy convenient carrying yubikey around,
367924,using authy yubikey,
367925,authy stupid account yubikey important acc google twitter etc,twitter 
367926,call overcomplication mentioned pretty simple basic opsec nothing special,
367927,think best see list top recommended point sometimes preference also depends secure really want adding separate layers like early mentioned using separate android w internet connection ,

368082,yeap completely makes think haydens thread jit coincidence maybe saw one coming ,
368083,auto compounding gut imho tho read part docs jit part ,

368293,kinda either situation tho either dapps step actively put work oracles go easy way choose managed service sorry shill currently working making types available get immutable data feed need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc get managed service la chainlink read eth usd without caring happens underneath think people go immutable stuff care enough believe majority industry simply gravitate towards easier use ,work data source eth usd 
368295,could use chain oracles based amms get bad rep people bother implement flash loan guardrails b often much less liquidity honeypot none like insurmountable issues,chain liquidity 
368296,thanks let see think gonna people put thought oracles even tho one important parts setup ,
368298,maybe things actually build without feel somewhat groundbreaking,
368299,assumes want prices tho data types ,data 
368300,stuff necessarily trade chain ,chain 
368301,great paper twap oracle attacks easier done said might find interesting ,oracle 
368302,well need external servers validators anyway point cl good,
368304,think difference made people running nodes cl multisig rug everything course network diverse bigger names participating change fact cl multisig point price aggregator somewhere completely else without timelock whatsoever ,
368305,good long multisig allows ,
368307, get immutable data feed need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc mean anything relying cannot immutable ,data source 
368308,welcome dilemma choose want immutability ,immutability 
368309,title bit catastrophistic considering criticism kind average used twaps haha think fair paper though bit truism point every attack every blockchain expense vs reward numbers mentioned manipulating 2m pool fee low,bit bit attack blockchain reward low 
368310,know there's dilemma much problem implementation really need something like uniswap everything automated human tweaking ux chainlink,
368311,like liquity build closed loop never changeable end using cl tellor fall back anything ever happens fucked immutability oracle level means need good ways ensure ability change oracles get abused still designed way act hoc ,immutability oracle 
368312,see happening yet,
368313,well yeah go back point chain prices want use chainlink send custom queries care much aggregation tech,chain 
368314,custom queries meaning ,
368315,send arbitrary http requests network,
368316,yeah really aggregation tho simply using api request ,api 
368317,yeah need control aggregation implement fine cl handling deets,
368318,far cl defender service people use,
368319,aggregate pass value chain trust tho ,chain trust 
368320,oracle give assurances fetched correct value,oracle 
368321,beyond much,
368322,meh debatable yeah tldr coiner wrote ,
368323,idk feels like spectrum debate chainlink leaning heavily ux basically runs like web2 company making decentralized loses flexibility ux doubt trade avoided,
368324,stick oracleizing network provide generalized interface data retrieval ,interface data 
368325,ocr save gas pretty sure cl aggregation chain also polkadot pretty much use nodes retrieve data stuff chain,gas chain data chain 
368326,thanks create dune dashboard paid ,
368327,also paper also focuses uni v2 twaps different animal forms including v3,
368328,hmm interesting sure alt l1s default seems like pretty easy win get rid chainlink middleman,
368329,yeah think anyone recommending blindly use uni v2 twap also fun fact latest inverse hack basically caused disregarding chain prices blindly trusting cl,chain 
368330,hm good question polkadot think anyone used serious capacity yet parachains quite primitive also tbh half stuff barely works stage ,capacity 
368331,also devs lazy want implement oracles lol,
368333,nvim way,
368335,forked aave xdai code base complicated open source front end back either,source

368772,instead attaching whole onchain reputation one wallet across multiple wallet onchain activities one wallet comprise one wallet zero sum game ,wallet wallet wallet wallet 
368773,yeah non transferable key called sbt else defeats purpose,
368774,probably move nft avenue,nft 
368775,movable consensus immovables sake recovery,consensus 
368776,sbts restricted nfts ,
368777,restricted ,
368778,ok,
368779,nah okay imho continue,
368780,meant looking sbts nfts rather chain pops across sectors,chain 
368781,chain pops ,chain 
368782, poaps,
368783,untransferable poaps,
368784,yep,
368785,seem make little sense token types ,
368786,said yet special sbts apart bloody untransferable poaps yet many hype like magical concept bloody muh fugazi naming,
368787,like kids get stars work kindergarden,work 
368789,perfect character progression system use case 1,system 
368790,feel make sense defi small flash loans bases past credit history,defi 
368791,perfect reputational avatar systems supercharged creator economy use case 2,
368792,that's fugazi,
368793,makes sense blz rephrase,
368794, flash loan reputation ,
368795,fugazi af,
368797,low duration loans meant think undercollateralized low duration loans,
368798, perfect supercharged creator economy like point advantages technical level ,
368799,yeah kind,
368800,would wanna sell character point oulala make character things movable get upgradeable nfts sbt ,
368801,yeah everything soulbound gonna economy meant like rpg style items can't transferred natural way implement like transferable items lock transfer function seems like small change create whole branding ,function 
368802,soulbound pseudo magical high tech aesthetic basic concept,
368803,anyone know good blogs blockchain gaming theses ,
368804,tbh feel like sbt fans pushing new shiny crap throat fancy name unless literally say yes like fancy term totally fine say untransferable nfts like poaps cannot move tweet tech sbt either ,term 
368805,omfg many times share docs talks stop dismissing without giving second thought,
368806,frustrating,
368807, good overview,
368808,read docs legitimately see what's big deal ,
368809,sure implement something like branding making nfts non transferable groundbreaking technical conceptual leap imho,
368810,mean literally sbt name ,
368811,i've come bunch blockchain gaming theses curious see what's thinking real use case web3 gaming aligning incentives players spectators devs investors streamers pros roblox warcraft like platforms user generated content skirting regulation betting bootstrapping users cold start problem token emissions interoperability defi protocols making gaming assets productive might meme tihnk axie stepn web3 runescape stuff great,interoperability defi 
368812,anyone thinks stuff please dm would love talk 1 year creating stealth web3 moba launch beta want meet interested people,year 
368813,people act like sbts nfts nfts fungible tokens far they're literally nfts can't move ,fungible tokens 
368814,ty ,
368815,yes true use sbt name vitalik made popular even though sbt2 prod 7 months longer post can't reach people even 100k dropped marketing unless piggyback trends we've found,
368816,totally fine btw everyone likes shiny new terms problem larpers try fundraise shill sbt tech something new also said untransferable nfts live months,
368817,without sbts possible scenario around ages used magical shiny term make shit game better bad incentives better scamraise maybe ,term 
368818,degenscore good example,
368819,think name lame i'd support anyone trying leverage name goes well users signal boosters investors,
368820,yep 100% agree implemented originally discussed bound wallet done proper nesting becomes something else actually becomes closer actual soulbound wow implemented way vitalik block transfer way mean,wallet block 
368821,thanks good know ,
368822,actually nice examples docs,
368823,thanks helpful ,
368824, swader would non transferable nfts able moved onto bitcountry parachain via xcm opens useful properties metaverse,
368825,sure new tech port another chain need bit complex contracts architecture trivial ,chain bit 
368826,sure port surely omni chain whatever cool kids calling nfts killer feature say nft kusama represents reputation dick cool kusama transfer across ethereum reputation comes obvious example might credit score nft allows lower collaterized rate aave ,chain nft ethereum 
368827,nfts make sense wrapped assets like erc20,
368828,imagine atomic transfer nfts pretty killer feature,
368829,yes easy bridgeless transfer also huge selling point super pimped reputational avatar looks good also one stop shop defi chain app read info reliably quickly enough give something like undercollat loan,stop defi chain 
368830,docs look great ser explore soon ,
368831,there's project kusama giving people trophies every chain referendum vote people equip onto shelf project read cool looking shelf give perks,chain 
368832,anyone think happens nfts get pow eth fork understand defi stables oracles etc etc part stick pos chain function nfts different story really need liquidity pool much anything exist sure argument made provenance etc anyways curious thoughts ,pow eth fork defi pos chain function liquidity provenance 
368833,let know question,
368834,dm sure looks like building great stuff,
368835,guess would minter declare canonical version,
368836,centralized stables defi whatever protocols tap like opensea looksrare gem genie sudo go away real ones defi get purists like etc people back days nft people retail understanding behind click interfaces ,defi defi nft 
368837,v1 vs v2 cryptopunks stuff gives insight arguments made saying nfts chains priced native eth pow nfts worth less although see going extent wrapping using word v loosely bridging pos chain making claims provenance head scratcher see defo debate opportunity v least,eth pow pos chain provenance 
368838,ez convince nft ppl pos energy narrative,nft pos 
368839,would disagree stable issuer say coin collateralised done extent say chain support project completely different imo,coin chain 
368840,kinda said tho issuers decide,
368841,issuer nft ,nft 
368842,still narrative that's pushed thought fizzled heard,
368843,retail normies got washed one pushing,
368844,think early give specific definition precisely soulbound concept somehow related digital reputation primary use case partnered degenscore make continuously updating nfts reflecting chain achievements find sbts like projects blog unfortunately following kusama's ecosystem closely forgot mention projects ,chain 
368845,hmm thought first soulbond nft private key ,nft key 
368846,we'll we're evm,
368847,also ppl wants retail normies come back new ones join wait pos especially work artists something focus quite bit,pos

368851,list meetups sf nyc ,
368852,agree first take set token nft non transferrable think required whitepaper,nft non 
368853,however thinking came interesting idea basically allows permanently mark wallet address ,wallet address 
368854,building stablechain we're trying minimize state growth maintain decentralization want limit number accounts state idea 2 kinds accounts persistent non persistent persistent accounts work like normal accounts non persistent accounts receive normally soon send zero account gets destroyed sbts limited pass persistent accounts,state decentralization state non 
368855,guys think good idea nah ,
368856,makes sense,
368857,new chain x reason basically abandoning everything 24 7 mechanism makes possible,chain mechanism

368859,documented docs rmrk app origin page,
368860,excellent thanks ,
368861,man,
368862,got idea reading article stopanddecrypt,

368870,first get users worry nonexistent problems dont,
368871,getting users real problem solve problem dont ,
368872,controlling growth seems weird,

368896,kinda mixing days i'll keep mum,
368899,ne happens everyone else message nothing new one yesterday got purged mistake news yet ,
368900,completely agree users give network value trying learn mistakes made chains us really value decentralization state size something fixed problem becomes apparent ,decentralization state 
368901,yeah agree well see chain solves trying,chain 
368902,want sell macbook created seed delete everything disk utility reinstall macos safe enough sell destroy ,seed 
368903,pretty sure fine rather destroying macbook better move assets brand new wallet new seed ,wallet seed 
368904,microwave shit change wallets,
368905,applications write zeros memory erase content deleting files usually actually delete changes small part memory tells os file 100% fool proof regions memory get worn time get written basically preserve selling machine might well treat private key compromised moving assets new address would likely best ,file proof time machine key address 
368906,macos filevault encryption also turned still compromised delete vol recreate paranoid general want get closer reality ,
368907,group one really turned encryption anything think nft kingdom,nft 
368908,time seed already encrypted application level filevault adds another layer delete volume good,time seed application 
368909,ayo kek,
368910,u delete disk utility startup screen fresh install reinstall difference safe,
368911,personally instead selling mac keep offline crypto module buy new one personal,
368912,sure though disk encrypted slightly better position paranoia would definitely make sense store assets hardware wallet direct manufacturer seed phrase never leave device transactions create hot wallet transfer subset tokens accept bad shit happen ,seed phrase transactions wallet tokens 
368913,underrated,
368914, yeah regarding file vault every time u fresh install macos creates new set keys rendering old set useless anyways ,file time

368936,thanks trouble one i'm thinking swapr ,
368937,ok helps thank,
368938,swapr makes sense look erc 20 transactions tab owner ,transactions 
368939,would check contact code first deployer contract name dxswaprouter,contract 
368940,yes swapr eth made dxdao originally called dxswap eth,eth eth 
368943,etherscan internet,etherscan 
368945,yep,
368946,good wanted make sure wasnt shitty internet,
368948, also try otterscan pretty awesome,
368949,hey guys anybody point solid reading material stables work w merge ,
368950,hey thought would share report wrote merge impact capital flows mev miners forks ,
368951,nothing stables fundamentally operate change post merge along every contract currently use affects overall stablecoin market terms positive market outlook different question debate ,contract stablecoin market market 
368954,anyone knows way export wallets created particular seed metamask eg json,seed 
368955,way create new wallets without reinstalling metamask ,
368956,buying new computer,

368958,sure understand ,
368959,current wallet generate addresses use seedphrase,wallet addresses 
368960,generate new wallet,wallet 
368961,mean metamask wallet,wallet 
368962,import new private key want new generation need change base seed phrase metamask uses yes reinstall ,key generation seed phrase 
368963,damn,
368964,using different browser work,work 
368965,create new profile browser open metamask profile,
368967,yep tbh,

368980,wonder stables work fork pow can't possibly double amount value holding ethereum assets get duplicated pos merge pow fork guess stables fork probably lose value also interrogation mark regarding oracles work forked net,work fork pow ethereum pos pow fork fork work 
368981,nothing work unless everything stays pow binary outcome,work pow 
368982, ivangbi group ever host voice calls,

369002,system designed way take much put overall make per day use night ,system 
369003,hey ser may ask one well,
369004,yeah pretty much way work stablecoin issuer decide chain honor redemptions,work stablecoin chain 
369005,stablecoins could work chains simultaneously would 100% eth backed stablecoins imo course would need functioning oracle,eth oracle 
369006,lusd 100% eth backed think last checked ,eth 
369007,yes,
369008,impression 110% eth stand corrected,eth 
369009,sorry meant haha mean collateral ratio meant type collateral,type 
369011,definitely overcollateralized,
369012,eth collateral functioning oracle pow fork lusd could still value,eth oracle pow fork 
369013,aaah got seemed ,
369014,nice nice good find ,
369015,hmm wonder worth holding lusd similar stables going merge hopes fork,fork 
369016,oracle support pow fork bet,oracle pow fork 
369017,question pow eth would valued 2 3% pos eth much would lusd worth pow network 2 3 cents ,pow eth pos eth pow 
369018,yeah true unless started similar pricing gave time lusd redemptions collateral value backing would get smoker,time 
369019,even could get something nothing,
369020,said nothing change mean like underlying mechanism achieve stability altered well contracts macro outlooks merge well possibility pow fork affect i'm sure debate agree tho yes quite likely assets pow fork chain become worthless esp since exchanges willing prepped accept assets,mechanism pow fork pow fork chain 
369021,option military grade erase drive content utility disk,
369022,friend faced almost successful attack anyone experienced ,attack 
369023, case attack new malicious metamask like browser tab asking check insert recovery phrase double tripple checks action ,attack phrase 
369024,attack old people usually experience trying google dapps clicking phishing link,attack 
369025,captcha bot nft discord btw,nft 
369026,anyway think giga caution avoid attacks keeping mind metamask ask seed phrase one time basically use seed phrase one time new devices,seed phrase time seed phrase time 
369029,idk okay ask like product questionnaires ,product

369210,much drained ,
369211,lots,
369212, ,
369213,good point,
369214,yes afaik connext using nomad assets liquidity network example bridging ethereum evmos,liquidity ethereum 
369215,liquidity evmos probably unbacked,liquidity 
369216,xpollinate connext team nomad ,
369219,ironically evmos pumped 20% people sell synth assets unbacked ,
369220,trading 1 8 1 5 hack,
369221,devs vacation maybe,
369222, ,
369223,nomad connext big friends,
369224,nomad ui actually advertise connext quicker solution thought shared liquidity,liquidity 
369225, ,
369226,one send rescued funds back ,
369227,yep theyre working together,
369228,150,
369229,keeping safer sending nomad team ,
369230, julrach,
369231, ,
369232,let ask,
369233,wait comms official account imo,
369234,able rescue small amount seeing transactions think others lot send back that's i'm asking setup address could send back whatever amount able save ,transactions address 
369235, ,
369236, ,
369237,bridge already empty,
369238,wow ,
369239,whole point optimistic bridges high latency security reasons,
369240,think rari capital exploiter might made,
369241,rug took hour nothing done,
369242,negative 1 6,
369243,frrr wtf devs sleepy,
369244,rich devastating thing happen team sure devs traumatised didnt stop probably couldnt,
369245,although sure usdc wasnt frozen guess would wait autopsy,
369246,glmr chain paused last tx 52 minutes back friend able anything even though knew exploit ,chain 
369247,fundraise 22m hard expand team improve quality code ,
369248,yeah mostly curious happened dumb typo kind bug genius keccak spoofing thingy,
369249,compound billion dollar protocol big treasury still got hacked devs probably blame easy raise 22 woe betide,dollar protocol 
369250,apparently could reuse successful bridging receipts,
369251,hey sam long time see,time 
369252,yo your'e penguin glad made transition kek,
369253,bounty 1m 150m worth crypto ,bounty crypto 
369254, ,
369255,pause chain ,chain 
369256,right hackers jumped seeing exploit ,
369257,trying find evmos could dump native assets,
369258,weeks ago,
369260,never released statement bridge related,
369261,dot cosmos catch break,
369262,simply replacing address calldata message get validated could per address lots people jumped,address address 
369263,fr,
369264, ,
369265,lets quit speculating leader speaks,
369266,sorry see paused period ,
369267,tx since 1 hr 2 mins tx going,
369268,yeah sure pausing blockchain even accomplishes anything unless fine keeping paused week takes sort partially ,blockchain 
369269,quite astonishing i'm really new hackers see methods hacker using blockchain ,blockchain 
369270,cause funds definitely white hatted question much long takes retrieve,
369271,looked couple 'exploit' transactions calldata basically every time except destination address that's probably spread,transactions time address 
369272,yeah waiting official nomad address send towards,address 
369273,thanks insight ,
369274,arjun connext we're fast execution liquidity layer nomad connext currently use nomad rails yet users connext directly affected said mad assets obviously risk routers provide liquidity xchain transactions holding madassets moonbeam milkomeda evmos reached routers approx 75 mins ago let know disable support chains protects folks sending mad assets get native assets another chain however there's nothing done madassets already held routers currently approx 3 3m ,liquidity liquidity transactions chain 
369275,unless plan place big doubt 171m supply 80m borrow moonwell fi,doubt 
369276,liquidity borked already,liquidity 
369277,yeah unless return enough repeg assets gonna insta dump 0 moment turn blockchain,dump blockchain 
369278,yeah likely late anyway,
369279,interesting still producing blocks 0 txs wonder executed,
369280,substrate magic guess,
369281,moonbeam deal lot borking upgrades think stopping blockchain pretty established drill,blockchain 
369282,think glmr team total much liquid assets moonwell dapp funds gone purposes sorry speculation frustrated,dapp 
369283,yea stopping blockchains show reliable decentralised uncorrupted oh irony,
369284,lolz decentralisation worth 200 guess,
369285,ty dont know missed lol,
369286, ,
369287,moonwell could another victim blindly using chainlink tbh get cheap bridge assets supply system counts full price stopping blockchain may least prevented drain native assets,system blockchain 
369288,moonwell drained,
369289,whole chain operated nomad assets moonbeam pushing everyone choice partner wont go bridges ,chain 
369290,moonbeam save mess indirectly created forcing projects use nomad assets ,
369291,bears stressing nomad far strongest economic security model bridge construction however system vulnerable implementation risk ,system 
369292,last byte different,
369293,forcing projects use nomad assets far better recreating risk something like ronin horizon,
369294,well clearly far better,
369295,rollups also hacked way ,
369296,would argue stop building rollups go sidechains small validator sets instead ,
369297,many different types security risks ,
369298,get saying levering unproven software also obvious risks,
369299,contracts audited 1m immunefi security bounty long time adopted moonbeam,bounty time 
369300,everything built space unproven software,
369301,aave 8 9 fig sleeping vuln last year,year 
369302,secure development constricting attackable surface area surface area never zero ,
369303,nomad protects ronin horizon style attacks root trust compromised also protects large category implementation issues example near rainbowbridge uses optimistic model like nomad stopped potentially massive attack watchers noticed attack disconnected bridge however case attack come transactions went bridge exploit contracts ethereum means watcher model halts system event something goes wrong able utilized ,trust attack attack attack transactions ethereum system event 
369305,break glass procedures need standardized defi always fail safe switch,defi 
369306,nice service would mev replayer aggressively frontruns tx results stolen money trivial thing sure get tons funding usage,money 
369307,interesting thanks though always impression nomad months old given tech complexity unreasonable think needed time proven,time 
369308,require disabled 'disabled ' line somewhere pretty much every contract external transactions starts give power ton people break require governance un break better someone abuses power halt protocol stuff like happen unabated ,contract transactions governance protocol 
369309,already generalised front runners probably front ran attacker's transaction,transaction 
369310,remeber first transaction lost 350k fees failed transaction,transaction transaction 
369311,actually true better action sneak pause ,
369312,whole audit ,
369313,artcile pvp santiago palladino played white hack pretyy interesting,
369314,something explicitly centralized,
369315, tldr write another bot try front run attacker dark forest,
369316,layerzero precrime likely helps ,
369317, ,
369318,original dark forest post ,
369319,short term perhaps really long ownership power given dao dao choosing agents emergency powers exercise necessary people misbehave dao remove ,term dao dao dao 
369320,layer zero using chainlink anywhere calling trustless 100% honest,trustless 
369321,sense system dependent dao hyperstructure suppose ,system dao 
369322,that's misdirection substance,
369323,saying dao control whether contracts work centralization ,
369324,mean prety dope tech implicit trust assumption oracle relayer regardless whetther colluding,trust oracle 
369325,yes,
369326,okay different definitions centralization describing hyperstructure granted think even uniswap would fit definition since fee switch,
369327,hyperstructure meta hyperstructure shareholders,
369328,saying otherwise ,
369329, ,
369330, eth hero,eth 
369331,could someone share link ethsecurity tg chat ,
369332,nomad exploiter ,
369333,exploited lot addresses one turned whitehat,addresses 
369334, daos best rehash shares onchain practice much worse name complete misnomer one would unironically call companies shareholders decentralized virtue shareholders yet people space somehow convinced there's magic decentralization juice onchain replica concept,decentralization 
369335,dumb typo ,
369336, ,
369337,well that's fortunate least still believe bridges ticking time bombs ,time 
369338,smart contract bug tho seems ,contract 
369339,whitehat fact ,
369340,yeah clear actually explicitly initialize zero failed initialize solidity ,solidity 
369341,tech super complex dependencies minimal sig verification ,
369342,implementation risk custody economic risk,custody 
369344,dpos upcoming synapse chain add ,chain 
369345,sure follow bone contention isnt implementation havnet code apparent mispreprentation,
369346,complexity,
369347,gather using optimistic verification staking top slashed bad actors,
369348,oh agree sorry clear,
369349,normal optimistic verification already slashing,
369350,synapse model chain acts hub dapps deploy effect makes synapse chain aggregator users deploy synapse chain turn interact chain contrast nomad connext point point means devs deploy anywhere dapps interact chain ,chain chain chain chain chain 
369351, ,

369367,bork defi moonbeam evmos,defi 
369368, tfw hacker read audit,
369369,could exploited one chain could exploited another unless i'm missing point ,chain 
369371,impacted moonbeam moonwell nomad main bridge glmr ,
369372,tweet incorrect,

369374,stopped transactions maintenance ,transactions 
369375,tfw hacker made audit,
369376,claiming samczsun wrong hack worked could explain work ,work 
369377,i'm saying fatmanterra's tweet incorrect,
369378,attack different similar 100%,attack 
369380,root initialized improperly routine upgrade ,
369382,audit warn would process unintialised root actually initalised set 0x00,
369383,except tweet literally discusses cause exploit zero valued leaf prove function sure cause identical verying leaf bytes32 0 would prevented exploit ,function 
369384,listened quantstamp recommended happened needed require leaf bytes32 0 'err' edit wrong ty sam,
369385,hmm see coming solidity dont intilaise value set 0,solidity 
369386,white hat recovered 1m lol,
369387,real question deployment config changed ,
369388,say definitively bet lot 1m whitehated,
369389,house use custom errors thank much,
369390,saw one case verified,
369391,1 secure expense latency without trading ux security delta 1 pos may wide enough justify use cases certainly beauty tradeoffs ,pos 
369392,fine 'er031' refuse use revert looks ugly,
369393,that's bug,
369395,touch two teams native token recovered going official redistribution plan whitehat tokens shall arrange return funds ,token tokens 
369396,think see getting root leaf ,
369397,nomad exploit ,
369398,yes proving message hash 0 done much think would impressive found something hashed zero,hash think 
369399, generate collisions hashing zero please tell create2 hashes zero ,
369400,kneel ,
369401, apparently outside threat model ser,
369402,totally different thing,
369403,wants deploy contract addy 0,contract addy 
369404,use exploit contracts zero address validation functions like acceptownership etc ,address 
369405,case transferfrom oz erc721 implementation ,

369407,would need private key address 0 ,address 
369408,looks like hacker generated valid msg bridge tx,
369409,via create2 simply need salt hash output address obviously still impossible keccak broken would also break nearly ecrecover operations rely hash input one directional ,hash address hash 
369410,todo list monetising testnet eth yes looking kusama,testnet eth 
369411,circumvent latency tradeoff without introducing custody risk using fast execution liquidity layer connext ,custody liquidity 
369412,yep ,
369413,work getting nomad team,work 
369414,appreciated ,
369415,power pause glmr ,
369416,folks whitehatted nomad please get touch julrach cc marco paladin1,
369417, enough liquidity receiving chain yes else use nomad,liquidity chain 
369418,30 min latency window 48 cycles refresh per day liq means w 50m liquidity 2 4b daily volume additionally latency slowly creep start running liq easy track redirect liq real time ,liquidity time 
369420,thanks arjun arranging certainly appreciated ,
369421,julrach tbh i'm messenger ,
369426,whitehat feel free dm,
369428,would nice something public whitehats something would turn hackers whitehats ,
369429,open suggestions right working creating recovery procedures,
369430,going jail already good news whitehat,
369431,would cool immunefi created generalized process,
369432,collecting funds etc ,
369433,though quite bit dmg done bad whitehats probably smart incentivize much ,bit 
369434,interesting find team solve problem ,
369436,mostly thinking people money wallets thinking using case public 5 10% bounty people could instead return claim bounty ,money bounty 
369437,cant really hard fork usdc dai wbtc ethereum ,fork usdc ethereum 
369438,sure think let's see team handles,
369440,best luck julrach,
369441,whitehats would like return frax fxs eth mainnet back frax protocol feel free dm questions asked 10% total funds recovered instant bounty also documentation reference 10% clean admirable exemplary funds without go tornado hassle ,eth mainnet protocol bounty 
369442,ever exploration using native usdc conduit create synthetic positions rather bridging example want bridge eth avalanche mint value via circle avalanche creates synthetic eth position avalanche bls remind i'm dumb,eth eth 
369443,frax nomad ,
369444,frax native moonbeam,
369445,10%,
369446,circle accept function without kyc similar ,function kyc 
369447,upgrade set contract creation,contract 
369449,circle 100% kyc business afaik ,kyc 
369450,i'm using one example,
369451,create synth eth position though ,eth 
369452,would usdc avax point ,
369453,i'm trying create eth avalanche example without bridging assets,
369454,trying use perps,
369455,feels like possible,
369456,synthetix style might pair avax curve help maintain peg sorts,
369457,sort i'm thinking,
369458,sounds like lending ,
369459,sort perp,
369460,mean get eth exposure usdc indeed using collateral chain futures straight swapping eth e ,chain futures eth e 
369461,guess depends want long eth issue synthetic eth via collateralised usdc vault cases lot platforms exist ,eth eth 
369462,could create curve pool spot vs perp maybe,
369463, julrach sent long dm list things right know hectic time please go,time 
369464,solves price exposure part solve fractured liquidity part eth eth wanna buy smth avax funds avax avax native synth help,liquidity eth eth 
369465,lets u get eth ethereum avalanche without bridging ,eth ethereum 
369466,perp also comes lending certain extent funding rate ,
369467,unless different model mind,
369468,straightforward less risky approach would still something similar stablecoin protocol maker liquity issuing synthetic eth,stablecoin protocol eth 
369469,correct,
369470,yeh,
369472,could lending protocol provide eth ethereum borrow whatever want remote chain,protocol eth ethereum chain 
369473,cross chain messaging possible,chain 
369474,could also pure credit based approach little direct backing mint syneth directly lending protocols offer lower interest rate borrows curve pool peg,
369475,issuer would still taking lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc ,
369476,roughly security model bridge tho,
369477,bridges,
369478,requires alrdy assets avax understand correctly ,
369479,yeah starting point avalanche issuance synth assets order avoid bridges,order 
369480, probably bridge risk pairing curve,
369481,that's goal use circle conduit,
369482,la wbtc,
369483,mean objective custodian behind custody eth full instead using usdc,custody eth 
369484,usdc euroc ethc,usdc 
369485,aave v3 ,
369486,way native assets eth would allow borrow avax instance ,eth 
369487, ,
369488,hope ok happened really sad ,
369489,what's total impact hack amm pairs loosing value solvency lending protocols etc ,
369490,know feature looks promising ,
369491,considering relies bridges end different still ,
369492,btw integrated bridges yes ones scuzi look info,
369493,using chainlink,
369494, crosschain lending borrowing ,
369495,chainlink assets magically chains wdym ,
369496,assets magically chains,
369497,asset x chain borrow asset chain b,chain chain 
369498,chainlink allows track transmit data crosschain,data 
369499,might missed happens exploiters consolidate money doxxed addy eg poison dao style ref nomad ,money addy dao 
369500,actually chainlink allow assets magically chains went ccip prez ,
369501, ,
369503,asking price feeds thanks coine r,
369504,talking price feed,
369506,ah crap thank dumb,
369507, ,
369508,got lost messages wow ,
369509,connext uses aave portals well risk regardless whether use perp loan asset whatever need send message across chains controls mint unlock functionality message subject security risks there's lot different dumb narratives around fundamentals change ,
369510,whitehat 1 million frax 2 5 million usdc he's looking email id contact ,usdc

369513,cc ncerovac zhongfu cryptographic ,
369514,honor bounty dm ,bounty 
369515,protocol audited ethereum expand polygon arbitrum etc think get another audit original audit suffice ,protocol ethereum 
369516,case seems like audit must done time deploy sc ok default 0 initial root deploy error issue nomad hack case ,time 
369517,case way bridge handles tokens gnosis chain aka ex xdai either compound aave fork allowed entrancy attack smth like basically yes ,chain fork attack 
369518,i'm curious,

369540,ok watching u sneaky ,watching 
369541,protocol need make rumours token they'll get plenty free testing,protocol 
369542,feel wrong way get core users ,
369543,agree formal ui ux testing needed ,
369544,generally recommend multiple audit one ,
369545,thats kind idea thinknig well cool things like eth rank leaderboard contributors might better ideas make working rather make test earn,eth 
369546,also lobsterdao hello lol helped test gearbox tremendously cryptotesters rabbithole layer3 smth ,
369547,lobs cryptotesters ,
369548,also think working zapper zapier want users get detailed p l sure though might chat understand ,
369549,booster poolinfo help,
369550,specifically pool crerewards field,
369551,kind testing really need,
369552,think code4rena model interesting,
369553,yea best,
369554,closer decentralized testing way curated,
369555,also helpful communicative,
369556,huge fan code4rena model en ppl,
369557, performance art,
369559,question remains gives moonbeam power halt chain halting simply meant users anything watch money drained ,chain money 
369560,anyway let eternal auditing debate distract devops failures bugs like always nobody escape reason hear dozens stupid bugs faang introduces code much harder exploit focusing limiting damage much important imho,

369568,yeah think spec issue newbie mistake ask,
369569,erc4626 specification bug ,

369571, simple mistake dire consequences validation receiver account accurate allowing anyone withdraw anyone else funds ,
369572,guess make sure u validate invalid paths ur testing,
369573,ah specific spec usual people testing code i'm building oz implementation anyway ,
369574,kind weird act like anything erc4626 ,
369576,non tech implement ,non

370296,using sentry analytics logging errors seems unnecessarily intentionally adding new user logging api endpoint taken last night,api 
370297,sentry like many logging monitoring frameworks strong destructuring,
370298,either way excuse huge problems solved years ago web2 blatant web3 basic application security audits logging output clearly ignored,application 
370299,yes sentry grabs environment variables saves tell sentry send specific data one line code dont understand one would honest,data 
370300,adding new user analytics literally stealing private key web3 logging deserved wallet need collect kind analytics log much spend thought send crash report enough privacy reasons ,wallet 
370301,hanlon razor probably intern set logging,
370303,buy ,
370304,sentry's page,
370305,write sentry error report new user event accident even intern,event 
370306,saying justified bad practice log anything sensitive user especially something like sentry,
370307,poor form,
370308,could also backend crash visible user bug something could mistake tbh definetely ignorant user security since send sentry event containing mnemonic private key one would need store env variables dont really know wallets made assume need actually store mnemonic plain text exclude sending sentry offer option ,event key 
370309,buy one things farfetched world mistake well closed source help anyone else verifying ,source

370315,sentry less minefield unless emit private key seed errors usually log data provide,seed data 
370316,sentry self hosted though usually decentralization finest,self decentralization 
370317,problem hosted data collected,data

371016,poor taste quantstamp use intern meta digging deeper hole ,
371017,yes agree w everything,
371018,vasiliy summarizing sides,
371019, ,
371020,aaaand moving thanks fin ,
371023,hi someone explain get leverage using lending protocols ,
371025,either arb leverage means loan borrow recursively asset type like dai 5% deposit apy usdc 3% borrow apy deposit dai borrow usdc swap usdc dai deposit dai every step size becomes smaller overall aggregate position larger basically arbitraging endogenous supply rates within protocol done lot recently steth eth aave example arbing rates enter leveraged position putting eth borrowing dai buying eth dai putting dai back enter leveraged long usually inferior perp offerings days anyway indexcoop used token leveraged positions long time yet far dpi defi index kicked use gearbox eyes able getting yields exogenously aka use protocols leverage time ,type protocol eth eth eth time defi index time 
371026, sacrificing lobster shill,
371027,go long get coin supply aave compound borrow usd swap coin supply aave compound 5 6 times reach max 3x leverage less go short get usd supply aave compound borrow coin want short sell usd supply usd aave compound borrow coins sell supply etc use gearbox faster ivangbi tell,coin usd coin usd coin usd usd 
371029,thanks would work terms ethpow trade concept ,
371030,issue trade concept likely alpha easiest way go put stable btc compound aave etc borrow eth keep wait ethalik fork issue likely second fork people sell eth quite likely position would go would underwater asset hands even sell extra eth fork cause main chain still need return stable ,btc eth fork fork eth eth fork chain 
371031,likely try go asset tightly correlated eth eth drops collateral drops,eth eth 
371032,going stable risky going semi shitcoin major enough less risky maybe idk,
371033,please everyone correct whatever missed,
371034,sell eth short,eth 
371035,literally fking retarded ,
371036,would happen collat insta worth 0 fork chain get liquidated get keep forked eth anyway,fork chain eth 
371037,ye free trade unlikely get anything idk trading aspect kingdom aka pinned ,trading 
371038,actually good question immediate answer happens chainlink price feeds aave comp react know chainlink stop publishing fork chain protocols read last price forever ,stop fork chain 
371039,true mev bots definitely buy cheap unpegged usd supply clear protocol ethw,usd protocol 
371041,chainlink said support fork ,fork 
371042,believe protocol read last price forever unless protocol make shenanigans chainlink otherwise,protocol protocol 
371043,protocols stop reading heartbeat period passed pretty sure aave checks liveliness data e g btc eth mainnet 1h theoretically timeframe theoretically fallback oracles aave maintained v1 v2 per documentation v3 also seem fallbacks anymore pointed 0x0 roughly 3 months ago ,data e g btc eth mainnet 
371044,matter tho liquidity poloniex scamchanges justin approve deposits first dump shit done right ,liquidity 
371045,simply buy eth much simpler would still get eth fork essence would ethpow ethpos retarded btw ,eth fork 
371046,yes trivial ,
371047,1h plenty clear mev fuckery watch ,
371048,kinda depends last update pairs ,
371049,yeah borrow eth trick want zero price exposure meantime,eth 
371050,btc eth updated last 55 minutes ago merge happens theoretically 5 mins value accepted anymore ,btc eth 
371051,multiply money supply usdc borrow eth since eth pos keep 1x usdc 0 8 eth ethpow get 0 8 ethpow 0 8 0 2 less eth yeah big upside still,money usdc eth eth pos eth eth 
371052,still exposed liquidation prospect ,
371053,happens mev flashbots likely support miners left first first searchers ,
371054,likely ye cynical trade dump free money plebs,dump money 
371055,could yeah unlikely happen always return eth getting close liquidation,eth 
371056,old fashioned way gas wars guess,gas 
371057,u getting close tho,
371058,still confused mean zero price exposure ,
371059,eth pumps hard meanwhile lose money still eth protocol know,eth money eth protocol 
371060,basically eth care price need give back x eth x eth wallet times ,eth eth eth wallet 
371061,would relevat though ,
371062,mean merge pump shenanigans,
371063,sorry relevant still slow,
371065,guy asked happens get liquidated borrow eth sell protocol sees eth going price eating collateral reality since still eth always return lose money,eth protocol eth eth money 
371066,smol understand alfa buy hold eth get ethpow instead complicated borrowing operations pls explain simply retard,eth 
371067,returning eth defeats whole purpose ,eth 
371068,alfa smol brain talk ethpow brain shrink,
371069,bear afraid eth dumps merge wanna get free fork money anyway borrow thing eth without caring dumps,eth fork money eth 
371070,reopen position less eth usd collateral,usd 
371071,position hedge eth dumping post merge meanwhile getting free ethpow,eth 
371072,hedge kinda play,
371073, protocol sees eth going price eating collateral referring ,protocol eth 
371074,get liquidated,
371075,yeah hedge eth also use trick join shitcoin farms,eth 
371077,ethereum ,ethereum 
371078,everywhere time token farm also borrow,time 
371079,protocol know still eth wallet treats normal eth short,protocol wallet eth 
371080,referring merge play yeah eth side fork chain position prob get insta liquidated cause usdfork worth 0 lose hedge keep ethw,eth fork chain 
371081,yes u correct shvandrew ps ha yes yes,
371082,could explain clear,
371083,depends collateral might worth less,
371084,also functioning oracles,
371085,think thinking going long eth ie supply protocol supply stables borrow eth get liquidated dumps gucci,eth protocol eth 
371086,prob better stop else ivan gets angry price talk ,
371087,ye let continue make money kingdom enough ,money 
371089,anyone know reliable web3 project placing bets esports crypto ofc,
371090,creating one cryptonarratives,
371091,that's great looked stake 1xbit1,stake 
371092,still web1 2,
371093,think look like dex protocol anything,protocol 
371095,yeah completely agreed dex style,
371096,surprised prominent one already,one 
371097,launching back esports web3 moba game releasing,
371098,attempts they're either illegal regulated obscurity,
371099,interesting would love chat anyone thinking decentralized betting markets particularly within esports dm,
371100,happened augur polymarket etc ,
371101,funny 100x leverage pancakeswap there's binary options can't bet,
371102,lulz,
371103,sure augur always assumed crypto markets exciting gamblers hedgers interested crypto risk,crypto crypto 
371104,thus never took,
371105, ,
371106,augur better worse never popular enough relevant,
371107,usa users can't access pancakeswap finance ,finance 
371108,never thought,
371109,nope,
371110,cosmos ecosystem actually interoperable yet ,

371128,hilarious,
371134,shook randomly stumbled upon original video youtube earlier today seeing ct one confused guess simulation confirmed ,
371136, buy bags ,
371137,whole eth pow vs pos drama curious immutable stable like liquidity handle fork exist twice liquidity uses eth collateral theoretically could fork entire tvl exist twice guessing would massive liquidations chain real eth since price would probably dump,eth pow pos liquidity fork liquidity eth 
371138,dai seems even complex since multi collateral lot centralized worthless chain,chain 
371139,could interesting opportunity liquidity actually could become stable chain unwinds somewhat gracefully would default support day 1 assume,liquidity chain 
371140,updated numbers ,
371141,oh wait according crunchbase cool,
371142,likely lower would assume least 50% quoted sum correct ,
371143,liquity they're using chainlink tellor oracles chainlink says they're supporting ethereum forks tellor thing liquidations happen ,ethereum 
371144,yeah deployed lot capital h1 2022 think number something close 20b,
371145,great point even think oracle implications would happen liquidity pow neither oracle supports know contracts immutable assuming way add different one liquidity oracles break ,oracle liquidity pow oracle liquidity 
371146,interesting chain link usdc usdt 3 centralized entities effectively end making decision eth chain stay functional nuke hard due freezing oracles liquidity,chain usdt eth chain liquidity 
371147,uses last known good price,
371148,even change chainid best anyone would relay oracle update txes eth price fork think,oracle eth fork 
371149,well somewhat worrisome assuming care pow eth,pow eth 
371150,guess use h e justin sun's algostable,e 
371151,narrator nobody cares pow eth,pow eth 
371152,oh much care sense think absolutely fascinating case study happens usdc usdt suddenly cease work backed interesting see liquidity reacts fast price nukes good know ever large scale black swan event centralized stable,usdt work liquidity event 
371153,anything learned ,

371170,smth worry ,
371171,heard euler got exploited sure confirmed tho,
371172,oh that's bad ser got source ,source 
371173,deposited 1 5 weth collateral borrow 31 000 ctx withdrew weth collateral address funded tornado cash eth selling ctx also going straight tornado cash,address cash eth cash 
371174,original post etherscan link,etherscan 
371175,still looking looks like euler finance got exploited address ,finance address 
371177,31k ctx sold 47 eth,eth 
371178,isolated ctx holders,
371179,looks like oracle manipulation,oracle 
371180,yep isolated ctx lenders,
371181,yeah uni v3 lp oracle,oracle 
371182,oracle rating ranks 'high' risk manipulation shows would cost 10 move price 20%,oracle 
371187, ,
371188,euler gang got,
371189,fade bro michael life,
371190,afai remember ctx deposit playing gauge right ,
371191,wonder there's history,
371192,checked ,
371193,yeah thinking maybe lender trying play gauge got careless,
371194,possible considering going direction far evidence two impacted depositors seems ,
371195, ,
371196,yea nuking online presence ,
371197, ,
371198,mystery,
371200, ,
371205,cefi version rug pull ,
371206,tbf think best example euler working intended sad users aware risks associated pair low quality oracle ,oracle 
371207,rari ,
371209,fuse would impacted pool whole,
371210,impacted ctx,
371211,took loan ctx ctx worth 0 00000000001 never repaid,
371212,market checked univ3 twap correct pricing indeed 0 00000000001 ,market 
371213,lending markets like compound rari's fuse aave introduce bad collateral drain whole protocol that's token gated via governance euler anyone add isolated pair oracle easily manipulable get exploited losses contained within pair alone ,protocol governance oracle losses 
371214,every pool diffrent,
371215,aave v3 isolated pairs also afaik ,
371216,segregation isolation ofc spillage shorter,
371217,platform fault product offering make long tail usable,fault product offering 
371218,yeah also euler inform oracle risk much better terms ux,oracle 
371219, also adding long tail 100k usd volume make much sense dao take risk ,usd 
371220,neither fault speculating adoptioooon,
371221,pools like tetra's one attract lot capital,
371222,likely pool 150k,
371223,several lending pairs used euler one else currently supporting,
371224,yeah token gated governance right ,token governance 
371226,euler labs working something open lot possibilities like tetra's old pool developing new oracle yer think case showed euler working intended unfortunate oracle rating tools used actively one would hope ,oracle oracle 
371227,usual question even long tail ,
371228,add 1000x risk make 10 dollars revenue,
371229,cool tool tho sure arguing,
371230,idk feel makes sense markets rely economic activity rather biases towards permissionless vs governance gated ,permissionless governance 
371231,euler model works fuse work due governance gating less sophisticated players ,work governance 
371232,ctx guy posted euler discord,
371235,also euler working daos add pol univ3 harden uni oracles wonderland ,
371236,yes cool idea,
371237,point 'long tail' euler's target market design philosophy building secure permissionless systems protocols especially compound rely devs governance knowing markets safely activated study tokens properly bad things happen hence majority compound forks rekt reentrant tokens always found way confound devs charge thinking build protocol designed handle long tail exotic assets default need devs know ins outs charge listing assume tokens listed hostile weird 'balanceof' functions reentrancy fee transfer increases composability protocol security overall philosophy ,market permissionless governance tokens tokens protocol tokens protocol

371319,nah works least technically practice governments find way broke law guess try hard enough developing something allows badthings tm us considered free speech somehow often using badthings tm explicitly listed sdns hand illegal sure ,
371320,wait second someone technically make contract mixes like 001 eth tornado cash something send like 10k addresses based parameters like acc balance 100k usd basically fuck people purpose making go sanctions list lol,contract cash addresses usd 
371321,would pretty easy argue mass scale targeted transfer someone's address could deadly though,address 
371322,well v3 explicitly bad thing still bad thing pretend different people forking people trust gate especially given risk could favorite 3las launching honeypot,trust

371911,he's ceo fiatcoin spends time marketed better tether know better,time tether 
371912,tweet literally linked article says freeze funds part took issue clearly guy acted like arbitrarily ,
371913,people pointed contradiction correct,
371914,posted contradiction within tweet like thats link leads ,
371915,that's i'm saying,
371916,different hedera lying whitepaper,
371917,yes likely quick response part big maliicous attempt lie people need get people making mistakes sometimes ,
371918,actually worse least hedera walked back claims eventually,
371919,would give benefit doubt evidence mistake,doubt 
371920,definitely argue saying circle issuer usdc freeze usdc address time whatever reason without context creates degree fud ,usdc address time 
371921,people read see fud people trying sell fiatcoin something ,
371922,unambiguously true every sense word many people seek minimize realities using fiatcoin using flowery language hiding technical details bottom needlessly wordy lawyerspeak people read know unsurprisingly ceo said fiatcoin one,
371923, yes promise blah blah blah 1000 words later best interest blah blah blah ,
371924,many people seek minimize realities using algostables using flowery language hiding technical details bottom needlessly wordy lawyerspeak people read know ,
371925,would algostable need lawyerspeak ,
371926,certainly call algostables find though,
371927,sorry replaced lawyerspeak 'hype' complicated diagrams,
371928,disagreeing annoyed algostables misrepresenting agreed comment wrt,
371929,things necessarily complicated that's fault would much rather million algostables yet another fiatcoin pretend fiatcoin wrapper,fault 
371930, ,
371932,want make fiatcoin wrapper least lie like top 2 today,
371933,i'm arguing people traces stained eth irrelevant police equating guy personally giving instructions north korea evade sanctions,eth 
371934,i'm saying opsec good practices respecting law live least paper etc etc important things i'm saying like fear porn like 10 years ago bitcoin buy drugs hire hitmen bought bitcoin would go similar narratives use defi kyc can't protect interacting nk haxxorz ,fear bitcoin defi kyc 
371935, traces stained eth different choosing use tornado sanctioned,
371937,there's censorship like self censorship,self 
371938,seems like algostables still unsolved need least one 'legit' fiatcoin wrapper,
371939,maybe palestinian care,
371940,impact tornado cash sanctions stablecoins care decentralized stablecoins options anon ,cash 
371941,ymmv,
371942,good enough purposes whether they're irrelevant police that's problem worry,
371943,there's huge difference oh would neighbour think use bitcoin actual sanctions one ignore can't ,
371944,agree like people rugged thousands coins thousands people,
371945,make mistake technical difference today yesterday tornado 2x harder access much still possible feeling lucky means lol,
371946,mean actual narrative swallowed years police investigate buying bitcoin else would buy consequences reading whitepaper nothing else journalists ,bitcoin 
371947,trying leave impact many contract interact get rekt surprised,contract rekt 
371948,yeah code works devs free copypaste non sanctioned contracts even try launder sanctioned eth ,eth 
371949,saying simply things small scale unimportant get persecuted even noticed however mean get persecuted cross line unlucky ,
371950,narrative pushed without sort backing even law behind essentially media fluff equivalent would neighbour think actual weight behind specific set laws back enforce context ,
371951,yeah much agree,
371952,sure could use lot pushback increase unnecessary risks likelihood affected frozen assets legal issues etc significantly increased ,
371953,yeah 100% agree statement i'm also saying someone usa case accept coins mean everyone dance around necessarily maybe people wanting make statement contrary can't tell code etc etc ,
371954,neither pretending substitute financial system malfunctioning code work nobody develops current state things around crypto nowadays build global non kyc system can't stop may interact unbanked people better said known beginning would happen ,system work state non kyc system 
371955,hard american mind understand countries outside us real people living separate life separate set standards,
371956,i've read dozens projects wanting put stocks american stock market dex going avoid selling american stocks iranian none documents see dev developing thing unaware consequences sounds best good dev,market 
371957,addresses received 0 1 eth 10 days time inform law enforcement blocked virtual currency must reported ofac within 10 business days thereafter annual basis long virtual currency remains blocked ,addresses eth time currency currency 
371958, interact people sanctioned countries problems people sanctioned countries ,
371959,geez hard discuss uncertain regulations regulators,
371960,anything uncertain ofac i'd much rather 10 sec pdfs lol,
371964,gonna ban u r americans chill please spam,
371966,that's saying american entity expected comply american rules case whether user non american american point seem really matter go jail trying hide small transaction probably assets frozen associated particular wallet probably yes ,non transaction wallet 
371967,sry,
371968,protip buy lobs seek shelter lobsterdao kingdom ivan hurt ,
371971,hypothetically speaking would interesting know interacted sanctioned country unknowingly receive money intermediary say company company client said client gets investigated nk money mean something even part money used pay given nature wallets hard argue judge x z wallets middle stained eth last wallet end willingly helping sanctioned country ,money money money eth wallet 
371972,couch legal stops tornado inspired fake lawyers piss talked lusd rai dai sai mai fai kai lai last fake obviously talked consequences talked blacklisting talked forks tornado lulz aztec fork ofc etc end also talked truly decentralized concepts harder time scaling etc stop repeating stuff circles use ctrl f new stuff pops every retarded message non expert ban memes memes go kingdom aka buy shit nft u spam ,fork time stop non nft 
371973,go ahead try kind sers ,
371974,thoughts uniswap foundation vote ,
371975,uniswap company ,
371976,one benefits foundation foss projects pay people work project uniswap already along tons contributors can't really see benefit another entity,
371977,little confusing existence uniswap labs protocol ventures uniswap grants,protocol 
371978,read comments ,
371979,uniswap company,
371980,guys eth xmr atomic swaps solve issue reaction today already working btc atomic swap successful eth tesnet swaps ,eth xmr btc eth 
371981,atomic swaps fine needs way determine price swap since lping option ,
371982,kinda boring sit xmr smart contracts sight,xmr 
371983,swap fresh new wallet,wallet 
371984,rather easy track unless split funds also move funds multiple times increase anon set,
371985,tornado standardized amounts,
371986,aztec moment especailly defi added could see exchanges supporting zketh zkdai directly usa citizens tho ,defi 
371987,what's current anonymity set aztec ,
371988,tornado c 200k eth,eth 
371990, ,
371991,pretty good capping 5eth 10k dai ,
371992,thanks maybe deposit cap place able walk fine line longer nk hackers find much use cap ,
371993,hard swapping 100 eth xmr 2 3 swaps back fresh wallet seems like simple price pay anonymity,eth xmr wallet 
371994,could still use would take long time ,time 
371995,timing analysis attack wait awhile else people track output eth back eth deal xmr price volatility ,analysis attack eth eth xmr 
371996,liquidity ,liquidity 
371997,case tornado anyway minus volatility,
371998,last checked btc xmr liquidity still picked ,btc xmr liquidity

372006,time x anonset key,time key 
372007, timing market quite difficult lol,market 
372008,yea say hurdle currently way,
372009,swapping eth xmr ,eth xmr

372011,example happening irl ,

372014,problem effects every privacy protocol touches public sphere,protocol 
372015, would work 0 reward perhaps someone knows financial incentive publicise fact,reward 
372016,ah sorry misread comment ,
372017,show total regardless token deposited eth eth deposited ,token eth eth 
372018,think eth,eth 
372019,zcash offers opt privacy that's kinda broken,zcash 
372020,ah heres something calculates anon set ,
372021,yeah opt privacy always vulnerable spying crackdowns,
372023,buy rips sell dips ,
372024,atomic swaps chain still use services like sideshift etc ,chain 
372025,sideshift cex,
372026,half dex,
372027,tell tries find decentralized way swap coins cant asks kyc,kyc 
372028,sideshift ask kyc,ask kyc 
372029,hope jinx though ,
372030,mistake i'm thinking shapeshift,
372031,sideshift operates outside us jurisdiction already,us 
372032,sideshift gives back coins,
372033,yeah,
372034,matter even little bit americans use,bit 
372035, vpn tor i2p ,tor 
372036,sure,
372037,great swapping smaller amounts crosschain,
372038,here's playbook fbi agent emails informing american trying swap nothing swap rekt,rekt 
372039,every pirate darknet custodial mixer etc takedown follows process,
372040,broken even atomic swap transparent address shield fully shielded z z transaction whatever address need whatever amount want nobody earth would able trace problem zcash kinda homework able use properly,address transaction address zcash 
372041,broken way matter privacy hermetically sealed recipient messages open basketball hoop,
372042,ok see mean,
372043,lucky may fortunate enough recipient cares privacy much recipients enough people non private scheme kinda useless like covering black cloth middle lit room thinking one sees things like fb friends get information even though never gave directly family clicks yes permissions like robots know better companies gladly hose available data,scheme data 
372044,know one team,
372045, shilling ze bag banteg thx example treasury transparency,transparency 
372046,yis,
372047,well worst happen leak funds received yet information disclose bank account everyone nobody still able see funds financial privacy ,
372048,shielded txs default,
372049,iirc,
372050,want privacy use cash share private keys kek,cash 
372051,cant track transactions never moves,transactions 
372052,slowly moving cashless society wont always option,
372053,enough people way guy middle lit room running around black cloth head screaming i'm invisible ,
372054,yeah well nobody cares privacy f default try lil optimistic,
372055,offers sort privacy suppose reason advise try drink cup water fishing net i'd advise want consider alternatives first,
372056,haram,
372057,true that's better,
372064,believe case removed trusted setup tho also cool,
372065,think zcash tries play nice get tornado ed,zcash 
372066,zook definitely pro reg,
372067,go read twitter,twitter 
372068,think bad thing done right,
372069,done right huge though,
372070,yeah seems like public default consequences clear transaction works like bitcoin sender receiver transaction value publicly visible many wallets exchanges exclusively use addresseses today many moving shielded addresses better protect user privacy ,transaction transaction addresses 
372071,dont get,
372072,that's definitely black cloth lit room privacy,
372073,standard satisfy ok ivan,
372075, coine r sambacha u smart excuse 1 word per message related sam tbh,
372076,guess one uses shielded options kinda pointless,
372077,still waiting see zcash cook privacy narrative evolve looking good tbh,zcash 
372078,crypto exchange nuri previously called bitwala files insolvency germany link,crypto exchange 
372079,moonwell launches governance forum gauntlet publishes review moonwell post nomad ,governance 
372080,yeah unless dreaded criminals stake entire eth lido dump received tokens curve hyperbole maybe hopefully,stake eth dump tokens 
372081,oh nice used bitwala client back 2017 excited new release quickly stopped since fuckin impossible kyc seen life,kyc 
372083,xmr zcash privacy default optional privacy,xmr zcash

372090,tbf due solaris bank charge ,
372091,bitwala nuri shinier frontend ,
372092,offered celcius staking app maybe that's reason ,
372093,oooooooof,
372094,eur funds safu solaris they're saying ,
372095,well long need crypto ramps going problem see way around,crypto 
372096,thanks know one name touch wasted much time bullshit,time 
372097,even minimizing amount data collected helps lower spying potential said ramps,data 
372098,buying xmr fiat tells exchange much xmr buying eth tells exchange everything eth,xmr fiat xmr eth eth

372103,link tornado though,
372104,right something right,
372105,lobster daily 497 daily recap 8 august 1 liquity handle eth pow pos drama link discussion 2 best address visualization tool link discussion 3 specially designated nationals list update tornado cash added read link discussion 4 bad collateral root cause recent collapses like terra algorithmic stablecoins link link discussion 5 sideline capital 23 billion count size link link discussion,eth pow pos address cash

372113,uniswap curve tornado ,
372114,sounds like good exit strategy circle,exit 
372116,sam's take pretty na ,
372117,think missed point,
372118,mean else say ,
372119,oh get point far almost every crypto statement labelled unlikely happened ,crypto 
372120,also point point easy blacklisting 1 address frax controls unlikely happen yes structural holding usdc different maker's example entirely psm contract ,address contract 
372121,get point since addresses formally owned entities like bank accounts really matter ofacs point view frax sanctioned usdc may compelled blacklist wide scope narrow one uncharted territory knew day would come high time prepare next one ,addresses usdc time 
372122,literally said op tweet verbatim i'm sure point ,
372123,yeah blacklist address depositing pools ,address 
372124,tornado gitcoin grants blacklisted technically address operated external service ,address 
372125,read original tweet that's literally said ,
372126,sloppy ends sam post good context,
372127,wtf,
372130,since ,
372131,blacklist uniswap pool blacklist depositing address usdc stay forever said blacklist others well correct ,address usdc 
372132,blacklist permanent,
372133,interesting permit router like uniswap may end blacklisting,router 
372134,that's true talking blacklist function go look code actual function takes single address argument ,function function address 
372135,maybe still validating,
372136,digital gulags,
372137,well exactly ofac blacklist anything true affect onchain usdc hand saying unlikely usdc blocks public pools bit stretch since beyond control we're kansas anymore sadly ,bit 
372138, ,
372139,hence depositing address blacklisted lp withdrawal transfer fail ,address 
372140,agreed actually agree ,
372141,yup,
372142,unban,
372143,simply send lp token another address wdym,address 
372144,advice,
372145,potentially one attack vault,attack 
372146,sure that's problem there's timelock dao upgrade policy withdraw new address way actually get usdc frozen either hit permanently contract frax dao time blacklisting effective ,dao address contract dao time 
372147,ya exactly,
372148,yeah work permit automation tracking ,work 
372149,hand typed addresses etherscan bet yet,addresses 
372152,least understanding,
372153,matter time innit,time 
372154,code method remove addresses blacklist principle ,addresses 
372156,new pinned message year ffs ,year 
372157,clear rhethorical question answer ,

372194,daily hacks getting tiresome ngl,
372195,beginning security web3 meme,
372196,agree get better stronger ,
372197,anyone know anything new web3 gaming company limitbreak gabe leydon machine zone founder always fan gabe leydon thinking games years saw they'd raised stealth curious anyone happens know probably reach,machine 
372198,always issues web2 web3 lot vulnerabilities js dns issues time ,time 
372199,recession started year numbers going skyrocket,year 
372200,apply lusd governance freeze someone minting lusd long eth collateral counterparty value eth,governance eth eth 
372201,also true lusd uses chainlink oracles chainlink oracles proxy patterned upgradeable chainlink signers ,
372202,true chainlink oracles pretty much break defi anyway change oracle provider necessary future ,defi oracle 
372203, ,
372204,well i'm correcting take indeed require trust chainlink signers oracle lusd uses ,trust oracle 
372205,that's ppl say careful chainlink fwiw,
372206,using tellor backup contracts immutable also seen first smart contract ban say lusd oracle supplying data getting flagged future ,contract oracle data 
372207,well yes said excluding chainlink frax lusd seem like would take immense lockdown blockchain shut however,blockchain 
372208,tellor alone reliable source liquity would dry scenario,source 
372209,yeah fully aware saying living cause chainlink allows another centralized entity forced act certain way tho ,
372210,kinda think rai lusd ,
372211,left oracle vector open switch case fuckery,oracle 
372213,lusd rekt ,rekt 
372215,doesnt rai use chainlink well ,
372216,although need proceed caution curve exchange seems unaffected uses different dns provider,exchange 
372217,pretty scary wondered chainlink couple years,
372218,yeah point elsewhere ,
372219,lusd since immutable ,
372220,lusd exclusively dependent chainlink,
372221,stated using tellor backup ,
372222,fails tellor kicks fails well dies,
372223,better pretend game maker frax,
372224,meh shit really really matter circle forced blacklist chainlink forced upgrade sanction everybody using tellor smart contract right pretty much shown willing either things last couple days ,contract 
372225,kinda win legal battle able literally blacklist entire smart contracts ,
372227,could cause tellor fail ,
372228,really one group sells fiatcoin wrapper something pretty straightforward dependencies,
372229,shame hindsight use onchain oracle v3 exactly exist time ,oracle time 
372230,chainlink blacklists lusd due sanctions even worse contracts immutable changeable lqty holders governance kind governance would easy switch twap oracle permabricks lusd ,governance governance oracle 
372231,viable solution kinda moment depend people price data kinda gg even uniswap pair use peg use eth usdt eth usdc ,data eth usdt eth usdc 
372232,thing governance could point considering governance could sanctioned brick dubious,governance governance 
372233,gonna using tellor indefinitely gonna get exponentially risky people gonna look exit prolly ,exit 
372234,governance also attack vector ,governance 
372236,course getting pricing data rise level sanction,data 
372237,i'm worried total immutability lusd contracts chainlink stops serving lusd right possible lusd holders lqty holders greater community anything basically ,immutability 
372238,mean could argued nah essence enabling creation decentralised stable talking lusd attacked kinda means reason right prevents circle forced blacklist uniswap pools deliver price reference data allows illegal decentralised stablecoins build ,data 
372239,issue found reverted approved contracts curve past hours please revoke immediately please use curve exchange propagation curve fi reverts normal contract needs revoked 0x9eb5f8e83359bb5013f3d8eee60bdce5654e8881 approved please revoke immediately ,exchange contract 
372240,delivery merely coincidental though anything circle asked blacklist uniswap facilitates illegal currency exchange far likely,currency exchange 
372241,point people maybe consider pegging something usd fiatcoin experiments,usd 
372242,mean dealing people thought entire tc ban point surprised shit like happening ,
372243,freeze sanction circle blacklist using lusd rai legal perspective ,
372244,think major issue trying peg anything first place either deal centralized entities issuing wrap shit 10 times centralized oracles making possible governance able attack peg sound promising tbh compromises top compromises ,governance attack 
372245,yeah that's great upgradable gov ,
372246,nope none entirely immutable decentralized lqty gov rights ,
372247,chainlink decides upgrade contracts lusd can't use nothing done ,
372248,mean theoretically continue running long tellor reports prices none oracles report anymore use last known price forever ,
372249,could argued chainlink blacklists kinda ,
372250,seems like protocols aiming core primitives need upgradable entirely self contained ,self 
372251,guess instant fair like said code continues report last price reported oracles hopefully give enough time lusd holders sell everything late i'd assume peg would even volatile currently right that's kind great outcome either ,time 
372252,that's view well ,
372253,someone working oracles think actually building something oracles able adjust potential changes world trouble much change go wrong blind trust oracle project kinda insane ,trust oracle 
372254,totally i've always confused lusd holders bragging literally nothing code ever changeable forever immutable ,
372255,would make sense something like uniswap amm basically tool needs non changing structure make sense anything trying stable value ,
372256,can't create new contracts get ppl convert long way around usually works get ppl close positions time migrate mean someone deployed intial contracts right someone could deploy new ones ,time 
372257,immutability meme window tho ,immutability 
372258,work integrated lusd protocol every single thing stack would also need change,protocol 
372259,yep precisely would ,
372260,changed thing better change course hit iceberg see coming,
372261,change governance instead that's point governable stablecoin like uniswap base layer consensus contracts anything ,governance stablecoin consensus 
372262,redeploy upgradable oracles redeploy immutable contracts nr2 would use gonna migrate new version everytime face oracle troubles ,oracle 
372263,requires goverance that's way someone release contracts update front end,
372264,oracles issue plagues solidity chainlink center point failure code oracle source ever screwed go pull basket oracle feeds self twap value,solidity oracle source oracle self 
372265,think important thing understand tradeoffs people saying lusd impervious things dai frax weak quite right dai frax impervious lot things simple fixes us would rek lusd force redeploy everything basically dead ,force 
372266,mim,
372267, ,
372268,kind moot lusd liquidity multiples dai frax go large scale solution ham stringed immutability plus mind crypto anything ever changing,liquidity immutability 
372273,depends unlike chainlink tellor permissioned,
372274,agreed 100% protocol certain strengths value propositions though none perfect ,protocol 
372276,long someone willing report price continue work,work 
372277, report price accurately often tellor either least past,
372278,thinking proposing attack proposing lusd would completely unnecessary pretendao would simply need go said pretendao,attack 
372279,reason need jump hoop going chainlink impervious direct attack frax makerdao vulnerable also pretendao risk,attack 
372280,wtf pretendao like derogatory way saying fake dao ,dao 
372281,practice,
372282,k cool still change fact lusd fake dao would entirely rekt chainlink updated contracts remove great point guess ,dao 
372283,pretendao would need go chainlink,
372284,simply ask dao brick end jail wanna see many people willing risk freedom online voting game ,dao 
372285,admittedly problem past last time checked reduced possible time updates accuracy well dependent amount people updates watching network,time time 
372286,can't put dao jail mean actual msig signers something oracle setting onchain tokenholder vote like governorbravo type contract since critical stablecoin system like lusd makerdao's oracles actually well done terms need updated ,dao oracle type contract stablecoin system 
372287,can't put smart contract jail either useful stops tokenholders voting dead address new oracle ,contract address oracle 
372288,last 60 days polygon single address fulfilled requests also let kid moment chainlink would blacklist everybody would stop using lusd ,address 
372289,understand saying thing i'm pointing lusd immutable can't even change oracle way hardfork new token address system contract bad everyone must already implicitely trust chainlink oracle keep serving liquity holding lusd ,oracle address system contract oracle 
372290,claiming governance would solve hypothetical problem governance propose failure state,governance governance state 
372291,sure idea absence pretendao liquity solves anything farce,
372292,ya i'm saying ,
372293,yep that's basically i'm saying effect lusd like pretendao like call pretendao chainlink rather something else ,
372294,never pretended hammering stablecoin practically via proxy full control chainlink also semi nice ,stablecoin 
372295, ,
372296,sure talking literally go app frax finance daistats com get real time transparent view much frax dai fiat wrapped took 20 minutes arguing admit lusd chainlink pretendao call even guess ,finance time fiat 
372297,claim decentralized stablecoins,
372298,best fiatcoin wrappers,
372299,lusd chainlink pretendao ,
372300, fin,
372301,eth collateralized stablecoin uses chainlink's oracles non exclusively different fiatcoin wrappers actual pretendaos also dependent oracles,eth stablecoin 
372302,bru,
372303,open dependencies somehow never shows tweets info put together infuennzzaaa stuff retweet ,
372306,find buried le docs tho,
372307,unstoppable long chainlink allows ,
372309,right even worse can't even change chainlink pretendao pretendao process ,
372310,entirety argument muddy waters claiming we're since use chainlink's oracles we're better way get blacklisted chainlink pretendao something reality possible 'fix' 'problem' liquity chainlink dependency completely irrelevant simply go straight dao point moot best,dao 
372311,disingenuity par course,
372312,cool guess different flavors pretendao's different people suppose remind lusd fans least brand pretendao like us omit fiatcoin wrapper part sure ,
372313,would branded lqty governance token good attempt,governance 
372314,right link governance token cl msig signers ,governance token 
372315,make fiatcoin wrapper dependent 2 daos ,
372316,might want consider giving link holders tangible governance powers votes,governance 
372317,governance add,governance 
372318,might well also let usdc holders vote right ,
372319,read recovering double oracle failure extreme unlikely event oracles fail liquity uses last good price seen operations effectively freezing price used system however liquity still best recover switch back primary oracle comes back online ,oracle event system oracle 
372320,one idea 3rd party dependency constitutes dao,
372321,throw eth,eth 
372322,seen presentation given live oracle summit berlin exact questions asked answer change anything beyond rekt oracles fail change active choice made still running around twitter pretending decentralised dai retweeting shit people pretend full mercy 4 9 multisig way ever potentially overcome hurdle ,oracle rekt twitter 
372323,decentralized dai objectively true,
372324,kek honestly anything using glorified multisig calling decentralised farce kinda goes defi ,defi 
372325,least maker votes people deploying unit makes oracles possible ,
372326,keep writing like they're exclusively dependent chainlink ,
372327,know project goes 0 dependancy gone ,
372328,pretending they're exclusively dependent chainlink ,
372329,bit farce justify immutable contracts simply deploying immutable contract centralized oracle project goes nature decentralised stablecoin slap tellor lulz decentralisation part even though never used entire tvl omega nuke chainlink ever stops serving stop pretend game pls ,bit contract oracle stop 
372330,sure think doubling lie answer question,
372331,would say biggest risk decentralized stables may oracles create purely chain dataset 1 eth stable eth wbtc swap values allow us derive value 1 rough draft system could work could cut price feeds chain sources create immutable chain unit accounting data sets always derive values ,eth eth system chain chain data 
372332,glib slap tellor supposed serious grasping straws make point ,
372333,whether would actually go 0 torn still well 0,
372334,frank think real challenge decentralized stablecoins appear actual way scale without taking real world custody aka fiatcoin risk mentioned yesterday let forward wrote ,custody 
372335,many reasons volatility eth need know every stablecoin built overcollateralized asset model fraction fraction either dai frax's mcap coincidence take real world data heart clearly illustrating point lusd fei susd rai combined even reach 800m market cap although love individual unique innovations something learn teams world class incredibly small we're trying build stablecoin ants simply going grow past certain size using models crypto evidence single overcollateralized stablecoin grows size rather shrinks time ,eth stablecoin data market stablecoin time 
372336,years ago dexs never gonna make either,
372337,literally reiterating bit drama liquity presented oracle summit better aligns values decentralised backstop fully aware entire construct relies centralized entity setup even switched backup continuously try default chainlink available preferred choice fully hands cl instead using project better aligned values obviously gonna meme still go centralized one reasons pretty damn obvious moment cl gone liquity gonna everything power fork farce ,bit oracle fork 
372338,something happened yet mean,
372339,question whether scale happened far scale till,
372340,regurgitated point 3 times,
372341,think doubling lie answer question ,
372342,true far evidence points overcollateralized model going might unique innovation new stability mechanism fully decentralized scale billions onchain entirely far evidence show yet appear overcollat model ,mechanism 
372343,well definitely scaling exact mechanism nonstop shrunk time there's probably yet invented mechanism possibly ,mechanism time mechanism 
372344,based gigachad ,
372346,scaling ,
372347,stop taking guy's bait lmao,
372348,well clearly lusd users since there's 180m mcap demand total ,
372349,even collateralized stables become niche oracle problem still seems much larger realized,oracle 
372350,clearly lol,
372352, ,
372353,thoughts folks would love hear alternative opinions,
372354,overall feel like contract approvals used necessary evil proper ux days thought put example eip would allow data token transfers ,contract eip data 
372355,also think something missing technical benefits,
372356, ,
372357,hahaha,
372358,felt stablecoin debate one sided comment liquity favor non upgradable contracts became lengthy shared couple tweets ,
372359,govt access chainanalysis pretty silly would take less time filter noise took create,time 
372360,reality quite simple pointing things bad people vested interest distracting everyone muddying waters claiming strategy left,
372361,quite similar grifter argument ago dare say virtually identical alas would expect nothing less principal parties involved selling things,
372362,might want check word grifter means dictionary means small scale swindling seeing lusd barely 12% 2% size frax dai respectively one side looks like grifter might want default calling everything else scam next everyone least knows true colors ,
372363,lol might want read post replying think i'm calling grifter,

372365,mean definitely label i'd use one simply referencing argument week ago,
372366,quote tweet defending chainlink reliance immutability part earlier pretendao fiatcoin wrapper conversation case actually nothing lusd anything like lot like people pointing fair critiques frax dai ignoring fair ones smaller stablecoins that's ,immutability 
372367, think well carry feel free search grifter interested lusd vs fiatcoin wrappers yes like either wrappers try sell something they're tangible benefit fiatcoin wrapping one manner liquity without pretendao games,
372368,ignoring issues associated smaller stables know they're small difficult scale they're issues project ending risks though challenge usdc wrappers yes scale costs decentralization censorship resistance think asking questions good especially given threat centralization trust people placed assets ,decentralization trust 
372369,like fiatcoins changing anytime soon that's selling point dai frax weth esque immutable contract lot ought doable,contract 
372370,agree ,

373093,lol guess anything outside nfts got little clue lol,
373094,cool exactly looks like legit token terminal revenue feel like author gem uniswap revenue still 0 ,
373095, ,
373096,kid got soon back muh hacked selling,
373097, ,
373098,nightmare fuel,
373099,ur seed phrase stays point ,seed phrase 
373100,u go propagate tx somehow else ,
373102,point one consensys nuking ability use infura interact tcash contracts despite ability use another service,
373103,long seed always find way around import ledger seed metamask ,seed ledger seed 
373104,ye also get emilianobonassi,
373105,existence alternatives completely immaterial point compliance,
373106,well let's see metamask owned consensys consensys owns mycrypto know consensys they're company owns infura,
373107,yes also change rpc url within metamask,
373108,change rpc right,
373109,hope need explain problem move another option coinbase wallet perhaps probably read first name think another wallet maybe trust wallet good news binance owns trust wallet,wallet wallet wallet trust wallet 
373110,rabby ,
373111,owned debank think,
373112,ya think debank fancies fight bottom line worry ,
373113,saying metamask eventually able remove custom rpc feature ,
373114,right,
373115,initate transactions geth directly help hardware wallet though ,transactions wallet 
373116,mean ,
373117,metamask proprietary software consensys whatever want,
373118,technically u create wallet,wallet 
373119,metamask like front ui ux,
373120,time launch coding bootcamp lol,time 
373121,talking rpc banning certain interactions chain like infura tornado changing another rpc still allows transactions ,chain transactions 
373122,learn code,
373123,run node ,node 
373124,soon cli wallets would option,
373125,understand can't rewrite another contract ,contract 
373126,would possible validators reject certain transactions would whole different problem lol,transactions 
373127,many validators ,
373128,course hope many would prevent though,
373129,thought metamask open source ,source 
373130,treasury saying illegal validate tx containing xxx would great start lol,
373131,fun prospects future poseth coinbase kraken lido super majority stake ,stake 
373132,im pretty sure backend validators available already used faster network transactions specifically nfts,transactions 
373133, ,
373134,good read thanks ,
373135,gonna dumb question service would prevent interacting non known contract address say prevent curve dns hack would apply rpc wallet level,contract address wallet 
373136, antoniomjuliano week important technology sanctioned today developer open source software arrested contents software line need take stand illegal attack freedom ,technology developer source attack 
373137,wrong though see proposing anything ,
373138,really besides need publicly take stand today leaders entire crypto community say far ,crypto 
373139,kinda toothless considering he's already complying,
373140,well who's itching insert martyr reference 2 0 ,
373141,isnt dydx banning tornado also ,
373142,well tornado guys already involuntary martyrs support way possible,
373143,part process find way legally work devs afraid go jail ,
373144,hope holding breath given space renowned ability move,
373145, ,
373146,like need storm streets something wealthy benefactors enough cover ensuing legal battle,
373147, ,
373148,rest us push decentralizing everything meantime,
373149,incentive many people think affected dirty tornado cash ,cash 
373150,way anything changes there's existential threat ethereum result else going old news time merge rolls around maybe get updates insert publication month poor devs couple chats,ethereum time 
373151,guarantee devs remember anyway tornado ofc special snowflake every defi protocol literally cannot used money laundering sets poor precedent inevitable attempts generalized crackdown later,defi protocol money laundering 
373152,oh i'm sure devs care somebody make care late lol certainly care better care ,
373153,message simple compliance rewarded defiance tolerated time defi dead long live comfi hyperbole maybe hopefully,time defi 
373154, ,
373155,would customer service actually give info,customer 
373156,matter incentive alignment killer thing end cartelizing space try criminalize prohibition fantastic example normally alcohol manufacturing fairly dull business outlaw suddenly every still protected dozen men automatic weapons,

373161,quick question outrage happened happening constantly years like sort new idea feds arrest creators mixers,
373162,privacy problem government getting wrong,government 
373163,provide,
373165,never tried arrest e g wasabi devs introducing coinjoin wallet,e g wallet 
373166,i'm saying exactly unpredictable unprecedented outcome,
373167,yeah there's precedence difference businesses operated people indifferent smart contracts,
373168, metacoin right one banning arresting creators mixer still different arresting founder a16z backed startup one step banning actual operators mixers reason say there's suddenly open season defi devs,one defi 
373169,that's good means there's time fight one nip hamfisted approach bud,time 
373171,flaw analogy target market quite content comfi dare say vast majority market care less tornado event haz nuffin hide ,market market event 
373173,comfi feel comfy lobs case feeling compliancy going next narrative especially supported institutional types enter picture ,
373177,disagree europe totally fine books banned enough people involved counter culture reformation ended thing matter critical mass ultimately appeal masses we're still early days pressure exert us likely increase significantly time,time 
373178,narrative banks bad one seeped aggressively western culture past decade two painting defi fulcrum populist coalition anti establishment right left wingers hard sell ,defi anti 
373179,heh sort thinking even critical mass within crypto existed continually eroded every compliant vc funded startup,crypto 
373180, ,
373181,i'm sure comparing conditions europe days anywhere near thing i'd go far saying europe access books substantially problems worry time banks bad without good reason many people burned pretty hard previous recessions caused huge panic people forgotten bail outs banks got mistakes though something said messaging pushed started becoming concerning crypto xyz feel good thing believe message sent things like right privacy hand waived away messaging ,time crypto 
373182,keeps losing got fucked btc tesla everything thought ,btc 
373183,yes first use printing press print indulgences short time horizon culture around technology ultimately matter technological space fundamentally corrosive sorts power structures people currently seeking translate cefi ,time technology 
373184,say done done done funamentally undermines compliance relationships past three hundred years,
373185,talking gutenberg printing press first use printing bible ,
373186, seems possible gutenberg printed indulgences early 1452 request nicolaus cusanus prominent german cardinal early connection printing bureaucratic needs church yes first use bible second working establishment times ,

373219,lets leave,
373220,ok contrarian twitter,twitter 
373223,hell ofac geth joke ,
373224,flashbots pr disallow transactions fr ofac list ,transactions 
373225,considering 80% nodes running mev geth close enough ofac geth,
373226,year ago would joke nottheonion,year 
373227,oh wait think relayer pr ,
373228,geth ,
373229,like geth developers ef payroll residing west ,developers 
373230,besides bots actually crypto chats bera guess,
373231, ,
373233,way idk related march may research free lobster dao chat user spotted relayers abusing another ones anti viruses make people chose another relayer idk information made thread ,dao 
373234,twitter space shared ,twitter 
373235,would one moderated genuinely wondering,
373236,altenative space developers tornado cash work technical ascept blocking ,developers cash work 
373237,1 guys bit experience w privacy working 2 speakers outlined seem directly privacy related unless r good privacy hid gg disrepsect tried filter based available info would die countless spaces altho urs cool blz proceed keep ,

373244,yeah next message typed one another seems like eventually message came new one ,one 
373245,also always remove code guy hell dont even run flashbots mev geth use different build entirely flashbots removed features retroactively eth callbundle example ,
373248,well ofcourse network going thru relayer guess different discussion relayer like makes system inherently centralized ,system 
373249,best dov projects better mechanism better vaults performance ,mechanism 
373250,way map token across place borrow ,
373251,thank clarifying ivan try bring experts people passionate field every week walk us specific topics crypto one time macro economist tons experience fun ,time

373258,comfi ftw,
373259,dai basically 15% crypto collateralized stable ,crypto 
373260,assume etherscan soon start sending data direct contract calls point defi nfts become difficult average bayc bullish ,etherscan data contract defi 
373261,transaction sent whatever rpc connected wallet nothing etherscan,transaction wallet 
373262,could still block people viewing website tho,
373263,yeah mean block transactions make common front ends unusable general public,block transactions public 
373264,quite actually newcomers guni tokens liquidity pools connected usdc common liquidity pairs circle co quite lot power render dai useless instant counterintuitively let's say 10k usdc wallet probability particular wallet millions wallets frozen might perceived lesser probability freezing single collateral makerdao that's merely current state dai design limit change theory ,tokens liquidity liquidity usdc wallet wallet state 
373265,yeah see people start forking official uis strip blacklist open users like dydx,
373266,aave ,
373267,still path huge cleansing imo almost like torrents popularity never really became mainstream blocked average joes bother looking mirrors anyway really debating cause probably boring,
373268,woah really hitting hard time night long pull requests innit,time 
373269,probably taken hint introduced kyc cozying institutions onwards ,kyc 
373270,yes,
373271,using trm labs,
373272,curious activities ,
373273,probably touched tornado,
373274,wonder vote went ,
373275,know purse justin sun,
373276,trm various risk profiles probably aave tweak bit set max risk blanket catch people 1 2 hops tornado seems like dydx ,bit 
373277,saying everyone touched tornado currently blacklisted virtually major defi seems like stretch,defi 
373278,going,
373279,even addies hops away banned dydx,
373280,aave interesting webapp hosted ipfs decentralized think they'd concerned trm's list,ipfs 
373281,dydx adjusted risk profile fixed ,
373282,already chainalsis rating high risk,
373283,yeah said mistake basically,
373284,tornado ipfs,ipfs 
373285,anyway gotta tornado check ig,
373286,using centralized risk assesment service,
373287, ,
373288,tornado also specifically sanctioned addresses touched tornado pre action,addresses 
373289,different risk profiles,
373290,get token away governance,governance 
373291,theory practice compliance rewarded ready comply ,
373292,know understand trm wondering protocols actually already enforcing said,
373293,i'm pretty certain giving personally identifiable information 3rd parties opposite solution problem let rephrase government scheme best trojan horse could ask even desirable big red button power fiatcoins provide ,government scheme 
373294,seems got many different ones starting week ,
373295,aave proof github ,proof 
373296,yeah gotta see works practice ie anyones addresses actually blacklisted merely using tc,addresses 
373297,trm token ought breaking aths lol,
373298,matter really,
373299,flip buitton change risk assesment ban every lobster holder,

373304,things i've learned space rich communities actually,
373305,that's true think best community life changing,
373306,especially consistently active ones,

373313,remember people shilling better decentralized alternative infura ,
373314,ooof,
373315,think need support sort canceldao keep remembering cases false promises spread awareness web3 project limitations like one betray decentralization movement say ,decentralization 
373316,nice,
373317,understood advantage pokt infura ability work decentralized e vitalik phial galadriel ,work e 
373318, stay compliance pocket portal blocking interaction number addresses connection pni pocket portal means activity involving portal absolutely required compliance us regulations lie investors ,us 
373319,bad idea kills,
373320,need ger rid centralized portal otherwise makes sense ,
373321,mind graph protocol exact centralized payment portal decentralized subgraph network,protocol 
373322,claim still rnd v1 portal,
373323, ,
373324,sec wishes effective lol,
373325,metamask implement kyc verification unfortunately predictable 1year ago uniswap banned derivatives tokens,kyc derivatives tokens 
373326,wen oracles banned facilitate creation illegal derivatives platforms ,derivatives 
373327,uniswap v3 ban built twap oracle ,oracle 
373328,meh already chain thinking us api3 chainlink band others ,
373329,mean everything f ked need light dark places lights go uni v3 twap better nothing really uniswap still break somehow chainlink controlled multisig afaik,
373330,mean randomly declared usage contract illegal yeah chainlink potentially forced multisig going path oracle would safe always ban usage oracle smart contract kek kinda important gets fought see random bans smart contracts facilitate illegal stuff,contract oracle oracle contract 
373331,uniswap invulnerable,
373332,unfortunarely work way use smart contract tell blockchain either censorship resistant entities people censor usage blochcain primitives dexes oracles infra like rpc ipfs gateways etc,work contract ipfs gateways 
373333,mean theory chainlink simply made blacklist contracts something like tellor gets complicated anybody report prices permissionlessly enough tokens staked tbh simple ban would addresses e g supply price data derivatives exchanges get flagged probably effect tc ban people stop answering specific price requests looks bleak tbh ,tokens e g data derivatives 
373334,btw um what's excuse going willingly compliant going asked go step comfi embrace add aml kyc can't pull can't card unless uniswap,aml kyc 
373335,wish makerdao would open oracles would cost zero whole ecosystem would benefit like dog manger situation ,
373336,solves nothing tho,
373337,controller dao dig details osm details since possible use ,dao 
373338,many ways shut oracles tbh scary part save truly would uniswap ,
373339,could elaborate way one shutdown makerdao oracle ,oracle 
373340,also seems company something oracles ,
373341,also fucked ,
373342,anything natively chain would fucked ,chain 
373343,ban usage contracts la tc go data sources supply data force revoke access target individual dao members run oracle unit pretty public proposal ,data data force dao oracle proposal 
373344,thanks honesty,
373345,1 data source never problem data providers find new one 2 target dao members understand matter settelment leyer network consensus smartcontract dao consensus cases mitigated using tor tornada,data source data dao consensus consensus tor 
373346,2 mean ,
373347, target individual dao members run oracle unit pretty public proposal imagine price oracles works dao members commit price result calcs stake consensus focal point reward etc concern bad actors come dao members commit prices compromise enough render oracle useless argue internet access via tor wallet owenership funding via tornado mitigate issue year ago thought page 9 wp long deprecated use still true today ,dao oracle proposal stake consensus reward dao oracle tor wallet year 
373348,although seems far simplier solution chainlink move multisig proper onchain dao ,dao 
373349,well one dao members rune christensen handful american vcs a16z quite favorite think people entities itching use tornado sanction ,dao 
373350,dao decides differently let think talking case community clearly want cencored external forces use limitation technology centralizations make ,technology 
373351,community want whatever wants reality built effectively backdoor system reality takes precedence desires every project tripping moment phone trm labs contract dao updates still happening,system contract dao 
373352,stated ,
373353, reading lines expect metamask start actively flag addresses better worse bit worried consider fighting phishing first thing help privacy cypherpunkey,addresses bit 
373354,unfortunately well implement kyc aml law every interaction users identification needed dont think defi exception regards ,kyc aml defi 
373355,use sourceify,
373356,like etherscan except contracts stores ipfs maintained ef,etherscan ipfs 
373357,use layerzero generalized abstract messaging cross chain token needed,chain token 
373358,post merge possible penalize validators skip ofac sanctioned blocks ,
373359, ,

373364,huh ,

373483,wonder could built browser wallets could verify checksum frontend exact mirror app aave com,
373484,think suggestion something enough consequences market forget 2 weeks absurdity sanction plain even regulators see stands i'd say sanction even successful probably anticipated dapps used defy sec tripping comply excuse going give they're asked implement aml kyc need pretend can't uniswap pull pretty much every dapp updatable already dubious plausible deniability hurr durr dao can't anything almost certainly dead point like said devs willing go jail million sorry 's make realities jail time easier lol sooo dev community something ,market aml kyc dapp time 
373485,dont need dev builder,
373486,could chain blacklist upgradable sc tho ,
373487,thread scroll,
373488,missed point follow close stunned actually mentioned sc validators chain sanctioning ,
373489,can't even send eth sure button inactive ,eth inactive 
373490,metamask issue,
373491,rollback metamask version,
373492,ok thx use op enough justify lazy atm ,
373493,less tweets next time pls,time 
373494,restart ur computer,
373495,came across day using brave worked switched browsers firefox,
373496,ye using brave may issue indeed,
373497,metamask brave many silly bugs 0 05% desktop pc users use brave browser doubt consensys bothered fix soon,doubt 
373498,try seed pkey rabby wallet work issue ,seed wallet work 
373499,brave always oddities large proportion ui bugs reported us brave ,
373500,low users bugs bad combo getting stuff fixed promptly ,
373501,anyone using build brave wallet saw add custom rpc aswel,wallet 
373502,iirc absolute terms brave low number users terms crypto think brave reasonable share cohort,crypto 
373503,plus quickest way get things fixed tweet ceo pretty much first line support kek,
373504,impossible add custom rpc meta mask days,
373506,i'm pretty active years never problems brave fwiw usually slow rpc infura downing problem,
373507,tinfoil hatting ath,ath 
373508,add never connects,
373509,brave firefox,
373510,means broken endpoint usually,
373512, ,
373513,use pocket network rpc service,
373514,tool switch rpclist dot info similar chainlist baked decentrilized rpc service infura,
373515,pocket better infura decentralized censorship resistant right ,
373516,think,
373517,3 2 1 ,
373518,please explain recent statement ,
373520,yes know,
373521,everything us based get us huge market decentralized space ffs serve anywhere world staying anon,market 
373522,yet still insisting decentralized censorship resistant ,
373523,portal one ways host team use pokt,
373524,months use sdk visit pokt relay portal number limit 3000 dapp space new dapp ,dapp dapp 
373525,dapp use sdk stake get relay ,dapp stake 
373526,criticize pokt think architecture designed fine imo,
373527,well dev arrested netherlands ,
373528,us sanctions propagates throughout whole space ,
373529,little difficult explain dapp use portal service try make clear 1 v0 version pokt protocol free dapp still needs stking pokt generate endpoint team decide give subsidy demand side limit bcs free 2 pokt early stage design decentrilized perfect better wen v1 version ,dapp protocol dapp 
373530,also dao decide protocol's feature future declaration core team include portal dont see propasal ban tornado protocol layer ,protocol protocol 
373531,try bullish pokt try figure real situation happended means ,
373532, ,
373533,new drama,
373535,velodrome like,
373540,wait send gifs,
373542,yo hope etc get activity going thought process eth mining pools shitload capital locked equip assumign ethpow dump pleb one day story miners go etc start actively stimulating development community buildors etc ,eth mining 
373543,thoughts ,
373544,typical,
373550,lol,
373551,haha,
373552,ivan ban soon,
373556,supply could creat demand ,
373557,dont wanna get banned ivan continue ur shitpost ur,
373568,hence incentive part,

373571,find list banned addresses ,addresses 
373572,ofac ws,
373573,dune analytics dashboard,

373586,also umm researching first thoughts work needed adapt contracts higher gas fees compared eth alternatives eth pretty far ahead tech wise,work gas eth eth 
373587,looks like akula's chainspec format except akula guess,format 
373588,wonder end drama tho maybe even etc people discuss unironically easy censoring pos transactions ,pos transactions 
373589,wrong context,
373590,exactly nick says actually easier censor transactions gabriel initially thought,transactions 
373591,issue anyway ,
373592,hi,
373593,bribe,
373594,oh ,
373595,ivan,
373596,gabriel understands easy talking something else,
373597,point easy censor transactions pos doomed,transactions pos 
373598,easy pow thing lexnode concerned impossibility plausible deniability attest blocks incur inactivity leak,pow 
373599,governments could blanket ban tx compliant chain starting block x,chain block 
373600,realised publishing every version app ipfs that's super nice transparent user hope protocols future ,ipfs 
373601,like building upon chain includes sanctioned tx violating sanctions,chain

373751,wtf lol,
373753,almost like actually create web3 social platform time,time 
373754,yes ui gets published transparently github actions course creating frontend without centralization point trivial task reality moment stack allowing complete decentralization get better still,decentralization 
373755,personal opinion people still bit understanding challenges even trying achieve full decentralization course mistakes things improve lot teams trying push thar direction right thing ,decentralization 
373756,systems like decentralized governance huge endeavour especially non technical side,governance

373828,yeah details check link specifically ,
373829,what's vxtwitter btw ,
373830, baserow smartsheet coda zenkit monday zoho creator rows directus grsit dbeaver anyone used databases one would recommend,
373831,way link twitter without worrying previews telegram stroke twxtter com vxtwitter com shows text addition images videos tweet,twitter 
373832,none use databases elaborate little intend store like project management stuff that's ,
373833,sorry simple clean ui display clean data like airtable example sure send images here's link ,data 
373834,monday might closest airtable trello baserow,
373835,regarding data project management i'm looking databases,data 
373836,use dbeaver regularly w psql behind tho,
373837,term ur looking cms ,term 
373838, data databases really supposed exposed frontend like,data 
373839,content management platforms,
373840,yea shit job describing looking would guys recommend content management platforms preferably free ,
373841,posterboard inkjet printer string,
373842,great,
373843,sorry trying flame really use case database traditional sense platforms wrappers top database allow interact data present,data 
373844,pay,
373845,still costs host database,
373846,flaming guys showing proper terminology fine saw say databases airtable went,
373847,yea think i'll probably end using notion google sheets switch airtable,
373848,yea gotcha mean really depends trying store want use features need pay fee,
373849,probably paranoia actually feds sliding folks dms saying u ,
373850,depending many records trying work notion kind crap pretty bad performance hundred rows google sheets probably much better start ,work 
373851,also notion kind relying 3rd parties like zapier etc automated things,
373852,essentially i'm trying create data vc funding rounds also create profiles vc project,data 
373853,i'm going manual first eventually write script automate updates manual review publishing,
373854,seems like need crm,
373855,define bad address ones backed identity define set bad acitivities ,address identity 
373856,problem making separate profiles fund project google sheets would shit notion bad,fund 
373857,erp whatever call,
373858,i'm sure exact terminology that's problem haha know need able build clean chart preferably colours categories create profiles,
373859, look pictures website looks pretty ideal tbh also grist labs problem scaling it'll cost realized self host wont ,self 
373860,case working many records notion clunky handle basics scaling going cost things though go managed service,cost 
373861,since baserow option self hosting ,self 
373862,would also look nocodb airtable like experience polished ui wise seemed good feature wise,
373863,noticed haha probably going go options first well wanted see people use familiar ,
373868,context tweet whatever trm says bad e tornado users,e 
373869,i'm looking see define really talk tornado cash continue define bad addresses bad activities case case prob sets dangerous precedent controlled idk clear headed us government matters whether continue future i'd much comfortable regulators clearly defining bad means least providing set principles people play games like tradfi ,cash addresses government 
373870, clearly defining heh underestimate value ambiguity,
373871,i'm i'm pointing terribly could go people stay top especially influence ambiguity plays basically implicitly asking what's done ,
373872, terribly could go people stay top that's point fear wonderful tool,
373873,things left vague open ended reason even things defined we've already seen last weeks sec happy reach anything determine fit definition,
373874,operating assumption government currently well orchestrated entity everything clear cut following rules means okay sadly mistaken ,government 
373875,good fin ,
373876,yes vcs make money also fund innovation market decides need product seems clear products like need therefore valuable humanity market people willing pay vc make money real issue web3 shitty tokens funding community years clearly need ,money market product market money tokens 
373877,ah yes enlightened vcs startups seen light know true innovation fintech knockoffs,
373878,innovative web3 web2 completely dubious blockchain component that's okay humanity someone wants talk knowing space ,blockchain 
373879,easy speak innovation innovate anything space ,
373880,truly fin ,
373908,think completely midunderstanding points know i'm exactly consensus group maybe point get across i'll try make explicit attach citations needed 2 things 1 regulators remain vague projects putting pretty risky position ability influence they'll good intelligence direction they'll go either influence short end stick go know going avoid deduceable critical thinking citations needed buy logic ask someone works works sro managing regulatory relations see corroborate 2 definitions principles good places iterate side note originate regulators need adopted regulators plenty channels industry influence iterative process ie sro appeal ogc 1 like something regulators file lawsuit 2 3 also may choose flock towards rival regulators la lummis gillibrand bill chamber digital commerce cftc chamber digital commerce membership btw 4 1 1st paragraph assists preparing commission opinions 2 3 4 ,points consensus digital digital 
373909,vcs fund projects one hand fund kyc startups another one massively diluting value proposition shitty advice give shit decentralization never look vc poisoned projects say look actions excess profits double dipping equity dumping retail go bribe regulators become new incumbents regulatory moat building behind closed doors would never allow hobbyist dev participate exact play unfolded many times gambling social media example ,fund fund kyc one decentralization
