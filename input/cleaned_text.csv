321966,votium voting protocol please specific
321967,would call protocol like votium
321968,excellent
321969,also interested exists offering complex features proof token ownership time interval say want prove someone holding tokens 1000 consecutive blocks
321970,bribing voting power mean voting broad term
321971,check aragon
321972,
321973,
321974,much competition yet
321975,one aave grant
321976,use graph queries snapshots tally yet shipped iirc zodiac looks pretty cool
321977,graph queries work onchain
321978,tried failed understand graph times care admit
321979,mean bribe havent looked votium votemak left besides see winner takes sector
321981,
321982,basically want query balances blocka balances blockb edge points interval could use merkle trees provable balances accepted smart contracts want whole interval also meet condition wallet x token balance always z ofcourse could build merkle tree every block inbetween seems like hugely inefficient maybe even impossible solution range gets big smart contract can't iterate verifying since limited gas
321983,snapshot even close
321984,vote bribing
321985,votium pmf convex anything else work votemak core events
321986,pmf
321987,voter extractable value sounds interesting idea concept chance though

321995,ok thx updated docs
321996,well i'm audit peer review code guess need update wording little
321997,maybe query excluding address existing transfer events interval mean graph expert doable appropriate subgraph
321998,code quality good bad ser

322219,
322220,yes chose work bad actors
322221,whole point regulation exclude bad actors participating certain economic activities
322222,i'm speaking general mim

322232,nice
322233,thanks sharing
322234,thanks sharing really helps nondev people understand concept still understand efficient though
322238,part efficiency saving storage space eg right eth transaction means storing full call params chain that's prove really sending tokens zk proofs theory store proof tokens transfered without ever need store transaction details
322239,that's also roughly zkrollups work
322240,provided zero knowledge proof 10 year old girl alright
322246,lot people use aztec found tech really interesting early days would guess got high liquidity likely better designed tornado practically tho might hard compete tornado anonymity set

322254,yep l1s suffer issue least going multichain sharding approach seen leaders space properly talk issue vitalik keeps dusting issues couch strongly relying l2s can't seem find immediate solution long run important questions short term much users care
322255,long term l1s become used l2s fragmentation
322256,fwiw im glad least l1 project eth thats idealistic rest justifiably cutting corners
322257,glad see spectrum play
322258,btc maxis would disagree p
322259,perspective
322260,tradeoffs
322261,l2s suffer fragmentation scalability limitations essentially blockchains multiple l2s means liquidity usage fragmented across ledgers
322262,l1s cutting corners except eth
322263,believe winner take scenario
322264,anyone know arbitrum went twice btw write report reason
322265,sure especially finance people follow yield married ledger currently l2s scalability limitations get congested split another l2
322266,follow yield follow utility
322267,follow yield
322268,arbitrum estimated 40 tps max think solana including fake tps atm l2 impressive scalability
322270,follow yield
322271,follow money
322272,privacy chains underutilised conundrum privacy tech always late realise need privacy need volume work one person wearing mask public doesnt help much everyone wearing much harder figure whos end tornado much ahead
322273,source comparative analysis l2s actually perform impression arbitrum better
322274,eh maxis much exist
322275,understand method name
322276,make human readable
322277,try 
322278,thanks found 
322279,trying google stuff terrible resources can't even find simple tps comparison smart contract tps usually much lower
322280,maybe therea registries 
322281,dune maybe
322282,layer 2's race 0 gas throttling tps anyways sorta like judging wet paint
322283,blabla redacting
322284,convo stops usual couch stuff feel free share unbiased much possible data thats
322286,couch stuff 3
322287,ur kinky stuff
322288,lol admins days alex dick

322295, made single slide excel sheet simply came us extreme conviction done lot outsidein research gave us offer couldnt refuse said 
322299,hi andre saw fantom giving dapp blockchain relatively new seems using horizontal scaling solution fantom solved scalability issue giving application blockchain similarly running application different computers part network blockchain independent one another custom tokens tokenomics governance rules
322300,hey new chromia similar design dapp sidechain everything settled mainchain top sideschains chromia ibc similar cosmos trade nft's data tokens one
322302,hi sorry meant whether new fantom dont remember scaling direction would love see details also great see blockchains exploring horizontal scaling vs vertical l2 scaling eth
322303,good 
322304,anyone knows fantom listed solana ecosystem web andrecronje
322305,new least homepage last month mention 
322306,sorry dont ftm think done stealthily
322307,meant chromia thing
322309,actually quite best kept secret
322310,would appreciate anyone links details thanks

322368,see fair criticism thats put
322370,likely joke
322371,feel ser can't expect shit billion dollar project
322372,'smart contract platform' mean evm
322373,details wait till like waiting solidly tokens pointless talk till
322374,one doc folder released
322377,looking connect anyone coinhippoio custom dashboard needs anyone connect would awesome

322389,weth that's exploited
322390,wormhole eth exploited
322391,twilio number might get flagged a2p look 
322392,offering like 03% money whitehat bounty
322393,u taking 10mil fellas 
322394,fuckin pennies alameda
322395,soeth seems ok tho
322396,counter w 15m
322397,yeah shouldnt soeth practically worthlesstake huge haircut
322400,
322401,behind closed doors anyway
322403,doesnt exist anymore lol
322404,whatever synthetic wormhole eth deriv called
322405,soeth sollet eth
322406,play borrow soeth sell
322407,case id still expect contagion
322408,wat soeth related wormhole eth
322409,anything pumps people dump wormhole eth soeth
322410,isnt get side
322411,
322412,wormhole eth soeth
322413,afaik
322414,whats ticker wormhole eth
322415,im guessing nobody solana rn wants holding synth eth
322417,wheth
322418,wormhole eth solana eth lol
322419,ticker eth
322420,mms getting picked holy shit
322421,muh orderbook dex
322422,that's raydium think
322423,anyways want borrow wormhole eth sell
322424,yes
322425,solend
322426,nfa
322427,war room around time ami missin somethin
322428,holly shit
322429,honestly price crashing better play probably buy believe full backstop corporate overlords
322431,
322432,potential
322433,wait exploited real eth 
322434, maintenance 
322435,need give least 10% discussion countless times allowing pointless
322436,potentially
322437,another day another 9 figure exploit
322438,yes backing wormhole eth wiped
322440,'the hacker' receive initial eth tornado
322441,wormhole eth falls might play buy hoping alameda drops lunch money cover hack doesnt fall play borrow solend sell hoping pay back loan cheaper
322442,portal's web
322444,mean backing wheth
322445,could effects solana defi imagine
322446,yes
322447,seems like jump crypto might suffer largest loss theyre ones reached hacker
322448,seems quite time contract deployment funding tornado actual drainage tool spoke could detected issue would playbook cant stop contracts every time shit happens somebody messing would even pause unpause given dont even know issue yes banteg nvm eoa eth side
322449,solend mkt rn wormhole eth top correct
322450,probably wrapped eth chains backed eth eth exploited trying figure exploit rn looks bad tho
322452,ppl wondering even audit info
322453,
322454,noob effectively mean double spend wrapped eth protocols react time
322455,
322456,
322457,ahhhhhhh
322458,waiiiiit audit commited 2 hours ago
322459,test production sir
322460,didnt get much reply yesterday anybody using vue 2x web3 good combo opinion
322461,much wheth
322462,added pdf 2 hours ago pdf says 10th jan 2021
322463,ouch 
322464,seem like right contract 
322466,lets drag devs mud either happens everyone hard time forking larp devs real builders lets support least add oil fire
322467,solana bridge hacked
322468,
322469,maybe that's went hacker must created signature function wrapandtransfereth without actually sending tokens token bridge directly published message core bridge contract one supported chains message gets signed vaa generated guardians used signedvaa call completetransfer function bridge contract
322470,use ethersjs
322471,tool catch attacker deploy contracts
322472,hacker's completetransfer transaction 
322473,yup added end message question would stand even case
322474,regarding vue i've used nfts works fine problems ran
322475,
322476,
322477,use ethersjs something vue specific
322479,
322480,ethersjs maybe disadvantage fewer codebases look compared react
322481,checkout raydium ui solana tho
322482,
322483,solend borrow limit eth capped allowing borrows
322484,
322485,
322486,wow
322487,wormhole eth ftx withdrawals still working
322488,ftx effectively backstopping right
322489,liquidity prob last though
322490,wow vitalik tweet straight prophetic given wormhole stuff basically wrote exactly happened
322491,yes
322492,vitalic daddy
322493,brains guy
322494,probably thinks aboyt crypto 247
322495,could plan person thst found loophole within worm
322496,
322498,unless whitehat wish countless way wash hard timeconsuming possible dont condone crimes
322501,wonder someone ever take one exploits high court ruling project happy sweep rug
322504,
322506,
322507,whoever makes mistake head pays pocket italian rhyme
322508,solana contracts open source
322509,anything coming hope
322512,bridge running years nearly 10bn volume 500m continuously custodied 0 downtime 0 hacked
322513,shilling ico ser
322514,one knows exactly happening kind exploit peoples funds risk time speculate shill alternatives
322515,
322516,cue ren plug
322517,annnnd got 
322518,name 1 one unhacked bridge kek
322519,haha yeah ur welcome
322520,never good idea piss dying body agree thats true indeed
322521,i'm idiot didnt claim 2 lobster nfts time ivangbi didnt even help friend need sats scrounge
322522,disagree actually think unethical shit hastily constructed risky alternatives less uptime worse track records yeah i'll chill gl affected can't imagine hacker return funds bounty
322523,think thats result toolchain
322524,definitely want piss jump ftx alamoeba resources extort pressure find guy sure counter 20 mil take money
322527,whereas eth contracts written solidity solana write another language compile bytecode
322528,well know they're rust wasm never explored kind assumed eth model verifying contracts via etherscan similar would still stand
322529,wormholes code github
322530,far he's still skipped court date tried searching local news nothing yet time tell
322532,looks like theres code explorersolanacom
322533,
322534,find code 
322535,holy shit guys stupid
322536,could come hack tho
322537,didnt check
322538,would weird lol
322539,hack similar duplicated chains wormhole supports
322540,couldve bought binance kyc 30 telegram groups tho
322541,yep true
322542,quick underestimate
322543,group lol x
322544,dont think anybody knows yet
322545,there's bunch sell kycd accounts every exchange also allocations sales
322546,we're waiting info come easy speculation
322547,
322548,transactions came hack looks like randos
322549,
322550,bunch people sending tx askimg money
322551,
322555,
322556,dropped 20% earning market close
322557,dumb question tornado blacklist addresses
322558,much worth
322559,without protocol upgrade
322560,gotcha could helpful situations
322562,
322564,designed helpful cases hacking focused privacy
322565,true facts
322566,idea somehow prevent things consistently sort reactive monitoring silly imho attackers figured conditions watching work around may work twice everyone celebrates cease work
322569,wormhole hacker gonna give away randos
322570,could risk user assets solana ecosystem bridged wormhole weth 
322571,imagine unsuspecting shitcoin trader fbi blows door hacker decided taint wallet proceeds 320m hack 
322572,probably got inspired sam charity
322573,
322574,nice theory false lead 
322575,buy tarantino nfts
322576,
322577,deposit tornado directly doxx
322578,transaction question like 1 dollar lol
322579,
322580, tornado cash 1eth transaction
322581,seems like function exploited 
322582, thats one
322583,ah thats one link binance see
322584,thats noise
322585,btw issue hack also attacker coud drain wormhole eth paired trading pairs across solana protocols understand correctly vulnerability based able mint wormhole eth
322586,havent read entire conversation dumb take privacy sake privacy need justify tornado
322588,weth oasis protocol going fine weth seems bridged wormhole well
322589,want privacy sake privacy needs default otherwise thing good hacking getting blacklisted cexes try offramp
322590,maybe earlier sql dump chain they're loading 
322591,think sol 
322592,horrible take also opinion also dangerous
322593,sucks true
322594,ever try depositing coinbase tornado funded wallet
322595,someone wants privacy dont end target shouldnt end pigeon holed hackerscammer
322596,yeah way avoid privacy default
322597,
322598,free money brave enough
322599,practice privacy default always easy tornado counterparts make user friendly way protecting
322600,specific privacy default mean something like zcash transactions layer need private people choose privacy centralized entities going discriminate
322601,like imagine zcash rollup smart contracts
322602,case rollup acting tumbler would interested another great innovation would private bridging
322603,
322604,one says required use cexs b c using tornado though
322605,people also use bucc tornado
322606,mean want offramp going touch regulated participant eventually
322607,really willing pay fee things like local monero
322608,pretty funny
322609,lol holy shit 
322610,solana safest l1
322611,sbf singlehandedly saving solana
322612,everything safe
322613,attackers asking 5% whitehat bounty return money hope wormhole takes deal much better precedent handling future hacks
322614,see
322615,source 
322616,
322617,wait shit maybe read wrong way
322620,rekt
322621,believe that's wormhole trying bribe return funds
322622,certus offering herhim
322623,thats bad wormhole deployer offering bounty sorry
322624,wormhole well established product ive away
322625,back
322626, eth added next hours ensure weth backed 11 
322627,damn someone pull 120k eth outta wallets hour
322628,'tis scratch lol
322629,right that's wormhole making offer someone backing seriously big way make claim here's hoping comes
322630,pocket change people billions 
322631,jumpftx
322632,1 charity less donate going donate wormhole foundation
322633,yes native bridge used everyone bridging solana
322634,actually worked pretty good specially stable coins chain swaps sollet using wormhole
322635,shit maybe ive used typically use anyswap
322636,anyswap existent mean first early bridge
322637,ah ok thank
322638,also think ftx using exchange swaps sure
322639,shush voncent
322640,fuck would come
322641,got hacked
322642,
322643,idk happened like 3 times
322644,hold lemme get source tp make sure
322645,
322646,nasty thing one affected approvals
322647,basically anyone ever approved bnb bunch tokens vulnerable get accounts drained
322648,best prefix multichain hack old news want freaking 
322651,yea lol
322652,think people freaking tbh
322653,much money unsecured copy paste code platform
322654,talking wormhole necessarily
322655,thorchain got hacked ago
322656,10 days old
322659,jesus thats exactly revoke permissions
322661,dev news highly recommended 
322662,safe see anyswap multichain debank revoke permissions know i've used protocol another way manually
322664,permanent exploit anyone gave approval old multichain contracts weth peri omg wbnb matic avax check whether affected 
322665,details 
322666,jump
322667,governance maybe sure
322668,day happens day project dies incredibly quick death
322669,say gave solana chance everytime used painful issues network downoverloaded whole better ux even high tps narrative solana utter bullshit better l1 certainly far worse many
322672,think problem entire eth scaling model everything needs bridged long term security issues like one
322680,site
322681,heard ftx footing bill
322682,doesnt seem like hard make open secure bridge least secure kind hack
322683,
322684,note solana part eth scaling model l1 trying relevant bridging assets ultimately homed eth
322685,doesnt derive security eth depends
322686,im saying eth l2s wont experience similar pains least wont centralization risks youre taking ease one trilemma legs
322687,note sc bug problem bridge model couldve happened bridge like anyswap
322688,yep although standard open bridge contract evm would usable evm based chain wouldnt rewrite every time
322689,anyswap os still ran bug
322690,sure fixed bug contract right
322691,future l2s use fixed contract hopefully make mistakes new ones
322692,yes everyone uses anyswap anyways case solana cant use since rust
322693,open source isnt magic bullet means bugs fixed anything bad happens prevent bugs reoccurring use current best version anyone think contain collective knowledge people white black hatting time
322695,
322696,huge
322697,
322698,
322699,think cheap revoke every approve costs gas amount approving
322700,guess whether want save couple dollars risk balances wiped
322701,could always approve much spend think need instead infinite approvals
322702,wow ur everywhere
322703,seen u bao finance gmx
322704,sure thing tx amount gas approval
322705,
322706,building citadaoio bring real world asset onchain
322707, youtuber feature us recently
322708,wow incredible true
322709,team knew exploit weeks 
322710, anybody understand borrowing synth would increases capital efficiency lending protocol requiring asset lent present protocol
322711,search method nice injoke
322712,protocol elswhere potential useful guess
322713,wonder recourse work
322714,doesnt really means liquidity different place concentrated amm synth target
322715,isomorphic
322716,hey guys wanna check whore owner mutisig address check thanks
322718,wheth price dumped 11 solana blockchain
322719,think that's 2 different topics 1 bridge comparisons 2 stable coin multichain policies
322720,yes probably problem get solved 'practical 'terms example subways bridges connecting skyscrapers chains city metaphor chains may fail get delayed usefull time see alexnear tweet 
322721,yup 2 diff topics resource either that'd great tks
322722,normal lending protoool even liquidity i'm trying figure instead old boring stuff borrow eth directly
322723,normal lending protocols liquidity
322724,protocol reserves dai compound aave isnt lent
322725,functionally compound could think borrowing cdai immediately trading dai compound protocols builtin cdaidai amm lenders actually forced split lent dai lending providing dai amm latter earning interest thats one reasons theres spread lending borrow rates compound
322726,interesting know intermediate token compound leave two questions though token lend dai directly asteria different compound
322727,im sorta speaking schematically dunno compound actually cdai step functionally
322731,one reason separate intermediate token transforms problem determining optimal amount reserves hold designing amm synthetic target latter something may better
322732,wonder eth originates since unclear diagram depending exactly works could etheth 9010 amm sounds dangerously close reserve banking tbh
322733,make sense thanks answers 
322734,interesting mechanics
322735,implicit compound amm basically cdai dai current redemption rate plus tiny fee iirc
322736,constant sum curve
322737,instead curve curvature may trading little target use set interest rate
322738,rai works
322739,dai matter
322740,compound maker builtin constantsum amm
322741,guess maker sorta latter psm
322742,psm constant sum tho right flat fee personally prefer stableswap functionality
322743,basically bonding curve would smth like greenred bars fees rate differences borrowing xy
322744,reserve factor built interest accrued redemption rate point swapping cdai dai fee
322745,ya like stableswap concentrated liquidity price discovery nice
322746,thought hilariously small fee
322747,hopefully share experience building router protocol group know issue builder proceed cautiously even think cool product huge latent demand continuously want get one audit one pen testing process done opening alpha letting loose likes samczsun tob etc platinum names booked foreseeable future big wellfunded projects large funds zero bandwidth look small guys like us think might slightly differentiated approach meantime investors community want product updates immediately like yesterday also matter audits current big vendor model completely flawed terms incentive alignment even largest names worked almost basically maximising billing real skin game critical bugs router discovered independent white hat hackers daos like immunifi also struggling talent service demand
322748,
322749,
322750,would give hacker edge mev race
322752,exact q yes maybe hope nobody else looking messed bad code w proper testing give time edge others figure
322753,would need farm fork
322754,real defi protocol
322755,
322756,maybe could weird time hope nobody else necessary liquidity available short notice
322757,seems risky
322758,investigator definitely gonna suspect liquidator
322759,cause familiar protocol liquidators already connected easy connect youd love mev cause u r even playing field
322760,permissionless middleman
322761,several liquidator bots use flashloans 
322762,yeah need somewhere arb
322763,saw recently sometimes fail surprising ways extreme circumstances
322766,investigation concerns even matter hacker north korean state sponsored actor
322767,agree totally audit companies maximizing billables often great job anyway tbh used audits gemz exact reason fill gap profit taken stuff auditors got sniped big boys 
322768,work wish auditors thats dont generalize way ser
322769,oh clear we'd independent free audits find exploits vulns alreadyaudited contracts report projects yes wanna call names generalized bad ser p indeed good
322770,ah c thank u clarifying ser
322771,remember major auditing company ever refunded project audited hacked examples
322772,neither
322773,eh hard say guess usually guarantee safety check best ability hence getting several probably best choice though today's rates that's possible many projects
322774,also farfetched insider could exploiting vulns they're fixed quick enough sure isnt high suspect list along inside job
322775,conspiracy theories lead absolutely nothing fruitless
322776,correct yes try best logos much care security end day one predict see especially new experimental stuff
322777,ya true absolutely crazy thought would never happen 
322778,gain much insight audit team code open anyway ask questions discord dev team yes understand teams security policy better huge edge anyway dumb conspiracy really pisses leads nothing proposes nothing dev teams rug actually ye whatever good day ffs
322779,flashbots considered edge really gain edge
322780,true apparently vuln found audit conspiracy possibility
322781,mean one thing code open significance inflated otherwise another give someone idea issues information actually
322782,wrong coiner something make discussion cause dead end
322783,whats point proof information omitted auditor want discuss possibilities day directions
322784,ye point indeed u right
322785,case closed
322787, fin
322788,well beg question timing github commit fix vuln soon checked exact timing yet minutes hours still soon exploit occurred interesting timing making conspiracy theory thinking timing possible timing coincidental attacker rushed executing due seeing commit certainly raises questions pointing fingers party exploit brought forward born witnessing commit openness could issue case
322789, openness could issue dont open security stuff vulnerabilities know issue actually fixing thats issue openness thats common sense idk details case though doubt real reason dull
322795,security convos use ctrlf read bantegs ideas immunefi guys ideas samczsun others fin
322797,
322803,closing thought ivangbi indulge maybe time audit daos spearbit teams come together continuously go bug bounties form loose decentralised governance
322804,go bridging native network token fees without using exchange eg 1 eth eth network want bridge ftm network ftm ftm wallet side new ftm fees mostly using anyswap stable pools still need use exchange get native token fees yes thanks
322805,bridges add bit native token gas times faucets sometimes would buy ftm eth mainnet bridge first 
322806,perhaps buy ftm ethereum bridge idk treated native ftm fantom
322807,sometimes buy token cex withdraw blockchain buy ftm binance example
322808,use elk finance bridge convert elk native token deduct amount bridge
322809,multichainorg suport ftm avax asfaik times swap liquidity side stables work best gets stuck native side use exchange whole point ive bumped problem several times new networks wallets elk finance looks like solve supports different chains thanks 
322810,support avax ftm
322811,confirm though clear ui wftm thing fantom
322812,meant example want go polygon avax there's option via usdc pool native tokens it'll get stuck point avax wallet new avax fees withdraw usdc pool end
322813,yeah one biggest issues people trying start fresh wallet chains without cex limited possibilities getting enough native token get started may able bridge 100k usdc use cant pay gas
322814,done elk finance bridge elk token native swap
322815,yes much liqidity think combination elk fees multichain stable pools may work well great multichain includes form 'swap bridge' kind thing there's opportunity im sure im aware
322818,bridge avax token matic token several chains example buy matic binance withdraw bsc bsc bridge directly polygon
322819,multiple bridge airdrop gas token avax bnb matic pay first transaction nowadays synapse celer feature
322820,
322821,design aspect considered router estimate destination fee bake fee pay origination source could also meta transactions biconomy instance though yet many chains including bsc
322822,could also swap source chain whatever want destination chain
322825,hmm panicked secured funding investors 120k eth still attackers wallet interesting see technical writeup
322826,guessing sbf backed
322827,people think

322845,small bonus tip coingecko price feed curve's interface work
322846,sir sorry doubt lets look funds raised jump capital latest fund usd 350 mm typically vc funds see 45 years investment period 45 years harvesting period funds used pay mgmt fees 225% commonly make investments portfolio diverse enough 304050 deals 50% fail 2030% give back invested bets generate 10x make sure return rates totaling 34x therefore vc funds sitting piles cash plug gaps hacks also typically carried interest major part compensation spending usd 200 mm plugging exploit would hardly option also lp agreements investor fund restrict funds could spent cant imagine lpa allows spend money like

322853,ohh hi fren
322854,great see lots interoperability discussion happening layerzero help alot use cases
322855,hello good sir 
322856,yea definitely case started crypto division 2017 plenty capital bail subsidiary eyes wallet see eth moves
322858,cannot agree still dmed stop disc
322859,dex'es supporting crosschain swaps
322860,im talking bridges ofc
322861,rango
322862,use liquidity chains
322863,another dumb question jump backing 300m hack wormwhole eth buy eth anyone already found tx jump buying eths
322864,eg even swap fantom fantom it'd great use liquidity ethereum
322865,jump probably 300m eth sitting around
322866,fair enough see tx
322867,thanks i'll ask tg
322869,
322870,binance
322871,cool thanks clemensotto
322872,nice idea btw 
322873,hi guys price two different chains token 
322874,sorry ignorance guys best place get ust ethereum looking busd usdc ust send terra bridge
322875,curvefi best liquidity
322876,technically true doesnt mean best place swap less price impact uni v3
322877,thank guys already discussed ust peg anywhere main concerns ust lose peg usd
322878,use search discussed ad nauseam
322879,
322880,oof
322882,primordialaa right lol
322885,
322886,multi cross though
322887,lmfao sunk costs point
322888,long sol stays 100
322889,apparently crypto got point big fail
322890,print money collateral cant fail anymore
322891,go ask wonderland holders
322893,mad haters caused vice news write tan article us go tell haters what's good 
322894,incredible chad energy
322895,reading twitter reduces empathy levels every time guess ultimately fall solipsism humanity die
322896,basically reading script
322897,1 say something controversial 2 get reaction grow audience 3 4 profit
322898,sad that's lot accounts
322899,anyone seen good write ups threads dao treasury management pitfalls strategies
322901,sure wanna read really id say topic quite simple 1 mean managing usdc inside treasury always directional unless farm compoundaaveyearn safe old pools low risk decentralized much instead directional even delta neutral strategies offchain via mm risk liquidations taking subjective risk causing potential issues longevity treasury pretty much get sifu lmao 2 mean token side well cant much beg lending protocols accept collateral diversify treasury usdc dont go fanatic might sell much early balance also subjective
322902,one link think articel hasu great place start 
322903,another good write creator cabin dao 
322905,think maybe bit simpler basically started multisig dao fundraised community bit realizing like make revenue allocate investors multisig someone invests someone else like 'ownership' someone leaves dao invested multisig etc
322908,depends arrangements made far promised etc calling dao assume proportional
322909,tbh think using dao term loosely like gathering nft holders rare trait nft collection lol
322910,right done 05 eth contributions without able invest havent cross bridge yet
322911,big difference managing dao treasury certain treshold lets say 8 figures worth
322912,far find relatively good details projects operates big treasuries podcasts articles mostly projects sitting token treasuries sad
322913,maker bad 
322914,think predictable long ago rune said maker wants see real world assets collateral
322915,ever get tired rejecting system brought fatf bullshit wef cunts everything broken constantly arguing opposed spending peanuts 15k mo looking something basic feasibility study surely must get tiring
322916,point defi intersect tradfi
322917,everyday stray god
322918,opinions performant way package react component update rapidly imagine orderbook 'refreshing' milliseconds
322919,purple pill
322920,simpler times
322922,patrizia also holds certificate advanced studies blockchain university zurich
322928,feel like us wielding power defi worst possible way banks comply fatca yet decentralized protocol isnt subject legislation must comply us issued regulations reason exactly penalty noncompliance us going block defi sanction wonder us govt needs grant research program research feasibility nonsense first place instead demanding everyone comply demands based pipe dream wanting total taxation citizens matter live
322929,could clever person please explain what's wrong lusd seems liquity can't implement kyc
322930,wouter says research every research purpose imo indicative plans 
322931,notice cannot change dai contract without shutting whole system
322932,call got pressured taking public action show compliance
322933,dai pro
322934,dao's teams want make sure go jail launching
322935,purpose usually comply avoid compliance well
322936,wonder prove can't comply would best possible outcome
322937,makerdao one best decentralized projects
322938,mean doesnt make sense curious would done become compliant current system compliant going easy become compliant maker may want start funding llcs contributors shield liability
322939,car become compliant rules written horses
322940,truly hope outside scope core protocol esm super scary think case share discomfort
322941,never wondered power measured horsepower ser
322942,still humans engineered car
322943,writing code crime ser
322944,humans get targetted
322945,amen
322946,find exactly whyhow horse law apply cars figure reconcile two systems push change
322947,ended calling engine force horse power
322948,well latest fixed income leaders summit defi key topic discussion
322949,positive way
322950,still scary og protocols contemplating building stuff like
322951,totally agree eventually defi going come fork either completely sovereign meat space cannot governed nation states nation states going figure impose everyone's gonna figure cope still know way things going end important build understanding would cope things take turn towards worst
322952,governance always bug
322953,we'll know last time 33 turned time number goes spine defi
322954,people always capitulate family
322955,imo second path otherwise contributed building orwellian dystopian state
322956,either abide laws laws second one impossible
322957,shit makes sense
322958,fixed income leaders already strategising planning integrate defi
322959,insider info reveal
322960,check attendees last fixed income leaders summit london
322961,ty
322962,kinda prisoners dillema project making compliance moves
322963,also check speakers lol
322965,defi always alternative escape route wish make sure universally loved can't easily attacked
322966,ser yess ser
322967,yes boss lead wonderland
322969,govts always impose regulations banks comply since live world requires large companies real money they'll bottle neck
322970,okok getting legally couchy
322971,quoting anything legalese think choke point onoff ramp fiat company defi project like aave level exist without needing ramp 
322972,look transient updates jotaivaltio good state libs find demos looking 60fps reactthreefiber
322973,considering kyc'd pro thing think particular issues
322975,ok boring end convo understand differences always golden middle different everyone blabla fin
322976,agreed
322977,% equitytokens early engineer expect crypto startup friend offered 025% backend lead 5 engineers company wondering that's low
322978,already 5 engineers personnel alongside doesnt seem improbable number early already try negotiate higher course 05% dont think getting 1% case
322979,that's pretty low
322980,company 2 months old engineers month two
322981,ye try 05% sure dont think 1% probable
322983,thanks
322984,also consider % tokens team maybe 5% 5% total good part team equity 6th engineer
322985,really 'defi' headed admiration dai 
322986,
322987,
322988,wen veamzn
322989,one size fits going end badly
322990,they're still keeping liquidity committee see like 2 guys usually decide everyone else vote i've seen discord channel hope gets voted would like 100% bribe system instead weird hybrid
322991,incredible lower low instead working removing centralized coins collateral going rabbit hole makerdao delegates vote kycaml put nail coffin ethereum would lose supposed backbone economy users warn delegates advance threaten undelegation rn 200m delegated 10% mkr guess proposal could expected marchapril depending findings
322992,yall flipping wig research easy
322993,banteg good looking bruh
322994,current defi dapps eventually split two parallel markets cedefi vs defi regulatory pressures become litmus paper guess might get quite surprised ends team
322995,crypto space united standing fatf regulators would nothing could
322996,remember trying get frax go exact opposite direction months ago getting us integrated tornado cash think still opted dai instead us unfortunately i'm personally super excited zkp's would allow stablecoins used fully private cash like aztec protocol tornado ever add us
322997,wouter explained thread imo context part forum post post makes look like maker compliance obligations working changing protocol research 
322998,srsly what's point defi pushing boundaries whole reason behind decentralized aspect
322999,united comes lobbying founders operators dapps decentralized enough time regulator knocks door might chose cedefi jail regulations litmus paper decentralization
323000,hope
323001,comes makerdao understand pros called recognized delegates wouldnt safer turned shadow ones
323002,really get statements reconcile selection aml tools makerdao demo conducted community review forum post
323003,okay explained even futher post question 
323004,still sure whole thing makes sense intention indeed use study aml tools guess still danger territory yeah sure would even kind research intention actually amlkyc point feel bit like gaslighting
323005,new ruling enacted someone conduct legal research
323006,whether funded maker dao
323007,likely end result makerdaos research compliance according fatf recommendation jurisdictions recognize main developers founders operators control influence activities within dapp recommend get identified virtual asset service providers vasps means imposing aml compliance fatf advises riskbased approach deal unhosted wallets compliant vasps either limiting transactions volumes entirely banning interactions blockchain analysis software programs however important tools assistance case vasps intend apply outright ban compliance officer suggest implementation travel rule solution like notabene vasps use notabene solution embed proofofnoncustodialwallet ownership product discover send receive fully compliant blockchain transactions vasp vasp directory proprietary multiprotocol switch set riskbased rules rules engine automate compliance scale manage travel rule data transfers compliance platform also implementation amlcft complianceanalysis tool blacklisting capabilities realtime protection malicious actors ability block suspicious users funds transacting
323008,sure new stablecoin rules though
323013,goal defi bring much capital possible institutions banks etc require amlkyc can't can't permissionless path ever want compliance ethereum right decentralized permissionless core dapps opt already provide compliant path money circulation better everyone future defi
323014,bring trillions liquidity cost majority capital locked behind kycaml legacy institutions comfortably nest extract rent point exercise weve last 5 years unclear capital come us playing rules way around
323017,scenario end two sets liquidity kyc liq one side defi liq wouldnt defi slowly gain dominance long enough time scale ask race bottom see regards feerent extraction protocols end able capture value add kyc would added costs would put disadvantage wonder partypool able exist kyc side defi side would end migrating defi essentially defecting stay kyc realm hope makes sense
323018,making kyc pool like aave institutional party subjectively believe cant touch defi money cause ur vague understanding aml cant go dex really anymore pay kyc pool however probably semikyc parties mms arb two make money
323019,believe 3rd parties arbing permissioned permissionless pool correct answer eventually market determined liquid one happened cex dex past 2 years
323020,arbs depend regulations develop govs might able shut pure defi even make ground imprison foundersteams cos protocol decentralized well ensure fiat offramps can't accept crypto deposits address interacted pure defi tornado prevent legit mm participating system
323021,well amms compatible vetoken model tbh others much
323024,sorry couch legal stuff prompt wave bullshit discussions redacted
323025,legal suggestion genuine questions understand opinions coming
323026,evidence aml work spent protected takes rights away people accreditation stuff total horseshit also infringe privacy say need privacy something illegal dead end dont argue ethics law stance lobsters makes useless conversations
323027,less opinions alpha please dont need debate basics human interactions cause would flood bring eth merge news 
323028,indeed 
323029,kyced defi actually make implementation challenges listed easier better tracking lower compliance costs global cooardination shared ledger
323030,b4 kyc'd defi leads enforcing accreditation bullshit preventing anyone actually anything edit i'm prokyc
323031,problem aml regulators cannot envision world tangible control things crypto enables zk checks balances scares
323032,totally agree nobody problem sensible kyc regime problem none gov fucks incentive open money playground
323033,yes lets please end see convo dumb couch stuff right need send hentai fin
323035,banteg summoned 
323036,love hentai
323038,genuinely understand hentai pic special enjoyment
323039,give ideas may go hardcore 
323040,might like similar style character 
323041,get point would revenue last time swap aggregator routed balancer introducing feature reduce token's float enough give utility still spend millions emissions getting close nothing back unfortunately
323042,ok enough hentai guys going ot messing vibe
323043,attempts make selfsustaining immutable nogovernance algostable samkazemian pointed earlier people always prefer stablecoin higher collateral ratio however collateral supply side always looking capital efficiency collateral fully owned protocol pressure make capital efficient set safe collateral ratio like 400% issue new stablecoins safe threshold collateral come collect fees usage add fees collateral build would slow fees usage slow accumulate collateral however demand strong high collateral surprises human intervention transparent data critical price point collatetal ratio goes 100% peg always hold critical point might break peg external markets though time truly decentralized stablecoins would enter circulation obstacle protocol selfsustainability price feed oracle imposes external point failure auctioning sales purchases stablecoin would internalize risks however come sufficiently good system avoid exploitation
323044,take look fei protocol pretty much they're 210% collateralized 692m protocol controllved value
323045,governance
323046,yessir governance decides allocate pcv eth however they've diversified lusd dai rai earn liqudiity providing lending markets actually recently merged rari protocol one first dao mergers etc
323047,suggesting
323048,ah gotcha gov stablecoin 
323049,rai liquity
323050,liquity needs people add collateral need check rai
323051,eth collateral afaik
323052,issue governance minimized stablecoins price performance actual product protocol unless devised god mechanism somehow never break 99% market conditions actually perform well important thing stable price
323053,protocols agnostic price stability like eth amms like uniswap whatever much immutable completely devoid form human input monthsyears without needing hard forks protocol upgrades product price stability entirely something else
323054,would mechanism suggest break way would collateral price crashes hard issue every algostable transparency high collateral one needs panic also crash immediate people start exiting collateral ratio nears 100% pump collateral remaining circulating supply system relying arbitrage mechanisms close 100% collateral ratio making lack collateral narrative makes unclear breaking point invites bank run
323055,hey banteg chance know q4 h2 financial report yearn published 
323056,transparency nogovernance high collateral ratio source price stability others dont
323057,mechanism wouldnt break 400% cr collateral located deployed 400% cr inside protocol controlled amm pairs token holders want deploy new collateral types want deploy 400% collateral smart contracts thats originally stored governance right
323058,hi notice staking contracts balance staked token sent back sender address different amount deposited example 
323059,exactly can't change room governance failure less risk collateral bank contract stablecoins redeemed eth
323060,well thats nice think protocol would serve narrow useful purpose stablecoin would able grow fast enough given capital inefficiency ability upgrade anything sounds like feature bug could become niche favorite groups want possible decentralized option sacrificing liquidity use cases
323061,probably token value equal staked token value like share staking pool
323062,yeah extreme stability risk minimization slow grow without donations though expecting long term banks accumulating somewhere already suggestion might resilient price feedmechanism
323063,long term bank doesnt make profit ability sounds like overcollateralized amm basically sounds like fei without dao governance like fei right mix governance overcollateralization
323064,public good might even competitive edge price pay profits
323065,agree governance good profits think contradicts stability financial markets overextend risk taking since forever
323066,governance profits decentralized decision making input parameters make stablecoin protocol cool idea
323068,interested hearing thoughts point usually someone already done something similar also economist dev 
323069,anyone heard team verifying contract security reasons 
323070,doesnt work 
323071,sounds like horse shit behind
323072,anything verifying code makes likely someone finds bug also exploits otherwise whyd put effort reverse engineer
323073,anons decent fund backing not3lau 88m cra contract 
323074,daryllautk darrenlautf sers blz fix bs save
323076,guys talking liquity see latest product idea 
323078,define much tokens reserved swaps happens need assets trade swap reserve 
323079,future defi algorithmic governance cant build systems without flexibility adaptability market constantly shaping reduce human participation protocols evolution
323080,1 working right basically methodology follows take chain trading volumes data curvefi vs tvl pool calculate % tvl utilised take value initial one add little surplus 5% plan continuously monitor pool operation increase decrease value necessary chain automation network handle researching exact mechanics adjustment 2 lusd order lusd tokenin stabal tokenout bigger available lusd amount remaining amount unstaked stability pool liquity ofc cost additional gas
323081,apparently unverified due ipfork preventionnot really sure feel tbh
323082,immutability lack human interaction feature bug immutability must somehow redefined
323083,one way surely use change via governance much user dev friendly however never truly resilient due human factor unchangeable protocol may redeployed needed trial error produces truly resilient protocols profitable easy public goods benefit everyone emphasized decentralized algorithmic stablecoin design highest stability achieved huge collateral ratio one wants tie much capital fees providing service stability enough compete opportunities however capital belongs protocol care opportunity cost solve incentive problem human backers would also governance definition less stable immutable contract great stablecoin needs predictable possible surprised people repeat mistakes tradfi first step
323084,central banks used clear backing dollar gold wanted keep inflation dollar stable possible modified version taylor rule proposed make predictable possible every turn stable predetermined predictable rules turned argument discretion needed see pattern usefulness governance depends application comes monetary stability unchangeable rules simplicity transparency trump discretion
323085,probably bad example back point since retirement gold standard us economy actually grew lot getting rid strict rules turned benificial
323086,dont know counterfactual debatable also achieved long term stability unwinding show costs also suggesting system stability fed bunch mandates
323087,sure what's redefined pretty straightforward one simply needs look makerdao vs liquity one neutered going handful dudes generous information twitter even look willingly voted become glorified usdc friends wrapping service actually impervious storytelling
323088,sup anyone got link forbes bloomberg article comparing turkish monetary policy ohm's can't find anywhere found thx
323089,interested send pls
323090,
323091,talking stability sure opportuniy costs immense getting back previous message said however capital belongs protocol care opportunity cost hen solve incentive problem someone provide liquidity protocol seeking higher returns less risks immutability leads inability adapt case attacks people trust code entirely lock money less yield opportunity protocol adapt market conditions doesnt sound tempting
323092,endless loop discussion vastly different opinions arguments better presented long form full context lost pls spare group chat take dms
323093,maybe didnt explain clear enough people dont put money yield use buy sell stablecoin fees collected protocol hence people care opportunity cost collateral
323094,

323182,daoprotocol paying aws host api
323183,often quite painful yes indexing solutions scale non trivial also yet convinced moat free hosted service deprecated well see things goes imo
323184,agreed defensibility tho big business even hard replicate competitors emerge
323185,didnt find productmarket fit dont customers
323186,developing inhouse indexers often starts happy path first big rock chain reorgs
323187,easy subgraph models public could build something similar understand data protocol level
323188,one wanting way users read interact dapp via api wanted write solution even good use time resources reading data node makes sense calling smart contract functions via api seems dangerous one could use web3ethers script would exposing pks level right clearly seem like scalable idea users said dapp
323189,graph competitors like covalent point time less decentralised focused custom data subgraphs indexes focused offering api query basic things like token balances like moralis ivan von tech's ugly mug unmarshal
323190,tried covalent way worse thegraph fact didnt find thegraph competitors except streamingfast streamingfast even less reliable

323193,really hard less decentralized graph
323194,fo sho im trying think end users perspective running custom script vs able hit subgraph seems like thegraph much sleek offering

323211,rules horsesomething somethinggasoline vehicles
323212,ordinary lending protocols kind bribing protocols governance tokens vitalik good post ago protected collateral euler real option governance token holders want borrow tokens
323213,ya like euler's protected lending feature different ways people helping unlock liquidity governance participants guess moreso talking philosophical implications selling votesbribing topic always tradfi less since almost impossible separate voting rights shares
323214,think camp people defi much despiseshates governance bribingvote selling legitimate points unless there's new tokenomics innovations think current status quo converge people selling gov votes cash flow bribing platforms mature take neutral stance whether good direction stuff going tho seems clear
323215,funny went making fun eos bribing going lol

323336,something happening ethereum net can't make transaction fantom working tho weird
323337,gas war karafuru mint
323338,likely gas price 38 gwei eth 
323339,yea infura rpc seems
323340,oh ok use another rpc list somewhere
323343,looking gotta lookup quiknode alchemy
323346,polygon also seem work
323347,use pocket rpc
323348,
323349,great thanks
323350,camouflagedshill
323351,rly sometimes u use pokt rpc cause works
323352,never issues poky really recommended
323353,simple tool use send onchain message via tx someone tutorials find outdated metamasks ui royal pain ass
323354,i'm short writing tool purpose make public others dont go bullshit process oneclick ui somewhere i'll use
323355,u checked mailchainxyz tool already repo 
323356,might wrong etherscan's blockscan chat feature 
323358,perhaps 
323359,send normal tx 0 eth message hex data
323361,tool like 
323363,ja tools found dont convert right format definitely doesnt trick tx gets rejected
323364,ok thanks seems like onbrn thing want
323365,merci 
323366,eth network unusable right stupid
323368,infura rpc problems
323369,ah thx metamask also broken
323370,metamask uses infura
323371,sigh
323372,gas estimations wrong cant even cancel pending txs
323373,use rpc u r observing problems ethereum 
323374,
323377,i've tried including pokt still cannot send tx keep getting inherent gas low
323378,lol current gas 53 gwei tells long story decentralized effectively
323379,alchemy works
323380,lemme try
323381,use frame instead metamask change one click recommend use opportunity give try
323382,even w pokt metamask calculates ur gas spending wrong manually input like 5 priority 200 whatever currently base fee worked
323383,
323384,
323385,u meed pokt use rpc
323386,similar setting matic arbitrum
323387,thank
323390,ctrld 1 message redacted
323392,guys think looksrare survive halving
323393,im totally sure able get volume users long run im selling yes think okay
323394,opensea often regardless looks emission right
323395,agreed think possible personally listing stuff looking every time entrenched habits opensea need start offering though
323396,youre inexperienced navigate barely advanced metamask functionality dont make general infrastructure comments require broad nuanced knowledge enough serious decentralization bottlenecks space atm need throw invalidmisleading ones
323397,yes hype right comes apr
323398,apr drops much price drop lot also make normies leave
323399,mean nft owners arent experts crypto
323400, maybe better opinions
323401,im hyped owning part revenue marketplace using list stuff look every time buy sell network effect obviously im going buy worse nft looksrare collections still bigger selection opensea pretty much cases
323402,wasnt intention dont think least correlation
323404,check
323405,whole point merely lots retail uses metamask rpc reflected network usage
323406,infuras dominance indeed concern dont manage send transaction metamasks gas estimation flawed due using infura
323407,agree still learning new things every day
323408,believe actually rather opposite things stop working people start digging working process may well end discovering infura things like pokt potential improvement due decentralization
323409,problem metamask ui imo quick way switch rpcs
323410,something like frame would ideal
323411,always reflexive way reflexive way temporary ponzinomics looksrare served purpose people trying app unfortunately kicked better product opensea
323412,wondering send transaction network automatically dropped 
323413,network rpc
323414,beware whales harvest looksrare apr whilst hedged token price via perps ftx spiritus add reflexivity way might well profitable weeks ahead though knows
323415,profitable funding rates
323416,1 issue like infura opensea single point failure since nfts draw data api believe gives big monopoly right looksrare volume wash trading rewards
323417,indeed today dug rabbit hole thanks figured invaluable
323418,instance erc 721 tokens 'drawing data' opensea sure thats case
323419,yeah nfts usually use opensea metadata uri unless minted opensea
323420,saw experiment guy making nft shown different different metadata assume depending yes look looking different os form rarible wallet one latest blog post can't find link back sorry saying os blocked api calls delisted specific nft nft blocked everywhere
323421,moxie one talked bit 
323422,jepsen radix dlt 10beta351 article comments
323423,testing five tennode clusters m5large instances saw transactions start timing little one request per second and goodput generally peaked 16 transactions per second 1 million tps yet away 
323424,oh
323425,werent radix like million tps sync demos like 3 years ago
323426,
323427,came pivot eos worse jepsen stuff pretty thorough
323428,ha oh dear
323429,damn seeing eos name
323430,btw guide template set local dev environment erc20 want play ohm contract without deploying testnet simulate bonding understand mechanics bit better
323431,actually math
323432,good question
323433,
323434,thanks lol weird coincidence searching brownie hearing bankless podcast's curve war episode
323435,imho talk retail frame would ideal client cycles rpcs hood finds working one uses pro mode whatever lets add custom ones
323437, rdx works asserts january 27 2022 identified safety issues fixed liveness issues individual transactions fixed one issue relating performance networks nonparticipating validators remains also report multiple test passes running hundreds thousands transactions across multiple test networks rdx works longer able reproduce resolved issues jepsen congratulates rdx works advances jepsen verified none rdx workss claims since end testing november 5 2021 
323438,sure what's point post know fully aware current network 1 shard advertised 50 tps higher tps sharded version 2 years roadmap live dan's rnd network legitimate question ask jepsen limit 16 higher expect public stress tests verify future
323447,point thing replying
323448,quoted jepsen analysis radix paid much apparent chagrin scathing would liked
323449,lets please end radix convo thx
323451,buidlorrrrs
323452,hi 
323453,hello ser great meet dm even though dm first promise scammer lol
323454,
323455,course i'll report back 
323457,using pool assets amounts determine exchange ratio pretty much like uni router guess without curve checking daieth exchange ratio would differ depending amount check wanted borrow x eth dai lower x youd get eth per dai higher makes sense lendingborrowing service hope time average pool readouts flashloaned oblivion quite surprised already provide public service api
323459,unrelated topic builders going thru hard times sometimes gets lonely fck u feel like sharing dm
323460,yeah try hardest stay telegram weekends
323461,gotta disciplined stay grounded reality times
323462,asked wanted live crypto hacker house could imagine anything worse able unplug i'd go insane surrounded endless defi nft chatter
323463,shit people hear work crypto like haha think dogecoin elon musk
323464,jfc leave alone really value ones sceptical give shit new cafe opening town
323465,ones see pastry go price like 25c say damn world's changing whatever i'm completely desensitized amounts look wormwhole got patched like hour money people may see lives
323466,cobie talking ppl life talking meeting rent ppl phone sure needed waterfall coming space houses keep o2 pure plants
323467,shit can't say relate precisely way sure feel something similar sometimes
323468,builders ser think us spend days behind screen go like sunny said little talk spend 90% time something others dont want understand
323469,guys ignore kashibentobox discussing sushi nobody using kashi kashi actual infamous 13 users protocol instead synthetix
323473,check flipside crypto exactly looking
323474,dm'd
323476,wasabi
323478,anyone know best stable coin pool im heading away little remote work wanna cook stables
323484,think actually makes lot sense since organically includes collateral slippage computing position health suppose user makes 10m deposit lowliquidity coin borrows allow borrow 65m liquidators actually sell collateral 5m position protocol solvent paper directly take dy uniswap risk accounted
323485,
323486, um thats little pay grade
323487,inactive pair im mistaken
323488,headline apys also fees unlike ribbonyearn pretty dishonest tbh
323489,yeah dovs today risky proper dov design brings apy little market less correlation
323490,talking people crypto helps stay motivated large difference online text communication also irl cowork team members
323491,hmmmm ribbon marketing trick friktion
323492,website least claims take fees taken account
323493,show historical pnl hiding information
323494,feel hiding info lmk fixtry surface ui
323495,formula posted account fees account kinda weird include formula include fees tbh
323496,guess fees baked curr weeks performance
323497,current week performance account fees projected yield
323499,juliankoh maybe annualised mngmt fees performance fees included explicitly equation
323500,based julian
323501,hiding anything 
323503,projected yield yes also current week perf
323504,u clarify something sismo generated proofs constantly updating snapshot taken certain point time id assume former want clear
323507,nvm removed wrong link
323508,
323509,deensomally 
323510,even better find working node list use automatically

323527,
323528,finally rereading
323530,every discussion end taxes need respond memeing
323531,cant really argue said tbh feels like monet makes total sense somehow reality doesnt show things issue scenarios
323532, staking derivatives centralization blabla looks governance big difference whales exist everywhere
323533,funding rates approx 05%day
323534, short term incentives bribeswhere locked token holders increase net present value stake favoring short term focused payout increases either risky protocol changes accepting bribes expense long term value creation well longterm anyway far encourgaes daos communities pile vote works favour vecrv instead
323535,idk seeing concerns actually real
323536,order get holders lock need incentivize additional reward would concern start flywheel could never worked treasuries big lps daos pile sell work yes far far long time already
323537,criticism make sense u michwill
323538,
323539,well works holders incentivized revenues inflation
323540,much long time year
323541,great 15 years far
323542,long we'd consider financial markets even crypto history wiped successes ran longer model cool think need time really evaluate mainly need bad economic times markets easy money free
323543,wanna use foundry whats easiest way setup simple front end interact test contract
323544,guess download simple frontend hardhat right
323545,
323546,also check 
323547,today day stop playing aoe learn shit
323548,worth
323549,depending badly need actual frontend cast part foundry might enough
323550,basically allows interact contract abi command line
323551,id personally like see research around impact venomics could maker specifically rather conclude work works elsewhere 1 year already mkr last resort backstopping esm common elsewhere even generalizing venomics yet prove varied market conditions longer timeframes maker token dynamics arguably needed level scale show strengths
323552,say im would bad would great etcwhat know least go thru months research discussions something decided changed abruptly first time ppl suggest change system based latest trends
323553,right campaign
323554,ah ser sure maker ye needs tested adrianleb take months indeed referring fact curve context concerns didnt actually seem like manifested monet calling yet
323555,maybe yeah different systems different governance cultures mechanisms etc
323556,take monet simple
323557,represents view vcs less
323558,main objective vecrv create longterm alignment interests
323560,fact longterm vcs cannot commit
323561,typical 10year vc fund would
323562,need 1 week vesting dump plebs recent case ptp platypussay
323563,well clearly see funds 
323564,ofc
323565,irony gbmkr proposal originally posted vc
323566,lets make war vcs thing also answer many concerns expressed
323567,i'm experimental physicist unanswered concerns let's observe ongoing experiment find answer
323568,agree let's proceed observe current experimental model rather pivot another even experimental model seems work elsewhere
323569,respectful insightful discussion hasu yesterday another group vecrvvefxs tokenomics get conclude many topics bring one thing brought could food thought vetoken critics vetokens create pos dynamics dapp layer think underexplored advantage opinion one can't pro eth lido steth derivatives claim vetokens become captured tokenized convexlike protocols cvxcrvcvxfxs bad
323570,case hasu get finish discussion would love expand views soon time
323571,read back somewhere
323572,thats bc funding rate went longs shorts perpetual
323573,think private group unfortunately think easier either write views hasuothers wants discuss podcast probably easier conversational manner

324033,guess would come block size since end day isnt gives evm turing completeness blockchain huge blocsize 'computation' could included per block
324034,remove computation completely treat blockchain data layer think zkrollup depends time would take blocks reach majority getting aggregating signatures

324054,thanks tip
324055,pro tip youre experiencing could possibly beill forward dev team
324056,time matter user needing refresh page youll get harder cases help along way
324058,cb keep shameless stuff 
324059,successful dexs issued tokens taker fee rebates token distrobution done lps staking fixed amount tokens given period result overpaying liquidity anyone tried fee rebates taker refunded portion fees paid form token
324060,
324061,dov users we're research would love input 
324062,would incentivize lps stake tokens swapped
324067,fees paid traders use mixture lp incentives trading rebates im saying tokens would need distributed means fee rebate could use mixture two use governance balance guess thinking taker fee rebates would paid economic activity rather passive deployment capital may work cex would think issues maintaining proper pricing fee rebate type variable distrobution open attack vectors issuing tokens staking contract fixed rate
324068,well generally fees paid liquidity providers staked tokens dex reward parking tokens dex taker acts swap believed worthwhile additional incentive isnt needed per se play toward idea say rebate offered would necessarily small would increase cost gas transaction manage rebate added cost might high higher swap smart contract even l2 cheap l1 rebate value would likely tiny cost exchanging rebate token wouldnt likely worthwhile someone conducts many transactions low gas chain could possible rebate tokens aggregate value would still less anything liquidity providers receive swap fees probably going good model certainly sustainable one reasons
324069,yes almost cases takers pay volumes guess matter think important volume liquidity volume inflated fees paid remain constant % tx size lp funds sit someone needs
324070,web3 space probably took wrong turn point

324173,redacted bunch shit gm
324178,thats redacted retarded
324181,ok retarded ones stop typing go work read listen convo go cancel moms kisses x
324186,man someone exploited qi dao guys great builders working hard across multiple chains aave 
324187,much need tldr
324189,looks like 7 mil think team asleep maybe one aave guys wake pinged devs dm
324190,what's super matic familiar matic system third party
324191,superfluid's exploited
324192,20m mai think 
324193,track adress dumper 
324194,sure multiple accounts
324195,
324196,damnnnn
324198,look moca chart
324199,qi quite popular polygon right
324200,polygon
324201,didnt exact see bot alert
324202,usually bsc rugs
324203,superfluid got hacked
324204,looks like yes
324205,superfluid vesting contract
324206,ouch
324207,confirmed 
324208,buy dip situation
324209,sure hacker still 10m
324210,94m wallet looking exit liquidity id say
324211,since qi safe maybe apparently hackers holds
324212,could snapshot
324213,yeah yet
324214,think jump involved 
324215,holds 16% total supply fdv seem healthy
324216,can't really dump anymore i'd therefore expect snapahot new token
324217,qi based around maker vault system tho
324218,would migrate collateral new token
324219,multiple chain lot different protocols doubt would snapshot sold already maybe he's got 3% supply left
324220,
324221,seen repos posts e2e testing crosschain interactions hardhat seems like would need fork multiple networks time
324222,collateral fine problem governance token
324223,hacked team guess investors vesting
324224,founder data indexing project completely agree pay huge infrastructure fees quite difficult directly access node's data real time needs processing make granular hence keep data centralized dbs increases cost well makes centralized try decentralize people host centralized dbs validation top cost increases significantly said asking dapp develop indexers much ask takes quite bit learning curver understand internals blockchain implement proper indexer army maintain especially indexing chain like bsc solana kudos graph took subgraph approach necessity data even people smart contract developers that's balancers transactions etc help also subgraph requires people write code even trivial requirements unmarshal currently testing code auto indexing tool smart contracts built support price token details notifications analytics apis hopefully solves many issues discussed 
324225,oh whoops got confused ty
324226,really team investor tokens get interesting watch who's taking loss end
324227,maybe create another gov token distribute depending holders prev hack
324228,hacker dumped qi mabe time apeing
324229,yup
324230,deposit assets maifinance risk 
324231,
324232,hack superfluid qi mai
324233,hack specific vesting contracts possibility others also compromised
324234,superfluid hack streams compromised
324235,
324236,large oof
324237,see 
324238,holy shit ok thats big 
324239,ambulance chased qi great team they'll build back
324241,im
324242,bro
324243,appears team's owned vested tokens stolen users that's twist
324244,user token superfluid
324245,think someone said team early investors assume long term vesting
324246,got weird early stage investors get affected
324247,circulating supply 61mm qi accurate anymore
324248,unless deposited hand
324249,think early investors probably got rekt
324250,prob vesting
324251,
324252,mean he's wrong effectively vs lofty claims manage hit upper end would ideal conditions tad impressive
324253,maybe conditions ideal per team also document tests see 50 50 lower bound tbh hot stuff get 150 intrashard concensus
324254,per team sure realize claims count much anything spend time getting next audit done hoping result favorable making claims
324262,see polygon hacker address stopped performing tx blacklist polygon possible
324263,wait
324264,
324265,say anything
324266,etherscan gives warnings suspected exploit addys well
324267,oh yes saw suspended suspected guess fully woke yet anyway address stopped performing transactions
324268,mean can't transactions blocked polygon transactions might eating went outside groceries
324270,sure large validator set would trivial block transactions account
324271,lot harder impossible ethereum
324272,might want edit mean could make validators update nodes blacklist address making accept txs account i'm sure doable short notice that's horrible idea imo
324273,wow lol sounds painful would probably cheaper polygon cover hacked funds trashing whole network stop 10m spent could literally worse solution imaginable
324274,polygon nothing qi bribes starting market eventually bid price exploits happen every daay b strengthening overall ecosystem
324275,polygon problem would set dangerous precendent ship buggy code massive generalisation know likely extremely complex edge case etc etc offload responsibility someone else make good
324276,problem core chain absolutely step
324279,they've done though multiple multimillion exploits bailout full ctrlz
324280,well exist recent wormhole bailout saying would first time something like happens space saying point things seen precedents either way since individual decisions mainly occur much stake big parties
324281,hi guys please send guide create farm dex 
324282,u went searching platform sell shitcoin needing pool 2
324283,asking guide probably build
324284,lol toxic guys
324285,toxic shitty dev handling others peoples money code
324286,goal audit favorable audits need public public per request team goal test performance claims rather security lets jump question protocols took external audit moreover protocols public stress test show claimed performance meets promises far i'm aware none done form open security audit reached congestion tps much lower publicly talked yeah lets ignore lol
324287,little blunt largely correct please spend time considering might feel something goes terribly wrong smart contract development everyone start securethorg fork mainnet play around instead
324288,jump trading plugging eth hole nothing w hard fork blockchain
324292,hardfork bailout absolutely different things 
324297,convo weird lets end pointless
324298,never said favorable many words based misunderstanding ganbare public per request team stop telling stories ser even chat jepsen always make reports public radix know start
324299,aaaand end next time monthly mutes take radix stuff away love
324300,legit enough enough 7th time asking take away
324301,efficient solution follow value change smart contract method doesnt trigger event

324632,gnosisdao 7% circulating supply liquid ownership stake gnosisdao surpasses 7% must distribute selling issuing gno holders means good reason sell
324633,lmao fantastic gymnastics haha
324634,mean great product builders amazing ethos cant really say anything bad even print token product koeppelmann say prefer multi token future would met positively everyone wins right
324635,clown sitting stables
324636,dont read much news coming russia
324637,anywhere matter 
324645,imo basic distribution scheme ofc partially benefiting current holders dont see anything really quick cash grab per se also see need make safe token integral utility part like gnosis spinoffs lead better positioning products well fulltime teamscommunities focused specific areas example safe dao gov infrastructure integrations bd value capturesplits safe stakeholders
324646,dont see particular case
324647,title misleading actual news russian people declare big btc transactions go jail like foreign currencies
324648,correct though want give crypto formal currency designation
324649,would open whole worms national security standpoint designation step right direction imo
324650,well central bank want ban crypto lose control money printer
324651,rest govt stepped said wanted get taxes instead got putin board
324652,also fact friends secret police spookocracy like half shady crypto exchanges
324653,big mean 02 btc
324654,fsb
324655,give much credence news either memory kind talk going since 2017 russia results also assume kremlin towers love initiative agee vorot93 little accurate information far information passes looks like attempt gauge society reaction imo thus suggest waiting actions precedents first
324656,talked lawyers i'm still paying taxes crypto sales russia decision yet law regulation digital assets includes cryptocurrencies drafted details yet done yet operational central bank tries push toward complete ban ministry finance tries regulate take control crypto without banning neither side yet
324657,would pretty hard putin go back without losing face
324658,tokenomics defined point main reason token establish gnosis safe fully communityowned infrastructure token holders decide pure governance eg onchain assets project utility token im sure also discussion around token mechanisms foster ecosystem growth example safedao could decide makes sense establish new l1 gnosis safe firstclass account safe token staking token network dont think would make sense illustrate idea
324659,since chimed ministry finance's side
324660,yeah supposedly ministry win knows russia
324661,also someone wants go legal pay taxes crypto converted fiat russia lmk legal team managed make happen several people including bit complicated dangerous might look
324662,house cards russia house cards country world peculiar elite configuration aside think russia saying holds tbh
324663,yes
324664,could elaborate risk past simply declared income crypto operations screenshots attached declaration passed check
324665,well legally can't sell crypto random people without reason documents provided tax authority easily send request requiring proof transactions made sales agreements counter parties many problems declaring i'm sure right place sort conversation
324666,got hope one 2021 passes well thank insight
324668,main contribution lobsterdao today gif
324669,yeah many guns wall russia actually shoot country diligent correctly declaring income paying taxes money try use rest world effort takes everything legally good luck 2021 
324670,damn bite
324671,ivan ending convo
324672,lets discuss lobster nft special place love gif btw

324685,explains 
324686,hi guys i'm bit confused safe transfer rule erc1155 case user sends nft wrong address user b transfer call revert docs mentioned transfer call must revert error occurs case considered error mentioned
324687,ah ok performance art makes sense
324688,think user's fault system's fault
324689,scenarios included error 
324690,thank looks exactly like looking i'm familiar compiling code need run createdistsh

324720,
324721,
324722,
324725,yeah
324726,retire mr duck
324727,anyone farming fantombank apy stable pool insane
324728,recently tvl went 40m 200m i'm little bit concerned
324729,bro shits 247 stress
324730,
324731,thats without mev
324732,better take break terms forced burnout etc
324733,feel i'm attacked 
324734,anyone arweave usage understand value permanent censorship resistant data storage thing beyond way look requires miners actually store blocks ensure data storage permanent via incentivizing endowments paid via ar tokens doesnt seem like permanent trying think beyond storage uses focus data retrieval services 5000 tps pretty low comparing youtube data usage 1b hours per day 200m gb data usage per day arweave didnt even come close 1tb per day thats mostly data storage purposes
324739,storage chains generally unsustainable long term
324740,farming projects ftm make sense
324741, ribbon going implement vetokenomics
324742,unsustainable aspect enough rewards miners continue adoption rate permanent isnt needed
324743,oh well guess convex getting even share things
324744,yearn
324745,arweave's succinct proofs random access spora consensus mechanism incentivises miners prove random access data miner competitive store data less replicated parts weave one use case besides nft's smartcontract frontends 10 blockchains partnered kyve archive transactionhistory arweave clientside smartcontracts possible arweave redstone provides commonly adopted standard sdk theres explorer read contracts see interactions 70% data stored bundled using bundlr users pay using eth sol matic etc get near instant data access i'm sure 5000 tps readfigure comes need faster reads i'd imagine want cdn edge compute think comparison youtube relevant youtube trying permanently store data better measure growth limits see whether appropriate application mind
324746,banteg considering 1week enterexit periods ribbon well able exit time still possible integrate ribbon juliankoh asking integration perspective also dm
324747,yeah enterexit delays make much harder build farming strategies top ribbon
324748,btw anyone convex
324749,btw neuron launch venomics revenue sharing votes rewarding streams weights
324750,5000 tps read lightpaper 44 data storage useful data retrieval data retrieval would also incur txn cost right idea wider adoption unable scale large applicational use youtube kind social media it'll miners mining rewards chains storing small amount data relative global scale
324751,c2tpeth
324752,
324753,people would stick cheaper even free alternatives like ipfs pay 20x data storage even permanent average joe care less permanent unless wish content controlled taken 3rd parties oppressive censorship agenda
324754,
324755,interesting
324756,yes
324758,enough space collectively grow infinity cost math check also soon another solution appears storage chain basically entering spiral death kind like malls opening next another mall offering free rent tenants move old mall dies lack use thing happens new one one etc
324759,arweave's lightpaper 2018 maintained regards youtube scale web3 priorities different web2 counterparts applies web3 whole ser lack education wrt nft media assets reliant 3rd party pay storage unfortunately problem protocol hacks caused frontends compromised ipfs speciality matching filehash content different mutuallycompatible technologies costs cents store 10mb permanently btw
324761,anything done
324762,interesting analogy apply protocols either since incentives
324763,pays proto
324764,metaplex uses arweave storage services nft hot thing right might correlation services right taking nft away arweave that's crypto specific would lose even uses since ipfs literally use non crypto purposes low cost easy use compared arweave
324765,trying rise beyond noob understanding appreciate patience discussing
324766,comparing impermanent permanent storage yes clear correlation nft launches metaplex arweave usage
324767,max u founder
324768,yep
324769,yup begs question would average joe really concern permanent storage heshe would pay 20x price
324770,nice u going lo launch project
324771,need alpha
324772,launch option pools token 2022 q2
324773,nft storage average joe pays zero person launching nft generally want money wager majority project parties gone paying storage 10 years education problem imo sure comparing ease use arweave storage option built metaplex websites let drag drop files free ar faucets simple crypto products still requires browserextension downloaded 
324774,necessarily least completely imo protocol versatile enough uses pivot specialize depends community storage chains one usp hurr durr cheap storage forever lie unlike free transactions forever see aurora clowns
324775,aurora never claimed free forever subsidizing gas costs always temporary mechanism attract users arweave claim cheap comparitively looking store data 5 years competitive check fee calculator see whether useful rather armchair musings enjoy buddhist philosophy day born old enough die nothing guaranteed permanent asteroid crash earth point using cryptoeconomic incentives aims sustain network way users invested crypto exchanges obv incentivised operate full archival nodes personally archive prized nft's
324776,dunno none things make long term sense default ipfs protocol can't die easily storage chain would rather bayc whatever hands stored decentralized way hope arweave go advanced prtocols like rmrk use multiresources several fallbacks single nft's media file cake eat relying one thing temporary mathenomics around long time kinda crazy imo
324777,protocol storage weave anyone run node decentralised easily one many sources suggest anyway convo goes circles done
324778, live
324779,liquidity
324780,admins quiet radial discord something cooking
324781,
324782,anyone knows there's way send arbitrum transactions directly contract ie similar etherscan's contract functionality arbiscan support yet apparently
324783,sorry ask something answered 100 times almost impossible ctrlf channels tgtwitterdiscord post fundraises know one 
324784,
324785,
324786,arweave totally sustainable
324787,optimised vast quantities data fact block limit data data stored ever 
324788,hi mates hosting dev event ethdenver devcon golden ticket hackathon monday 14th top 3 buidlers coming us colombia attend devcon 6 welcome everyone 
324789,model based inflation rewards think work long term
324790,terms improving writing arweave im founder bundlr network working improve arweaves write read speed quite easily optimise real time applications already
324791,inflationary storage costs
324792,remember correctly economic model users pay system gives inflation rewards miners correct
324793,anyone know bypass price impact high block dex's
324794,well mixture rewards given winning block relative network difficulty strongly incentivised store entire weave data
324795,right means sense users paying resource they'll consume forever correct understand there's strong assumption storage become cheaper time still sounds economically unsustainable income one costs recurring perpetuity
324796,remember exact figures real storage deflation cost 2030% per year arweave assumes 13% maybe less verify
324797,build strong incentives hold rare data
324798,data rare data hold make
324799,refer users think user base rather limited since many people would willing pay high price permanent storage idea permanent storage dont go beyond lifespan
324800,fundamental structure crypto networks fact i'd argue stronger networks 
324801, appreciate kind words pleasure battle however still far early quit glanced github eoa nice bot matter much cut latency able beat better capitalized trade larger sizes thus afford pay higher gas prices learn make money become faster matter long takes wait strongest form day must hone abilities seek surpass
324802,man legend reply author 
324803,oh cool big depositor ser anyway building integration convex ofc since gib lp tokens back like yearn would require us gearbox build intermediary contract inbetween give said lp tokens example cause like imagine got liquidated claim rewards 1 month ok accounted liquidations cause cant taken apart rewards ok oracles place needed different coins cvxcrvstkaavesnxwhatever account claim gas costs basically trivial could ask dev questions chat maybe
324804,absolutely glad see dev questions discussions chat
324805,spam yes activity launch yet either rug rn whats issue dont tag andre small bullshit things got dmed link reply

324837,nothing wrong withdrawing weth liquidity pool go everyone decides exit that's different markets uniswap
324838,whats suspicious
324839,someone sent thought relevant us shared see ppl thought matter 15 followers data accurate
324840,ah looksrare public info massive influencer driven cash grab
324841,cash grab 
324843,fantastic platform overvalued
324844,nft buyer opensea pretty much earned looks airdrop back weth staking free monies care platform pretty cool though like 
324845,imagine team investors cashing 60m usd one month project launch
324846,complaining revenue share percentage fees generated eth
324847,idc tbh web3 folks scoff teams raising vc funds ok fair launches like
324848,yeah theopendao thing maintream twitter influencers borolman tweet thread guys referring accurate factually speaking without subjective opinions
324849,saying anything
324850,whats argument
324851,argument essentially early seed investors earned shitton eth vested tokens due washtrading eventually unload bags well social momentum looksrare obviously also driven seed investors many big ct influencers nothing special things go whether looksrare actually proves viable product first determined seed investors exited ponzinomics cooled reason hate calling money grab yet
324852,really complaining wanted see ppl thought made decent chunk money trading looks
324853,ye fair play nobody dumped tokens people wash trade strategy get rewards nobody said fair launch either ita really sensible argument shit aggressive working strategy
324854,staked since day 1 made half initial back essentially cashed profit letting rest ride sohnds like people salty got late
324855,yes might overvalued right goes lower buying nobrainer
324857,adjust timeframes 6 12 months weeks
324858,sorry assumed everyone reading tweet threas argument following 2 strategies strategy 1 launch shitcoin fork market heavily influencers dump pool2 using unlocked tokens strategy 2 launch shitcoin fork claim teaminvestor tokens locked use influencers promote wash trading farm tokens let teaminvestors take cut fees strat 1 abhorrent strat 2 commentors establishing equivalence
324859,far looksrare attracted lot business opensea put pressure opensea improve win win imo realworld quite common large companies use predatory tactics steal business shops eg lossmaking coffee shop supermaket aim putting competitors business case looks like team investors likely earned monies back far better strategy mention would cause concern team intention continue project
324860,people pissed opensea stole money
324861,halvening could see typical vicious cycle since theres half rewards looks price tanking wash trading volume dries half raw eth apr earned stakers drops half makes less attractive hold stake leads selling lower price goes less wash trading done earn looks
324862,sell buy dip really dont see issue
324863,people get obsessed moralising ideological issues forget make money
324864,yup good project nft youre buying price brainer buy actually get something vs getting anything paying platform fees opensea
324865,yea looks like tried hard hide fees teaminvestors making like guy thread said totally cool project revenue instead simpler way devised roundabout way sketchy
324866,sketchy ffs revenue share system revenue totally different currency one hiding anything
324867,ok
324868,less sketchy straight hardcoding rev stream whitelisted address like projects
324869,passive staking weth seedlocked tokens known advance far know
324870,10x eth seed investors month well played thanks airdrop looks team anyway question heard team fired cz exbunny core devs making hostages seed investors threatens take away allocation something bad would spoken public field looksrare
324871,source definitely malicious
324872,def heard exbinance sure threats
324873,cant fork ui either
324874,fork since os closed source suited reptile organization
324875,equivalent shop exchanges foreign currency pays staff shareholders dollars see problem 
324876,frankly looks team hidden seed stakers get tokens
324877,cant call bad hustle
324878,market participants dd
324879,attest done absolutely 0 useless investor never asked anything support showed personal bias tested platform put lobbies set royalties tried floor bid option worked well
324880,rofl
324881,never heard whats source
324882,dont get saft
324883,exactly learned smart way
324884,think fact revenuesharing marketplace thats questionable rather whats sold retail ultimate buyers looks providing exit liquidity wash traders keep system alive product make sense opensea token revenue sharing would make obvious security
324886,lmao
324887,yeah assumed early investors team tokens staked getting share eth secondaries way everybody else need money growbuild etc actually makes sense sustainable imo theyre incentivized hold tokens drivesustain trading volume platform rather dump tokens retail future price pumpunlock
324888,public info lol
324889,marketed differently
324890,normies would buy picture dog usecase
324891,additional treasury 30m team already cashed individual wallets totaling 30m
324892,pool2's hated also info public stop us criticizing cash grabs know fundamental flaws whats marketed
324893,fair
324894,many investors see withdrawals ethersscan
324895,hard see long term prospects team makes much money early
324896,team giga rich start peanuts
324897,accusations seem place idk
324898,good
324899,yeah that's subjective argument many rich teams continue work hard
324900,there's actually convex deposit token get back interest bearing thus stake start getting rewards staking part wrapped fit want integrate side examples fact abracadabra uses wrappers create erc20 position directs rewards directly users feel free get touch go deeper may miss things chat
324901,yes cvx3crv abra wonder easy liquidate
324902,awesome thank dmed
324903,far os killers go gem good chance imo
324904,token purchases exit liquidity token purchases doesnt accruesustain value yes looks seems like obvious security thats medium long term risk platform creators short term risk buyers mean thats whole lotta contracts ui build docs write etc exit scam something thats actually viable competitor product
324905,arguably dydx incentivised washtrading launching token
324906,team profited actually
324907,looks stakers also happened backers
324908,market makers think
324909,anyone free market maker heck washtrading manually lol
324910,yeah said 'only team'
324912,marketmakers got valueless dydx tokens later year remove ability company profit protocol
324913,dydx actually decentralize trading engines sure otherwise dydx token useless much exit liquidity vcs decentralized opensea right
324915,think uniswapdydx tokens taken fair share criticisms atleast clear uniswap run decentralized way decentralized opensea uber obvious
324916,dont think completely decentralized os possible current crypto infra
324917,yeah definitely exit scam means team demo even starting raising asking feedbackbeta testing exchange perfect yet ofc neither opensea theyve quick ship even pushing opensea aggro ye tokenomics aggro get marketshare imo
324918,thank jason
324919,yeah despite wash trading illegal afaik real problem used fake volume value underlying asset looks using customer acquisition strategy doesnt nefarious activity somebody wash trading nft art offload valueless piece unsuspecting collector sees good price history
324920,projects witnessed amount washtradingmercenary farming one's hate similar hate would get launched decentralized uberairbnb today say hey launched token first mover aggressive gain market share darren's line reasoning
324921,yeah looks case wash trading really people buying selling nothing nefarious imo assume people also check exchanges see true floor price assets esp since discrepancies huge lot data analytics platforms show guts also super responsive whenever spam w opensealooks complaints like daily lmfao
324922,yeah wash trading book farming wash trading intentional deception tactic fluff market volume looks rare transmining incentives leading farming different thing imo
324923,data analytics platforms recommend seeing
324924,liquidity mining farming
324925,
324926,think difference looks actually launched product works unique features comparing pitch deck actual product isnt accurate
324927,exactly phrasing farming actually makes distinction clear well put
324928,2017 decentralized airbnb project fully functional website could list houses stuff
324929,easy fork opensea termed looks one actually launched something like despite nft tear 2021
324930,putting words mouth didnt say easy build opensea
324931,said regularly ridicule projects launch tokens products dont need token looks worthy ridicule eg 
324932,binance led worlds richest crypto billionaire taking 200 million stake forbes cnbc
324933, assuming talking looks
324934,farming generalised term playing value extraction game protocol farming tokens liquidity mining game farming tokens trading farming play earn game similar
324935,crux argument absurdity product marketed easy fork
324936,lol ccr 2019 back product need token
324937,see argument everything future tokenized comes securities utility tokens understand today purely decentralized see decentralized opensea built totally different ground architecture
324938,think take away investor looks dont virtue signal vcs bad lol incentives align humans behave
324939,whats connection
324940,ye idk whats false narrative never spread 
324941,ok lets end weird yet bashing anon accs done
324942,
324943,yessir

325022,
325023,
325024,assembly file split chunks inside one two assembly blocks first 2 last 3 chunks could grouped together doesnt help readability much maybe optimization 
325025,lets continue nftavenue please forward message agree would much like honorary nft relatable anyone person
325026,fyi live

325030,brief filed gov't regarding detention finex launderers
325031,seems like pinnacle
325032,solidly encrypted yet decrypted less year
325033,maybe even less mention 2021 year access cloud storage without specifying date
325034,thanks ivangbi posted question nftavenue
325035,please
325036,
325037,sure dm pls
325038,please 
325039,mean actually broke encryption could gotten hands key parts surveillance evidence
325040,heya saw topic uploading white list lets say 4k entries cost eth using lagrange multiplier order create polynom need see address solution polynom
325041,think usually people via merkletree days
325042,guess right
325043,idea sounds interesting work paper
325044,wouldnt create unique polynomial per address
325045,addresses points solution polynom lets simplify xx0xx1 gives x2 poly x0 x1 solution know better merkle 
325046,yep pure math create function goes solutions address solution
325047,sure used right term one needed search later
325048,btw function might heavy well save unless g field maybe mathematician
325049,intensive would find solution takes k adresses seems intensive
325050,would practically interesting takes less gas calculate whether address valid merkel approach collisions could concern well
325051,ye right need benchmarks validation creation one time chain course believe tested well
325052,cant get point uploading n coefficients polynom instead n solutions
325053,yep also thought later
325058,
325059,
325060,hacked lol
325061,clue nobody seems idea never figure solscan stuff
325062,maybe solcasino crap
325063,airdropped 100 worth thousands addys
325064,claim login site sign message
325066,bro rumors coming lol
325067,weth withdrawal statement tweetstorm yesterday
325068,salty salty looks fudders started pop soon looks staking rewards halved
325069,mean whats wrong withdrawing 10billimonth
325070,freemarkets free markets burning third party money
325071,wrong people using fees rewards whatever want 
325072,
325073,there's still vesting period right
325074,yes year remember correctly
325076,please lobsterdao
325077,well see guess much bribes solidly attract protocol good earning 0xdao especially guess solidex got lot good partners radial seems behind race eh reptiles gonna watch
325078,looks like already tradingquite expensive atm wanna load lping though
325079,anything 0 fine long rug effort fine guess 
325080,true circ supply probably less 1% atm buying lp's make super high risk getting rekt
325081,solana turning cream blockchains 
325082,sure hack
325083, anybody know
325084,finally attestation random intervals opposed predetermined times approved 3rd parties
325090,weird nosource info redacted weird shit back something 
325092,eth merge community call happening right bored 
325096,seed round something
325097,
325099,fozzysbo scroll convo nothing hidden annoyed hey guys rumour tdevs get paid 100k month cannot confirm would deleted regardless project address source spam put muh conspiracy back came kind ser
325100,conspiracy lol stating set locked tokens could receive eth trading rewards cashing
325101,well yes thats clear af discussed convo 
325102,deleted msgs regard weird nosourced bs rumour
325103,
325104,
325110,absolutely bonkers imagine waking one morning scanning github repo finding critical likely bug reporting retiring immunefi's bounty board essentially become advertising leaderboard point dick swinging protocol security
325112,well bug like established protocol likely weeksmonths pentesting find something promising quite days make proof concept ensure works write need absolute fucking expert solidity type person who'd land 400k jobs easily
325113,joined vulnerability rewards program google back day made less minimum wage teen little experience def easy that's simply testing img srcx onerroralert1 many fields find defi need actually know smart contracts work even start
325114,otoh sup idea 
325115,survivorship bias one theres 1000 failed applies almost anything life tbh
325116,side operating bug bounty prgram like standing front sewer pipe full blast trying find diamonds imperfect system 10m sure sells dream motivates
325117,we've come far 
325118,know reason called bug actual bugs used come sit sheets used imprint code person running compiler actually huge physical machine go clear sheets physical bugs
325119,official lobster dao collaboration incentives testing gear

325122,
325123,could possibly
325124,curious u want get data structures algo 
325125,
325126,yes question
325127,wdym topic i'm good i've read academic beyond understanding
325128,nice quite unusual people crypto asking ds algo although imp skills development 
325129,think try leet code pick category example linked list read problem go back book google try solve problem best way excel hand
325133,think correct take web programs problem massive population web bug hunters looking make quick buck blockchain security almost strictly high skill less issue immunefi provide filtering minimize noise signal generally signal noise ratio lot higher mitigated effective program creation understand another type business transaction treated way dynamic changes tonne
325134,parties already touch let's see plays
325135,maybe poor metaphor end must receive 1000x many bogus messages compared real ones say many people browsing immunefi view business transaction i'd expect solid core professionals must severely outnumbered people flinging whatever find try get paid people take seriously dont wait nevermind understand meaning noise signal ignore smoothbrain
325136,confirm immunefi triage provides high signal reports happy customers
325139,black hats knowing option making dumb decisions option rivals bad bounties work people actively looking stuff claim
325140,
325141,
325142,
325143,blockfi pay 100 million fines sec link
325147,looks like frax fpi snapshot date confirmed
325148,anybody confirm 'theblock research' service available individuals
325151,hi one knows happened inj
325152,injective protocol mean
325153,think final unlock happened
325154,fyi cowswap airdrop claimable rush got 6 weeks claim token transferable kinda like gearbox article 
325155,jsut realised tax benefits non transferrable tokens
325156,pretty nifty
325157,url claim cant find
325158,normal website button top right corner kinda uniswap style 
325160,found mobile
325161,
325162,non eth stuff 0 tvl yet apys almost point going away eth sheet least
325163,
325164,didnt read yet ofc
325165,protocol change begin addition internal bonds similar external bonds know today user trades quote token protocol return amount ohm future internal bonds differ external bonds quote token token given protocol ohm rather external asset ie dai eth etc 1 ohm deposited depositor given note giving claim x ohm date x assumed greater 1 far understand basically introducing bonds extracting ohm market give u ohm later interest alternative insane apy reduced switch focus apy bonds sales
325166,pretty complicated way implementing staking rewards depend time lock tokens
325167,could potentially one thinking option
325168,bros anyone enlighten bancor offer huge base apr stable coins addition token rewards stats
325170,youre depositing usdc youre providing liquidity usdcbnt pair
325171,yes get check stats volume thus fees low
325172,saturday sharing 
325173,impermanent loss works curve pools notcorrelated assets like tricrypto v2 pools
325174,better v2 curve curve looks like compared standard xyk uniswap curve
325175,dear sers could anyone please recomment bridge polular evmlike chain tron usdt turned usecase like get visa bali trc20 usdt crypto option seem like anyswap lifinance others dont support something got google search indistinguishable finsihingscam since never work tron ecosystem 
325176,indonesia accept crypto payment visas
325177,look like there's decentralised option say use poloniex binance
325178,spoiler alert bridges decentralized
325179,bridge tron bttc also bttc ethbsc
325180,seriously guy getting scammed can't get visa bali crypto
325181,know bali visa thought bali island indonesia
325182,concern well russian citizen pain butt get us visa visit ethdevers etc possible solution get indenesia apply get need visa well agency claims asistance havent worked theres possibility scammers offer exachange trx20usdt indonesian rupies pay legal fees presumingly thats way swap crypto assume dont know way

325188,youre giving single side il covered 90 days
325189,didnt know thanks sounds good
325190,trick gas fee high basically whales
325191,
325192,think nthe vulnerability
325194,theres much liquidity enough bnt provide stables singlesided try provide singlesided usdc dai let
325195,little liquidity fee revenue per dollar invested pool high
325197,bnt needs provided open space work
325198,single sided liquidity works bancor allocating bnt pair token
325199,currently doesnt enough pool
325200,ren tron tho
325201,also searched time ago due usdt trc20 popular crypto atms ended giving using kucoin least kyc free
325202,ren delay decentralization
325203,happy hear
325204,maxroszko
325205,meant darknodestech sense per dao last time looked voting treasury stuff idk stand tbh still consider true decentralized reliable tech interchain already existing chains seen varen
325206,think greycore still testnet governance stuff another thing
325207,thanks
325208,sup
325209,long wait time call high retainer prefer michael rosmer offshore citizen get call days wealthy expat decent well free chat familiar dubai
325210,that's
325211,yes whats
325212,best bet relocation finding local expat group facebookwhatsappetc asking lawyergestor youll usually get recommended firm nomad capitalist others recommend without hefty commission priced
325213,damn bruh dope guy mentioning
325214,tech basically ready deployed slow pace give time lot testing bug fixing hardening etc
325217,use anycashbot centralised custody obv know founders use many many years
325221,muh first decentralized bridge
325222,max loong holding secret keys
325223,anyone
325224,uses curve uni v2
325225,set date looks like issues fixed expecting sometime next week
325227,
325228,tri pools like 3 asset balancer pool 
325229,constast invariant like uni thenjust 3 assets
325230,thought used something different
325231,read whitepaper info iirc high level spreading liquidity thicker around internal moving average oracle price
325232, think exact though
325233,anybody know organiser one sponsors told appalling behaviour
325234,give context planning attending
325235,1
325236,impermanent loss lot greater balanceruni
325237,know oracle
325238,yes 
325240,know organisers years great ppl
325241,dvpn providers looked orchid sentinel mysterium deeper default onehop connection february 2022 
325242,really fees dynamic rebalancing costs function speed market moves gas prices pool size
325243,oracle internal uses 10 minute ema iirc
325244,make kind lotteryrandom ones chance win rare ones might collectibletrading value think pokmon
325245,let check comfortable sharing showed pretty bad
325246,hey sure told accused things i've never said got mad defended

325248,answered mentioned
325249,appreciate
325250,theverge netflix orders docuseries crypto laundering couple
325251,hmm know stepn there's also genopets like idea incentivising good habits explored concept much know various apps exist web2 space encourage exercise habits usually centered around accountable group others
325253,messages
325256,crypto false accusation messages private
325259,yes reaction heh
325265,might interesting exercise generate credits used buy customise nft eg take look aavegotchi lets buy sorts 'wearables' via erc998 composable nft spec maybe w limited timespecific garments sale
325266,denied esta
325267,ask mentioned visa want visa want visa waiver
325268,russians
325269,bad thought system universal sorry misinfo
325271,hey geniuses lets say want contract1 chain send tokens contract2 chain b also want pass associated data contract2 knows tokens b evm chains ecosystem cant take advantage subnetsparachainsibc type magic whats simplest standard way send data im new web3 dev forgive theres obvious approach im seeing
325274,nice meet lobsters
325275,afaik straightforward solution yet movr building smth similar
325283,layer zero
325284,gpact
325285,generalized messaging protocols interchain exchange

325290,andrecronje ib hasnt long time dont associate
325291,felt need clarify given weird creamassociated token moves
325292,weird needed new team allocation
325293,would guess fixed forex knows multi chain also 2 words lotta possibilities
325294,
325295,wait get many users
325296,airdrop hunters
325297,need use intermessaging system based bridge like celer network im tonbridge
325298,give zero collateral loans trustless environment call partner friend
325299,also would explain last minute airdrop cancellation ib team yet justified cream discord ded twitter ded
325300,quick update context arranged call organisers sponsors figure seems massive miscomunication good ppl hope things get fixed shortly
325303,heard conference drama sides yeah would much like resolved greed really ruin people
325304,lobsterdao nft mad floor price getting one get discount event 
325305,top 40 crypto vc investment funds demonstrated results
325306,there's way accurate lol
325307,alameda negative yield ok
325308,measured july 2020 dec 2021 believe
325309,factor secret discounts
325310,secret discounts seedprivate factor
325311,price time announcement
325312,
325313,garbo usually nobody knows exits funds raised follow rounds etc etc never pay attention stats
325314,absolutely right funds usually exiting via market makers strict nda
325315,could take months exit
325316,built alpha indicator fund announces invested token bullish buy bearish
325317,rate actual investment result guys yes said know actual entry actual exit
325318,doesnt serve unless retail kol type muh fund focused dumping early making money early thats thing say really anything midterm would signal
325319,list top 40 vcs benefit new projects would start
325320,people still share old vc tier sheet mess
325321,digit dao shilling andrecronje name pd would better andre clarify people get rekt
325322,would say projects need think want instead looking vc lists environment least
325323,literally clue talking also 10 projects per week claiming kind involvement i've learned tweeting lack involvement normally gives even publicity say nothing medium twitter i'm involved
325325,someone eth boba network need comission bridge send u x2 busd first
325327,hm yield calculated exactly
325328,
325329,pretty interesting wow
325330,btw unknown weird fake dao account probably ignore anyway
325331,report bad even included projects dont tokens yet lol
325332,oh report lol
325333,excel tables substack count report yup haha
325334,reported thanks
325335,
325336,
325337, allow passing data chains lz approach appears easier devs centralized last time checked testnet nomad chad tech great team chat believe
325338,known either edgy rumours absolute bs nothing inbetween really wanna laugh numbers lasseclausen 
325339,apparently u r losing money
325340,wu blockchain never credible source yellow paper circus sorry wouldnt saying didnt try show bs data research
325341,wow read
325342,read utter nonsense insane methodology even call
325343,greycore pretty decentralized yeah stepping stone final version everyone running nodes ren participate key generation management
325347,shows token performance raise announcement vcs profit gonna much higher maxprofit
325348,hey much metamask dependent infura
325349,like infura infra suffers outage metamask unavailable users
325351,yes
325354,lifinance connext nomad implemented whereby connext allows additional contract calls destination chain nomad send messages nomad atm restricted 3 chains theyll add big 6 within next 34 weeks feel free dm

325366,anyone know shib back planned big devs whales maybe anyone found info
325367, slightly outdated
325368,thank
325369,info made proven false long ago waste time read
325370,yea
325371,metamask entirely dependent infura well etherscan
325372,uses etherscan verify responses whatever rpc connected mainnet
325373,ohm proposing fixed period staking cant quite understand lot complex wording
325374,yeah think fixed maturity bonds i'm still unclear intended replace current inflationary staking
325375,mention tokenized bonds therefore trade like actual erc20s market par premium discount value plus interest
325376,yeah numbers dog shit
325377,anyone list crypto options protocols currently running lyra premia dopex ones heard
325378,ribbon finance another
325379,
325381,ribbon options buy sell though right seems like automated strategy uses options generate yield thinking rbn reminds guess also opyn seem accessible since l1 currently
325382,yeah kinda like jonesdao
325383,imo dopex probs best really like arb
325385,unrelated anyone knows one watch superbowl online
325387,dopex best tried looking thing even really seem allow sellbuy puts lol imo makes worthless terms options platform
325388,theyre releasing puts soon
325389,pods finance eth polygon arbitrum
325390,best place place bet using crypto
325395,thanks responses checking next day
325396,crazy iv movements recently huh
325398,rdl zombie project
325401,sonicblend yes saw stepn genopets interesting
325402,think lyra one best options protocols good quality team ux comparitavely great
325410,bit difficult understand value web3 idea
325411,aave polygon problems matic
325412,meta
325413,that's libra
325414,hes probably turkish lira
325415,reiterate yields represent vc investment performance measure reference significance financing information investors investors use financing background one criteria judging merits project suitable followon investment know true cost price exit price vcs calculates yield current priceprice date publication max profit highest price since publicationprice date publication max loss lowest price since publicationprice date publication since release financing information
325416,useless thx confirming
325417,dont think thats claim
325418,think saying involvement big vcs seed doesnt mean profitable retail public market vcs future rounds already know numbers justify guess
325419,basically standard media files distributed network serve files consider implications wp somewhere
325420,guys saw haw thomasgeth arrow founder almost got scammed
325421,yes
325422,pretty high effort really see thread 
325423,focus intricacy scam rather realising doxxing eth address well adding real name complete clown show
325424,indeed actual attack vector asking token approval genius iq attack
325426,process led unconventional one maybe
325427,well technically complicated backstory social engineering part seems pretty advanced tho
325428,
325429,yes saw wp really impressed also technicalnot easy understand expertanyway looks solid project imao
325431,wrt arrowthomasg attack someone else also receiving emails random gmail accounts say ethopian airlines booking confirmed victoria's secret payment done emails receiving direct attachment dont hit spam filters link eventually redirects legit innocuous homepage guess clicking link first downloading script redirecting legit site phishing unable hover find first link email service obscures safelinkprotection domain course good job protecting
325432,service could paste link email provider shows would simulate redirections show anything harmful gets downloaded
325433,best ignore emails mark spam everyone gets one degree another sign haveibeenpwned legit website go verify wikipedia etc free service notify web2 accounts ever compromised crypto quite possible point time ico something hacked spammers might targetting email address investigate things incognito browser window bother tbh especially unsure 
325434,curious know whats happening time dont want take effort spin vm
325435,also isnt phishing cos ethopian airlines email eventually redirects google flights search
325436,curious know whats happening seems abundantly obvious email leaked
325437,aside
325438,ask hn gmail spam control everyone else article comments
325439,bitcoin solves
325440,
325442,
325443,never would expected lol
325444,think checks links database reported links since email service masks underlying link security protection redirection link site doesnt really work
325445,know address attacked trying figure attack usual phishing link asking reset password even requiring login
325446,know use command line perhaps curl command help pass url tell follow redirects let know ends see 
325447,feel free dm example shortened url i'll test 
325448,great
325449, additional option sure checks redirects good resource nonetheless
325450,doesnt seem like email service masked first level redirection services seem checking database domain asis pasted
325451,shared screenshot emails link sonic sonic testing link otherwise email looks totally harmless interesting attack figure attack actually
325452,also attack sophisticated redirection service attacker running would change output based call made known security services potentially useless unless keep changing ips
325454,could run sandbox visit
325455,search google sandboxie
325456,give temp partition away rest system
325457,risking banned ivangbi quick shill community callannouncement today 
325458,finally mainnet soon

325491,strange domain sale
325492,thank guys check come back
325493,i'm dumb something like happen devs said
325494,
325495,we're giving ownership token contract
325496,like 51% attack would need votes say stop
325497,common sense kicked i've seen snapshot proposals like gib dev share plox devs say automated process
325498,fully chain governance build

325505,dao working intended
325506,noteworthy injustice done really working intended fault illiquid shitcoin gov token
325507,nobody said anything injustice interesting example happen fully commit chain governance news worthy
325508,blockfi agrees pay 100 million penalties pursue registration crypto lending product link
325509,mb fault holding majority
325510,100m penalties still pursue means must see massive upside baller move
325511,thats something prevented sybil checks biometrics social vouchers whats possible way eliminate attack completely
325512,first case kind respect crypto lending platforms sec chair gary gensler said todays settlement makes clear crypto markets must comply timetested securities laws securities act 1933 investment company act 1940 demonstrates commissions willingness work crypto platforms determine come compliance laws
325513,quoting almost 100 year old antiquated legislation joke
325514,add brockshane mix make special though
325515,apparently come compliance means gib 100 mill govt
325516,aaand enough legal today
325521,wrong
325522,willing research would look nick johnson's durin rari capital's nova

325532,hey community whale yet developer still want contribute fulltime space consider joining new hackathon nondevs there's 10k prizes 30k bounty prizes amazing sponsors
325536,hey everyone ive wondering something nfts royalties system currently way nfts generate royalties creator owner nft sold viewed lets say example im artist create unique nft instead selling get fee every time someone look nft similar system already exist would current nfts smartcontract system permit 
325537,protocols automatically royalties yes
325538,views chain would problematic connect onchain actions
325539,wouldnt possible make onchain like action view like temporary reveal process paying fee example 
325540,ask names please 
325541,well technically add something like reveal button trigger chain tx come tx cost terrible ux
325542, one
325543,nft marketplaces without royalties fees
325544,dont imagine happening current state nfts marketplaces eth glad know technically possible thanks input 
325545,look ty

325562,everyone space know founders projects rich people still get surprised get details much teams actually making
325563,there's difference detailing much made demented threat
325564,wasnt supporting 0xb1 fact questioning first tweet say team members cant make 500k month teams raise 50 100m every day days ofc one knows exactly gets spent
325565,additonally celsius team probably super rich actually fiduciary duties depositors yet played 0xb1 hypocritic comment begin anyway
325570,hello everyone wanted ask im developer interested web3 space id love pick freelance paid tasks would guys recommend check
325571,
325572,check

325576,solidly new name remember solidswap
325577,nice thread uni v3 curve v2 
325578,top 10 devs crypto atm
325579,would quantify amount dev shipped success projected worked users using product worked pretty subjective metric unless outlined imo
325580,yeh asking acurate list devs u respect general
325581,know they're anonymous keep setting new profiles
325582,nour zefram anish come mind

325589,wondering follow talk
325592,none trash
325593,dude working gearbox pretty good minting site made looked good fast execution interesting concept
325594,respectable defisafety score might add 
325595,gn lobster fam compiled thread methodology tools investigating crypto hacks security incidents 
325596,probably better us department justice atm

325600,fair take say mechanism used ensure good payout bad like saying goes show incentives show outcome case incentive core shareholders wash trade platform mars since collect majority eth back time farming massive percent future issued looks tokens wash trading rebate opposite side important users want play game speculate clearly written paper somebody got burned trying speculate read better next time
325601,anyone know axie's ronin chaiin open sourced

325608,sorry blockchain 101 wikipedia article please dont bring read kore cia sent bunch golden stuff basic is0095
325609,hey bringing anything wanted verify learning people interview
325610,sir really said interview would ended immediately please reread everything quite literally
325612,thats maybe probable incentive guaranteed outcome idk looks stuff got triggered im bit skepticism stands done nothing wrong casting worst fears anon team pulled well executed launch
325613,bitcoin private blockchain audit human loopholes formal verification ethereum per se rest wikipedia quotes couldnt really anyway gl studying raw enough 
325615,
325616,thanks
325617,think add damnvulnerabledefi ctf really fun teaches lot
325619,guide u get compromised 
325620,new nodes connect fantom dag model priority node connect connect many nodes possible ensure higher reward function based height nodes
325621,go read code base
325622, metamask revamping way manage networks specifically going curating networks allowing service providers want able provide default rpc access
325623, correct unless something changed last week sure get obnoxious warning prevent hitting save
325624,hey lobsters way short massets mnflx onchain today
325625,hey anyone good technical knowledge publishing nfts custom smart contracts default collections openseararible i'm struggling understand use case supported marketplaces need build something custom
325626,red warning use yellow instead
325627,hate reliable alternatives edge cases
325628,yes mirror protocol short
325629,yeah tweeted 
325630,reading academic paper way tell validators using kind algorithm node selection discussion would preferable ones
325631,chads got close end formula calc curve v2 il
325632,say learn programming paradigm would suggest start nonprogrammer friends ask really know answer apart try one time
325634,didnt make issue
325635,metamask refuses let dapps users control rpc changing default networks protect infura usage
325636,
325637,saw msg tried find list top devs crypto find one made one haha 
325638,sorry missed devs try keep updated
325639,nice where's credit hhh
325640,gave idea credit tweet ser 
325641,yeah know saying issue correct least week ago can't change infura stuff unsurprisingly consensys owns add another network chain id red notanerror interesting perception hack though
325642,ashachaf
325643, accurate solid emissions start feb24th 2 days
325644,yes 24th
325645,would andre say 17th
325646,hates
325648,
325649,
325650,
325651,sure posted
325652,blockminded favorite chain seems like scaling 41 validators time
325654,since can't change ethereum rpc literally locked editing metamask
325655,add new rpc new chain
325656,cant wait boosting throughput bsc
325657,41 total number nodes left standing
325658,requires 50tb nvme
325659,lemme try
325660,forking intended keep scaling increasing constants
325661,rebrand
325662,forking idk actually much details think rebrand tech people might slide github perhaps
325663,wait something build something worth forking first
325664,add new one works even says chain id resevved
325665,bnb chain comprised bnb beacon chain previously binance chain bnb chain governance staking voting bnb smart chain bsc previously binance smart chain evm compatible consensus layers hubs multichains
325666,yeah worked
325667,contribute geth would boss move instead got erigon save asses
325668,announcement talking scaling one chain multichain boosting throughput bsc thats asked
325669,yeah haha scaling 41 validators
325670,that's new name build n build
325671,20 validators
325672,21 extras case one 20 block proposers chokes
325673,consensus change afaik
325674,yeah nothing changes
325675,multichain hub moving cosmos like architecture
325676,41 vallidators current latency seems like night mare
325677,ah doesnt actually mean validator set 41 20 would reserves
325678,since metamask decided go vc
325679,since metamask enabled swaps really
325680,literally zero reasons like
325681,
325682,except good business
325683,may disagree neither affects bottom line meaningful way makes notareason
325684,one another 3 ctfs suggested cmichel's article andre's tweet
325685,least certain fruit company allow people use browsers digress
325686,hi lobsters wanted share quarterly reminder friend run archivenodeio public good ethereum devs free access archive nodes whatever purpose dont collectsell data plan profit ever anything weird like 
325687,soon affect bottom line promise
325688,first link yellow paper
325689,b c
325690,
325691,yay

325693,chase legend
325694,100% gets credit archivenode yell people tweeter
325695,
325696,wait red chain id error actually error
325697,worked clicked txs went guess
325698,6 years using metamask feel betrayed dumb
325699,create different one allow one chain id
325700,ssmccul
325701,add manually
325702,problem though ur using flashbotsopenmevedennetwork etc switch tabs close bring metamask back resend tx public mempool
325703,challenges opportunities founders building web3 projects 
325704,someone confirm indeed work see red warning click save network get added firefox latest metamask version 1092
325705,yes works well use brave though fed infura issues permanently moved pokt rpc
325707,bdw anyone used poktpool blockspace fraction pool pokt staking wanna check whats safest option dont wanna run pokt node directly
325708,addition poktpool tpokt launched thunderhead team give receipt token ala lido hopefully build good defi integrations thunderpoktfi 
325709,lobs good description bribecrvfinance works timelines bribes claims extra rules etc unlike votium i'm struggling figure
325710,added pokt rpc
325711,original infura still use different name easy identify

325790,recent comments subsequent discussions may interest 
325791,also pointed there's basically 2 ways auto compounders permissioned autocompounding permissionless autocompounding former protocol triggers compoundingharvest events pays gas entrusted making sure harvest event sandwiched mev bots latter compounding triggered permissionlessly usually depositwithdraw users eat gas cost compounding everyone's investment compounding events easily sandwiched can't force users use something like flashbots rpc
325792,tweet joey 
325793,thanks heads apy guys anything contract audits
325794,contracts interested audits audits strategiescontracts 
325795,screamsh contracts yearn perform kind audit utilized protocols
325796,would u stop eth automatically transferred wallet everyone time put
325797,strategy vetting process documented right there's rudimentary risk analysis framework that's used figure strategies need additional security attention believe screamsh compound fork strategy genlevcompound there's public risk dashboard available yearn watch see strategy high risk score probably getting audit time soon
325798,thanks lot
325799,bot discord also yearnwatch shows averaged aprs last 10 harvests yearnvision
325800,thank
325801,looks like earning something eth really hard
325802,nice would job thanks lot
325803,puts calls auctioned every friday ribbon team recently put together new ui bid auctions 
325804,i'm trying make monitor notifies transaction nft erc721erc1151 minted aka transfer null address x address eth way able monitor without abi original function called transaction im using ethersjs also apologies thats appropriate place question
325805,scream compound v2 fork need audits
325807,need collect funds send students conferences fiscal responsibility
325808,
325809,that's ppl say something usually altered code remember grim ftm autocomponder fork beefy got exploited changing 1 line iirc
325810,recommend reaching flashbots discord help sounds like exploited wallet usually help
325811,yes flashbots use whitehat hotline 
325812,normal deadline swapping tokens chains like fantom
325813,deadlines protocol specific chain specific worry
325814,provide argument func
325815,oh still need provide would uniswap eth
325816,manually google current unix time 20 mins
325817,thanks
325818,well check changes code tools defi summer believe master chef contract
325819,
325820,token emissions go stakers traders that's neat wash trading also neat low apy 
325821,arrhgg hate protocol doesnt incentivise wash trading shakes fist
325822,work comments trying bark projects pleb forgot focus makes somehow unique instead cried around idk meh strategy 
325825,still see parts modified original compound contracts try see ruggeable
325826,even make view tx think raises question dare say people right click save
325827,anyone know l2 solutions applied evm compatible l1s particularly avax
325828,mean fork say optimism run l2 top avax
325829,yeap
325830,theory possible doubt plugplay solution depends also optimism whatever software using implemented assume they're working ethereum's consensus rules easily tuned
325831,essentially work maybe secure way box
325832,thanks i'm thinking curious scenario
325833,layer 2s would need get traction eth first people start forking onto layer 1s 
325834,true
325838,signature metamask way extract ecdsa v r values
325839,entire signature string
325840,literally splitting hex string 3 parts r sig031 sig3263 v sig64
325841,sure i'm saying correct order though
325842,thanks lot ser 
325843,online tool run ecdsarecover
325844,know would usually write oneoff script
325845,hm create signature myetherwallet obtain hex string thats much longer 64 digits dont use ecdsa
325846,mew test i'm assuming looking sig field that's string 130 chars results 65 bytes total correct byte length signature
325848,last part 1c 0x1c 28 v
325849,rest split half get r
325850,sorry know put nontechnical approach
325851,thanks lot ser need convert chars hex number somehow
325852,r
325853,well depending split half manually understand read 64 character string 32byte value
325854,convert 32byte value hex
325855,tool using maybe need prepend 0x 3 values
325856,thank 
325857,curiosity timing x2y2 smart contract
325858,yes idea works im noob obviously trying stitch pieces together via google
325859,anyone know site publish vesting schedule calendar unlocking tokens popular tokens least
325860,way research better going token's smart contract read couldnt read white paper usually informs month date
325862,
325863,hm apparently v needs either 27 28 signature 1 though
325864,signature ends 01
325865,sure end 1b 1c 
325867,message sign specific format
325868,group us's biggest crypto players rolled solution form trust anchorage avanti bitgo bitflyer bittrex blockfi circle coinbase fidelity digital assetssm gemini kraken paxos robinhood standard custody trust symbridge tradestation zero hash zodia custody make founding members headed coinbase
325869,know cases eip155 27 28 necessarily result think 1 would possible choice maybe i'm running outdated knowledge though
325872,delphi
325873,mean one 
325874,yes
325875,couldnt see compiled vesting schedule site
325876,sorry meant messari bad

325892,bitgo hacked
325893,bitfinex
325894,omg truly life saver thank much 
325897,software use generate signature ser
325898,way decodeencode signature generated via myetherwallet translated signature correct ecdsa format ends 1b 1c
325899,read myetherwallet uses rlp encoding whatever dont find rlp decoder
325900,
325901,yea im confused though rlp seems used format different fields ethereum transaction nonce gas price etc want sign message transaction rlp shouldnt relevant
325902,myetherwallet randomly created key try see worked
325903,hm interesting create new address myetherwallet indeed gives signature 1b end connect ledger via metamask gives 01 end
325904, yes that's correct
325906,cryptocast0x stuff lobsterdao
325907,case ubuntu feels slow 
325908,ok looks like bug myetherwallet signatures correct end 1b 1c signing hot wallet incorrect signing via ledger connecting directly connecting via metamask known issue
325909,use ubuntu one trading laptops cexs ui horrible sometimes specially market wide dump occurs something start fly laptop much old good specs check thanks
325910,concerned heat issues might help ubuntu setting cores powersave mode i'm desktop set everything performance
325911,another way sign messages ledger using mew
325914,try mycrypto 
325915,ty ser problem
325916,let myhash keccak256 hash mymessage ecdsarecovermyhashvrs vrs coming signature myhash signature mymessage
325917,signature myhash
325918,ecrecover aware keccak hashes since recover expects bytes32 can't use arbitrary message lengths hash first
325919,oh also course avoid raw message visible tx payload often required privacy

325985,ib pumped hard enough soon announce next cream snapshot pnd one though farming starts today emissions next week everything next week
325986,one another one become bribe treasury another one vote lp tokens iron bank protocol give liquidity make tvl larger voting pool 2 meh meh moralleas discussion projects dont get diluted like vecrv keep
325988,think andre inserted votium inside core codebase possible cant read code lack info wait see smarter people say
325989,hypothetical case nice dev know project find good partner manage projecti think post job offer proper solution i'm looking tips
325990,isnt important part emission structure volumefees aka pool 2 deep liquidity volume get uninteresting users
325995,cool feature nurses approve harithk17
325996,thanks much ser chat nft page super new improved always appreciate feedback 
325997,literally added link legit projects want try feel free check hit dmz

325999,collab land discord worked like year gated chats already old 
326000,thx sharing
326001,curves supply growth rate
326002,633k day iirc
326003,boosted lp vecrv lockers take lps awarded curve inflation somehow
326004,knowledge boosts affect emissions
326005,convex boosted rewards lps take like 1015% reserve token econ like given stakers cvx etc afaik ye whether boosting affect total emitted amount weight
326006,yeah takes lps giving weight pool
326007,flat forever goes pools apy suppose builtin apy bonus pools contain curve eg multiples apy given pools
326008,reduces every year around august bonuses based pool tokens gauge weight
326011,thanks ser simply add 27 last byte create valid rsv values ecdsarecoverhashrsv
326012,17b curve eth release schedule shows 1b date trying understand total supply top shows 305b 225b purple seems 075b tokens whenhow emitted cmc cg show max supply 33b added reason 
326013,well that's max timeline getting cut 3b hundreds years away also vesting tokens already minted
326014,whats formula supplygrowth reduction 33b max cmc error really 303b
326015,anyone know good technical resources mainnet forking
326016,much vecrv needed full 25x boost per lp size ie whats formula

326066,hi anyone intro degenscore team want know story process creating degenscore
326067,angelomint
326068,wow thanks
326069,asked said wanted scoring process mystery 
326070,actually implementation detail like long implemented creative iteration process validation checking result release
326071,kind thing
326072,fwiw safe token confirmed 91% positive votes dunno spam someone already shared sorry repost c 
326073,anyone article guy discovered mint eth arbitrumother eth l2 use control f know i'm using wrong sequence words maybe posted
326074, optimism btw
326075,thanks sorry reason thought arb explains find
326076,anything hacks
326077,loooool
326078,difference signing message transaction technical level signing message proving one owns private keys signing transaction causing state change 
326080,mean like development purposes contentious forking
326081,development purposes want build defi simulator run current state wo using hardhat etc
326082,preferably go
326083,found simulatedbackend goethereum know use yet
326084,even general dexs breaking lp 'approval' sign message actually break sign transaction
326085,transaction includes nonce gas price gas limit value data
326086,include vs r
326087,signing message message address private key signed signature r v
326088,makes sense since signing message modify state gasless used example gave prove owner pk's
326089,tool alerts wallet receives token avax cchain tried ctrlf find anything sorry answered
326090,sure
326091,assume sign snowtraceio setup email alert way using etherscan
326092,try snowtrace
326093,etherscan runs snowtrace imagine functionality
326094,testing idex comparing dydx offchain clobs settle data blockchain one perps one spot one using xrks eth one settling polygon etc etc idex one sign message execute order dydx case like using centralized clob exchange
326095,hey hope fine one question anyone tell platform get automatically market capitalization smallshitcoins cause try via api coin gecko workthanks advance
326096,released uni v3 oracle attack simulator case anyone interested use make sure lending pools euler rari protocol using twaps right risk profile use case 
326097,fbi launching virtual asset exploitation unit blockchain analysis virtual asset seizure link
326098,also highly recommended start programming deep understanding data computations classic book mit video lectures 
326099,metamask asks sign message message could transaction careful also signing sure kind protections metamask place especially wary thing signing hash since guess valid ethereum transaction transaction lumped together via rpl signed hash transaction someone wants rekt via signature needs get sign hash guess
326100,metamask typically warn whenever sign hash directly use proper signed message api
326101,count gasless trade cowswap tax purposes
326102,paid gas cost token received believe
326103,would say signing message metamask always safe warnings
326104,taker
326105,used handful times every time paid equivalent fee whatever gas would token received swapped cant remember one look confirmation swap goes
326106,thx
326107,try different apis 
326108,know enough metamask internals assess whether always safe true
326109,eg see handle eth sign vs personal sign etc
326110,former used signed arbitrary tx latter cannot
326111,yall find tool extremely useful 
326112,ahem mean finance
326113,mean finance dcaing taking profit single price dripping resulting funds months years
326114,plenty reasons want spread get access sums money
326115,microsoft mentioned forta protocol article badger dao attack given example realtime threat detection help prevent cases
326116,actually looking something like interest bearing token think useful daos invested products like mstable save use apy pay operational cost
326117,single price sell happen immediately clear article steps suggests happens every year much like mean dca usdc would
326118,look overnightfi understood correctly build look
326119,we're working something separate principle interest rights 
326120,yeah sell happens immediately i'll see can't clear
326121,thanks check
326122,stablecoin backed yieldbearing stables profits payed every day

326152,anyone know revoke approvals terra blockchain 
326153,scammer belyakov like ape dump protection pool weird name btw wanna know base asset tbh usdc quoting options case falls strike 2100 buy eth basically anything collect premium 15% annualized
326154,exactly almost like limit order 15%apy top
326155,experitation weekly period price drops 2100
326156,buy 2100 suffer downside
326157,assume different ribbon case
326158,nerds exactly limit order work friday 8am utc like options universe price maturity time 2100 buy eth price drops 1500 friday come back lets say 2200 firday 8am utc nothing hapen still getting 15% apy
326159,btw friday 8am utc 
326160,personally use selling puts selling covered call strategies means 1 lock usdc 15% apr buy eth 30% one week 2 lock eth 20%apr sell eth 30% within week
326161,want apr happy strategy buying low selling high people oposite lol
326162,dapp sir 
326163,cat icon shilling opium
326164,dont tokens yet shilling hasnt paid yet
326165,opiumfinance
326166,haha trying dopex arbitrum seems new
326167,whats difference dopex actually curious
326168,ribbon tldr
326169,mint cat opium button top left corner
326171,ribbon strikes close current prices usually
326172,juliankoh maximize apy decides market risk
326173,sorry 100% familiar blz shill
326174,use lower strikes leverage opium uses high strike possible sell 12x leverage makes sense imo liquidations ribbon never opium
326175,never say never
326176,apr nicer
326177,also know ribbon liquidations options opyn liquidations opium need look exavtly liauidate
326178,liquidated actually like scenario
326179,like throw usdc vault w idea buy drops dont get eth cash settled usdc balance goes lower
326180,used ribbon thing dopex provide liquidity different strike price earn governance tokens rewards case position expires loss give rdpx tokens turn use platform buying options stuff create demand token dont believe inbuilt strategies like screenshot posted
326181,need look guess option liquidated underlying moves dont enough collateral
326182,also ribbon used take 20% fee profit 
326183,case liquidation concepts like dopex give rdpx tokens 
326184,liquidation opium slashing eth moves much case buy puts sell calls eth rewards idea interesing hm
326185,course strike price changing algorithmically every friday well limit order moving together price every week
326188,hey guys chance someone knows tool track multisig signer activity gnosis
326192,screen 51 min left till expiry
326193,always 10% afaik
326194,guess yearn team one maybe banteg milkyklim help
326195,want specifically one option would pool data chain another use gnosis api second one get inspiration 
326196,risk preset ribbon depends current implied volatility
326197,backtests show maximize profits covered call example constant delta strategys smartcontracts decide strike risk choosing strike closer delta value
326198,covered call delta 01 maximizes strategy outcomes 01 used calculate future strike values
326200,github links certainly helps thanks lot 
326201,thats delta 01 1 week expiry right
326202,problem emerging crypto option markets statistically stable imo better asses risks parametrs history words 2017 one backtest strategy long eth would show perfect results local crash words always find local highs lows backtest charts otherwise would flat line right question numbers statistically significant say use moving window revaluate results guess would careful imo like driving car looking back mirrow
326203,yep
326204,say high possible sell mean premium satisfy apy target strategy pretty much increasedecrease strike total premium falls target
326205,nope strike 3035% spot
326206,yes one carefull predicting future based past performance definitely adds strategy understanding
326207,premium auction starts minimum
326208,based educated guess
326209,eventually users choice take position particular strategy offers backtests help user choose guarantee future performance
326210,lowest liquid delta possible
326211,got thanks

326229,downside cannot use main bridge integrate third parties celer multichain maybe less secure
326230,
326232,
326233,less secure
326235,btw another downside want bridge token sidechains would bridge mainnet easier mint token mainnet move chains official bridges instead relying third parties
326236,makes sense
326237,thinking future maintenance third party bridges scenario
326238,official bridges support ethereum master contract wouldve thought eth competitors would support direction
326239,ctrlf'd ask good posts comparing dev tools general workflows infrastructure evm solana

326364,remind 64 execution shard limit less defined phase 3 iirc got link vb post etc
326365,remind us thatd true even postrollup world cant eth contract verify rollup contained tx contract l2 create one thats linked l1 guess moving back l2 l1 would create yet another contract cant consider nft whyisnt similar nft start eth go 2 different l2s
326366,afaik verifier verifies certain state transition occurred according rules nothing nothing less state must exist transition state s1 certain number blocks changed s2 l2 prover sends new state proof l1 verifier checks rules broken ie transition valid nothing existed hand obviously transition cannot occur i'm sure possible create contract l2 state transition point creating nft l2 create sc nft l1 anyway sorry long explanation think eth l1 separate universe know anything l2 pov eth nothing exists outside
326367,ok right mint collection need first done eth initial template
326368,general understanding think may possible create simple contract address id mapping baseuri populated later data elsewhere possibly data l2

326471,revokecash
326472,yes
326473,yes used etherscan approvals
326474,get etherscan slow
326475,youraddress
326476,etherscan decided go maintenance mode
326477,
326478,timely
326479,etherscan well
326480,direct link get nft contracts
326481,instead removing approvals transfer nft fresh wallet way easier approvals wipe clean new address
326482,easy way without approve open sea
326483,used mev dont even support batch transfers
326484,need approve order transfer unless want bulk transfer
326485,
326486,case helps another option
326487,oof looks big
326488,
326489,either 1 1 transfers fresh wallet b bulk wrap nfts nftx transfer fresh wallet c idk bulk transfer idk safe would rush something like
326490,
326491,
326493,
326494,completely usless nfts
326495,yeah etherscan seems one supporting erc721
326496,option b might useful rare stuff nftx charges like 10% targeted withdrawals
326497,worst part etherscan currently slow af can't even go contract revoke access
326498,i'm spinning revoke cash instance arcadia's local domain shortly
326499,try 
326501,transfer new address without approvals
326502,
326503,
326505,
326506,use chinese etherscan revoke ser
326507,safe
326508,oh ya looks legit
326509,looks legit
326510,check call data metamask sure approved false
326511,use debank
326512,also revokecash vpepo mentioned
326513,sadly revoke
326514,use chinese etherscan
326515,
326516,anish deployed new instance revoke
326517,gg anish
326518,either chinese etherscan new site anish
326519,maybe exploit confirmed though 
326520,anyone put touch people directly affected please
326521,day scare normies towards nfts quite time moar fud ze bear
326522,received one emails today ignored entirely
326523,

326544,maybe someone made offer reject
326545,lmao yeah idk anything bored ecosystem
326546,i've read chat phishing perfectly plausible theory got email thought might phishing verified url openseaio linked nft's approval set bad contract mentioned
326547, super clear likely explanation
326548,email
326549,hi guys equivalent revokecash site loading
326550,
326552,thankyou 
326553,
326554,could also use debank
326555,finally
326556,pretty sure that's attacker used valid signatures zero eth prices buy stolen nfts users sign point contractlevel exploit would've seen far damage
326557,btw actually one instance opensea contracts exploited cause hear people cry every week almost always wrong
326558,issue old contract mean migrating
326561,talking phishing attack
326562,one past
326563, suggests disconnecting mm stay safe 2k likes 13k retweets nft zoomers literary idea they're 
326564,
326565,can't steal offline wallets smooort 
326566,
326567,lol yet completely contradicts everything
326568,thanks syedjafri ye one true indeed
326569,time conduct hack
326570,everyone ethdenver etherscan downslow
326571,confusing rug 
326572,attack contract deployed 28 days ago theoretical phish could've happened time since even longer ago
326574,account tornado'd 51 days ago
326575,etherscan everyone checking revoking lol
326576,trick phishing ideally notice phished
326577,lol disconnecting 
326578,sounds rude discount iq avg bayc holder make rules
326579,yeah lol doubt person falls phishing email realizes
326580,disconnect metamask website issue resolved
326581,wasnt guy involved hacked wallet thing remembering wrong person
326582,disconnect metamask cold wallet ser
326583,yup attacks fail simple trick
326584,exploiters dont want know
326585,dont remember
326586,definitely phishing type mitm exploit swap sign data txs valid signatures users
326587,nft sifu
326588,
326589,
326590,ye seems like
326591,phishing
326595,remember uniswap made token lists combat listing fake tokens metamask contract list verified blue check contract deployer signing something could see deployer list verified addresses
326596,like opensea could register deployer addresses metamask would sign things came addresses
326597,yup something like google safe browsing contracts long overdue
326598,
326599,sure relevant
326600,save clueless user blindly signing shit presented tho
326601,relevant tweet 
326602,attack worked
326603,metamask consensys acquire etherscan theres lot ux improvement could make owned interaction auditing think
326604,god
326605,yeah know haha
326606,anyone find origin phishing yet emails shared come openseaio
326607,would prefer way around ehterscan seems lot clearer use increasing bloating metamask
326608,dont need etherscan destroyed well 
326609,seems migrating email sent os replicated scammer collect sigs
326610,nitpick signatures come addresses come ui entry points 99% time that's website
326611,serious question revoke functionality standard ui wallets technical reason use external website feels like buying car built brakes
326612,might've good old user clicks search result ad phishing well dirty deeds forward real site done course average user remember shit
326613,email want see phishing address
326614,insanely resilent considering growth use lately noticed captchas occasionally many bots
326615,yeah really appreciate etherscan saying someone pointed consensys acquire always issues metamask updates break stuff
326616,oh def dont know technical details sign message dont sign specific contract could picked contract depending message
326617,yeah signature frontrunning possible signature validation logic done poorly
326618,signature thought arbitrary message originating public key
326619,keyed specific endpoint unless that's part ur signing
326620, scammers activity anyone wants look weird behavior returning nfts owner sending back eth exploited well
326621,x2y2 theory still table sign similarly opaque thing bulk listing nate happened done apparently
326622,
326623,lol
326624,eh ignore opensea fault part 
326625,oh interesting
326628,first time see time delayed attack right
326629,
326630,badger's time delayed
326631,yeah
326632,badger
326633,yeah strange
326634,picked marcus124eth
326635,marcus immediately seemed tx blank wallet
326637,
326638,way revoke proxy contract os looks others need activate wallet even necessary
326640,one still knows phishing site url something isnt adding
326641,fellow lobs everything could dig hackerphisher
326642,anyone tools could assist mapping 1st 2nd 3rd order outgoing transactions 19 wallets hacker sent tiny funds 122 27 etherscan api key written code full network diagrams yet works
326643,dmed sir
326644,hard time admitting got phished lol
326648,anon acc w 0 followers claim undetstand tech redacted
326649,read convo
326650,hmm thread close month ago close date contract created
326651,allowed talk wont sry
326652,allowed random wannabes proclaiming know wo giving info larps
326653,spams people affected scared researching
326654,thread month ago
326655,one month ago likely account larping around wrathofend
326656,alright defi crazier things happen saying wouldnt far fetched
326657,open sea historically refunded users exploits directly connected systems right
326658,thought one time
326659,think blacklistmark stolen nfts
326660,think refunded got listing glitched
326661,remember correctly
326662,pretty sad tbh much less successful businesses crypto saved individuals due mistakes opensea seem near zero ethics bad competitors shite 
326663,im curious tho point acceptable keep blacklisting freeze assets decentralized ecosystem makes sense still centralized overall part major decisions especially valuable assets decision blacklist freeze prevent gain exploiter hacker put vote understand perfect world likely centralized clear decentralized system starts centralized grows become utopian decentralized world think question boils decentralization group eyes community builders contribute scenario
326664,web2 company website meanings word
326665,others following blacklisting bs patterns osspecific
326666,nothing discuss defi projects shift multisig pure governor alpha nft people nothing transititon protocols nothing works
326667,
326668,extends nfts
326669,exploits protocols draining funds
326670,blacklisting centralized marketplaces
326671,related topic
326672,phishing attacks moving assets tracked relevant idea policing blockchain entities created
326674,eyes useless discussion like hello kids like horses horns yes right decentralize everything without losing much flexibility w deployments potential changes keep decentralizing multisig governor alpha progressively
326675,2
326676,radial rug scam
326677,make update
326678,
326679,rug funds stolen either delivering slow delivering funds fine useless engagement almost zerorisk one eh whatever 
326680,governor alpha consist
326681,google

326684,sorry bit mean saying something missed point trying make cause sounds like 60yo politician rn sorry 3 cryptd0e
326685,hahah
326686,get
326687,ive beers maybe coming across right
326688,entire nft space platforms aside pics created either fiverr artist moneygrabs real artists trajectory anything w nfts depends said artist faithful good rely 1 person instead protocol even centralized ya although collections finished done art larp activity make people buy expectation something ye centralized team dao ok moreover usually change tokenuri make penis pics collection images instead however protocols displaying pics allowing interaction must decentralized cause os burger land working like web2 closed company suited reptiles web3 whatsoever total shitshow successful successful nft buyers people general even defi morons prefer credit card purchasers cause dumb prefer os web2 company approach emails authentication calling manager something goes wrong lol complain yes need alternatives looksrare far fine blabla usual old story meh
326689,copy adoption law government mean several stages different departments law canceled stage
326690,agreed think trying get hard people outside view entities like os web2 companies theyre based eth crypto decentralized marketplace guess im getting decentralization word abused marketing tactic hard reel actually happening space
326691,organizations work like today irl must reason yes change organizational structure much opens streamlines makes transparent people still though
326692,absolutely thanks got 
326696, anyone interested id say disregard political stances theres ties canadian issues rn great read also didnt realize would pop main chat
326697,dislike generalization
326698,nonplatforms nongenuine case defi liquidity abundant much less cause people rug always
326699,think possible learn solidity without experience programming 
326700,long would take decent learning fulltime
326701,definitely would highly recommend starting basic programming logic concepts jump
326702,thanks look first
326703,
326704,couple links add topic basedbuilders useweb3xyz

326710,comment wasnt really fair tldr 
326711,last 2 threads need know
326712,mean could already
326713,difference attack user signed generic calldata
326714,multi approve possible approve called erc721 contract individually example already approvedlisted nfts opensea contract least far understand
326715,attacker need waste time figuring nfts signtime
326716,oh dumb true true thanks
326717,victims essentially signed order saying attacker whatever want user proxy
326718,today attacker used take nfts
326719,education blogs practice newsletters analyzers found reaper discord server check time
326720,ivan really need bearish nfts work way
326721,never bullish fake jpeg stuff nonfake totally fine fun fk brands
326722,ok yes hater always
326723,let hate flow ivan 
326724,also maybe need 10k pfp collection subliminal propaganda teaching ppl manage keys trust strangers
326725,think pretty fair irony web3 chat mainly people quite get web3 situations like they'll shout rooftops web3 web2 vs web3 definition inclusivity web3 canceled get done click click clicking dodgy link contract etc becomes openseas fault anyone else point finger past wen refund
326726,lmao well said yes
326727,true also learning wyvern contract works scammers opensea docs feels bad anyone learning os onramp chance
326728,sure one really cares tech effects though regardless pretty pictures technical space kinda rub wanna play game part i've always subscribed poker ethos lessons learn life ones cost mosti guess perhaps help people along way learning experiences bayc taught us anything though probs 
326729,previous os exploit people cheap cancel listings 300k assets instead transferring wallets avoid 50 gas charge
326730,looking day didnt know start guess info apart stuff wvyern site
326731,also open sea use actual wyvern contracts fork 
326732,element darwinism sure crazily well funded product teams working space half decade verified contract blind signing zero onboardingeducational content friken emails big buttons get ppl migrate assets dont bother telling works etc
326733,totally agree also os fault exactly blameless either could much much better course think know

326808,much better look
326809,anyone binance could give hand please
326810,yeah sure whats
326811,trying get phished
326812,yea thought
326813,really need someone lol
326818,merkle proofs tornado oct 17 2021 railgun jul 9 2021 one older regardless merkle proof verification pretty standard thing like ask write power function using forloops implementation almost i'm going argue merkle proof circuit pioneered wanted point railgun code merkle proof tornado copypaste second image compare two different things commitments vs nullifiers check code commitments nullifiers computed differently mere variable changes
326819,maci circom code two years ago i'm pretty sure 
326820,also can't find similarities smart contracts please share parts think copypaste
326821,said merkle proof verification standard thing find lot similarities part different projects
326823,looked maci merkle tree developing circuits railgun good repository helpful stuff still show copypaste code
326824,linked rg repo link
326826,also tone accusation months take thought healthy discussion going around standard merkle proof verification ignoring entire code circuits contracts
326828,worries wondering copypaste former uses switchers latter uses mimc dualmux selectors even old tornado code different also i'm wondering similarities contracts code can't find
326831,shift tone replying comment railgun copied tornado code pointed difference i'm accusing aggressive project learned many opensource projects including tornado cash share respect time i'm showing railgun copypaste tech evidences
326833,lied comparing tornadonova code railgun code said everything copypaste including contracts fixating merkle proof different implementation even old tornado 2020 point let's stay healthy discussion benefit compare tech without accusing copypaste scam providing nothing new
326834,could share opensource code repository audit reports learn tech buccaneer v3 compare railgun without know talk
326835,related product wanted share relevant info
326836, 
326837,i'm tech guy also cryptographer understand cryptographic protocols code technical stuff also heard dcg recently invested railgun wonder large top fund would invest scam damage reputation cryptographers analysts advise project invest
326838,sortof ontopic originally intrigued railgun bc ability run defi apps privately dapps today j use anonymously via railgun eg aave
326839,generic adapter contract written support calling smart contract functions like aave course custom one aave better
326841,platform looks like 1 manager opens vault strategies perp 2 investors add funds vault 3 get profit trading share revenue
326843,hope coins pump nice day

326985,brilliant copy pasting another channel 
326986,noticed there's many different ways block attack hard
326987,said one question thats present spamming fud ad hominem think white hat recieved adquate compensation
326988,unfotunately cant repond points youve raised right grossly misrepresenting amounts calculations favor making seem much complex
326989,read blockchain state math perhaps could point got wrong right numbers instead spouting fud
326990,dont throw devs bus takes high level understanding complex systems able find issues sum offered make devs reconsider future ecosystem whole suffers
326991,anyways forum debate
326993,fair comment tho
326994,posting back attacked people's reputations 'failure' 'disgraceful' quite unfairly know chose typically best way handle type situation make things transparent share truth let people decide truth fears examination
326995,ye blz bring math u wanna argue article seemed detail point details better write ur piece cause dissecting would 1000 msg convo
326997,agreed
326998,wtf
326999,whole copy paste massive list arguments def good way conversation
327000,fuck
327001,even fucked 
327002,aint npm supply chain shit
327003,like nationstate level threat actor
327004,sense making fud sure feel white hats evenly compensated else peanut bounty tempt good white hats rather attack instead helping projects even coinbase recently gave like 150k market nuking bug fair tbh
327005,bitching safe harbour payouts go sell zero day somewhere

327015,seen domain hijacking b4 wrt cream attack last year
327016,great read topic 
327017,well heres math heres polygon staking contract 4b matic staked means singleiteration attack get total stake single validator 23 takes 16b 4b x 066 x solve x checkpoint interval 5120 blocks 2 seconds see checkpointblockinterval makes checkpoint time 2 hours 50 minutes even see announcement want get number checkpoints arbitrary stake solve 4b x 066 x gives 398 checkpoints 10m 38 checkpoints 100m trust take math dunno dont feel confident ability hide nefarious dealings blockchain 9 whole days
327018, 2 researches add topic 
327019,
327020,sorry disturb pro level info recently launched coin put exchange got rugpulled someone else liquidity put little obviously n00b mistake communitiesforums learn avoid noob mistakes future

327030,also nice updating post morten false information
327031,please check year announcement
327032,calculations bug fix actually even worse
327033,tools meant investors checking see token rugpull i'm saying token launcher attack vectors aware one get educated
327034,nailed lack imagination always either dont like capitalism
327036,ah youre actually correct
327037,twitter without weirdness they're introducing days

327057,
327058,important thing remember flashbots covers major defi bluechip mev total amount skimmed far far higher 
327059,hey lobsters interested defi option vaults weve backtested complex option strategies one appeared profitable long call short two calls cover first sold call spot second one bought call hope see liquidity option amms near future integrate complex option strategies vault needs amm buy option 
327060,abt cost
327061,cost
327062,strategy cost 1 long call roughly equals two shrted calls depends market
327063,position pnl right
327064,ah yeh thats price options
327065,yeah build vaults outsource amm part
327066,
327067,working adapters lyra protocol
327069,limited strikes right
327070,yes double short call strategy choose strike nearest spot price trade time

327073,updates nansen partnership
327074,please join lobsterdao dao qs main chat stay techfocused active work collab underway follow nansens twitter accounts miss anything news soon hear sure also check havent already 
327076,questions others might well believe pertinent chat feel free delete let know 2 months away graduating cs degree already know solidity crypto 2 years touch teams turns underestimate skills however ignorant high level expertise people know far reaching similar level given academic research topics related crypto seems like something university offer least current perspective might ignorant details would recommend joining team grow organically would spend however long takes even 2 years learn research much possible shadows without committing actual project words afraid lack learning resources bc excessive information feel somehow anyone wants make impact needs like mentor order bootstrap successful career crypto formal education path also lack internships often rejection simply based experience age discouraging times many developers want jump ahead web3 get job instead looking true mentorship learning experience believe correct path getting started dgaf salary focus learning
327077,i'd join team gain reallife experience
327078,part get example team delegates complicated defi implementation prone mistakes really trust skills
327079,i'd paragraph wall text first
327080,isnt like inherent time pressure developer solve something even delivered could lead undesirable consequences 
327081,end something similar andre comments articles time would like responsability lies back junior dev middle career
327082,time experience individual team team delegates task head that's team decision failing either raise hand time let know maybe someone misjudged skills either way team's fault likely catch time someone able pick
327083,agree
327084,trust skills trust ignorance awareness also trust team's skill trust human able wrong always scope
327085,though put position one looking code largeimportant tasks outside know know also know know communicate worst possible thing bottle can't get done failed tell people could set team back could happily helped made arrangements worry 
327086,also many cool projects around there's def comfy spot somewhere they'd stoked someone skills think there's great chance find something really suits starting overwhelming grow learn
327087,anyone remember site see mker dao cdp positions liquidations
327088,whats happening polygon
327089,much usuals
327090,block reorgs common problem polygon ended moving gnosis chain apparently theres v3 version coming soon instant finality

327137,announcement
327138,supposedly something announced 7 minutes
327139,
327140,alleged launch public testnet zksync 20
327141,announcement

327145,afaik dapp may fit purposes maybe 
327147,194 block deep reorg polygon pos chain 
327148,maybe cordinape requestfinance
327151,didnt get reorg chain officially save exploit something
327152,coordinape automatic afaik payments still done manually
327153,mb sablier
327154,shat fucking joke platform's can't run properly polygon shitshow
327156, farm42 something add collection
327157,thank read airgapcomputercom already
327158,i'm mistaken that's cool selfmade crypto hardware wallets big capacitors make attack hard perform epoxy course
327159,theres reason assume attacks exist wild executing one would require planting malware target machines making quite difficult though impossible article anyway add opsec repository separately much thanks 
327160,app supporting already beside bridging transfers
327161,solana
327162,know happy corrected tho
327163,interacting zksync portal 20 ordinary degen 
327164,reviewing past discussions topic user accuses lack communication primary validators backup bor way backup validator starts producing blocks primary validator isnt producing propagate network primary returns delay manages reject backup blocks put back network notwell synchronized globally things happen think however still wellestablished official research article
327165,get error time simple send also mm set gas price see setting maxpriority fees
327166,makerdao something like remember conti mentioning something podcast
327167,superfluid used think although sure state since recent hack
327168, seems pretty mature product anyone vouch
327169,thanks salary app responses definitely helps narrow one use
327170,months ago posted salary invoicing dapps 
327171,tried fan invoices correct information required local authorities directly transfer exchange

327173,mute seems live testnet 
327174,lol need research headline sounds like put eggs 1 basket
327175,maybe 
327176,ideas fix tried using high gwei matic clear stuck prior tx using nonce always gives error trying simple send
327177,error warning looks like much still hit save
327178,gas limit assuming bit simple send
327179,get eror save confirm 
327180,yes increased case also tried 21000 normal
327181,hello everyone quick warning anyone ever interacted dsd maybe someone help decipher wallet funded days ago buying tokens quorum intiated onchain vote edit proposal add wallet minter contract pool would approved usdc ever provided liquidity 
327182,sent 0 matic using custom nonce earliest stuck tx
327183,based went hard makes realise probably rotate wallets reasons like
327184,ethereum future guess periodic reminder use revokecash remove un needed approvals
327185,yes also tried sending another account 0 error
327186,rotate wallets
327187,may able ctrl shift j see actual error least windows
327188,longer sure there's anything stuck reset history mm see what's processed nonceaddress
327189,i'm mac
327190,never reset history situation sure implys
327191,implies
327192,anything happening chain
327193,pending nonce
327194,afaik dont disappear lol
327195,never polyscan guess cuz never started processing nothing stuck polyscan
327196,send address another
327197,i'd love blame polygon 50c soon input resetting metamask lol hate personally
327198,interesting types exploits never happen tokens native assets funky erc workaround contracts wallet rotationapproval revoking concern
327199,tried resetting
327200,happened chomsky
327201,like reinstalled still issue
327202,macos professional's os 
327203,
327204,real one defi group og
327205,nothing console here's expanded mm tx failure
327206,pretty clear nonce low
327207,looks like pending tx something
327208,ya expanded found works without custom nonce sure work
327209,well pending
327210,finally cleared
327211,anyone dextools solidly added point
327212,error advise send would still go
327213,meantime solidly trading data already available dexguru
327214,thanks
327215,
327216,also dont happen newer erc contracts something can't happen encode many assumptions blockchain
327217,think question assumptions make ethereum created without concept tokens eth different wethwbtc every token handled ledger asset equal eth behavior lot stuff would likely much better obviously issues usecases conceptualized back surprising optimized around
327218,actually eth worse erc20s
327219,that's weth exists
327220,thing approvals even possible eth explicitly send amount get back change clearly worse design saying much take dont use revoke fact problem erc20 requires separate txns approving revoking super great paying 5 tx
327221,came ways permit particular txn already late bunch erc20s everyone keeps deploying basic bitch tokens instead ones support good features dai supports good features example
327222,swap dai uniswap without explicit approvals without infinite trust
327223,hello way analyze tornado cash withdrawals
327224,life finds way
327225,
327226,i'm aware said designed around concept assets interaction smart contracts patches try fix still mine field users devs need traverse
327227,aye guys could someone give hand i'm stuck signing messages metamask 
327228,examples chains tokens native assets play well approvalpermit pattern cardano else handle programmably manipulating assets
327230,whoever responded message i've verified contract
327231,cardano one yes there's others basically need permit since there's reason anyone access tokens without consent part interacting contract sending tokens
327232,chains notification handlers receiving tokens aka simply transferring contract trigger action contract

327260,
327261,opensea web20 style hacks hacks contd
327262,might nitpicking referred opensea hack might well call email hack really dont see opensea responsible users deciding sign malicious shit
327263,layer 2 rolling strikes token burn 
327265,well known issue even erc draft fixing generally look opensea good reason targeted eg look svg xss hack high value target also lot uneducated users fact opensea's responsiblity users
327266,fact opensea's responsiblity users cant agree opensea held responsible people blindly signing txs zero understanding way system works
327267,profit money get rekt another person's fault naisu
327268,says lot average nft coooolector
327269,fair think says mileage space wanting others protect web2 mentality web3 take ownership action
327270,retail care ownership want buy sell colorful lottery tickets see traction altl1s like bsc solana fueled users
327271,agreed phrasing opensea bughack misleading

327285,also check 
327286,nope wallet they're stored contract similar ethereum ethereum tokens stored always contracts projects looking unique ways wallets accounts behave specifically provide access i'm assuming weird stuff like infinite approval random smart contracts specialized behavior instance giving mobile wallet access ledger wallet x tokens per day instance
327287,sounds cool know find projects
327288,sent dm
327289,hello lobsters maybe someone help tell near sharding atomicity preserved near sharding
327290,think atomicity form sequential composability across shards takes several blocks instead atomic

327404,i'd suggest trying fresh chromium browser metamask extension brave bromite chrome edge install plugins except metamask may wallets interfering wild guess
327406,article post best hardware wallets also poll history there's much value going previous polls group like
327407,i've seen firefox fixing problem similar problems
327408,
327409,ahhhhhhhhhhhh
327410,failed ones didnt use check already amount noneligible consumes low gas oxngmi
327411,idk done know w merkle claim idk
327412,honestly failing transactions flashbot protect rpc exsits 2021 
327413,high gas cost due erroring failing late execution presumably due high base fee ivangbi
327414,seriousness would good suggested mint pages
327415,none blocks got minted flasbots used flashbots able mint anything
327416,furthermore afaik flashbots includes first txs 1 tx idk block worked i'm sure asked publicly dm'd people work flashbots get answer tell people use rpc
327417,know flashbots included first tx block i'm sure case still
327418,weird since supposed massive chunk miners bad luck i'd guess
327419,nah afaik flashbots enabled add much txs include block found edge cases eval tx include
327420,broke couple times 
327421,ah makes sense tho
327422,shitting btw regards protect rpc
327423,block 10 flashbots mints afaik 
327424,true check total supply way earlier code would saved gas costs failing txs however people blowing proportion since large part gas costs fixed things signature verification tx consume
327425,
327426,might wrong checked quoting someone said
327427,yeah mints flashbots
327428,ok perfect got thanks definitely interesting work u pics look cute id minted wl
327429,bashing ser opposite
327430,tbh risk analysis flashbots works great people save gas costs flashbots issue prevents people minting eg txs included much tx volume causes go may edge cases break every user able mint bots would people would flamed us lot
327431,since know one people get back time opted ask people switch flashbots
327432,large amount still botted tho
327433,seems like reasonable analysis also making users go protect would put burden know ecosystem incentives lol
327434,yeah i'm still sure right decision

327524,havent used trust wallet seed phrase ie different derivation paths 
327525,would easy ofc diff 12 word seed every time
327526,two longshot ideas remember trustwallet annoying taking data backup may happened though b recall correctly need reenter seed phrase using wallet c device rarely used tiny chance could recover overwritten screenshot sure helpful wanted share case
327527,b sure doesnt help much tho ages ago c could done durov sends deleted screenshot 6 months ago
327528,transfer screenshots phone backup location u renamed files u take screenshots seed twice transferred

327619,sometimes get issue firefox solution
327620,anyone participating solidly seems working well currently good bit ui bugs perhaps
327621,going browsers extension manager toggling metamask back fixes super annoying none less fix happens
327623,yes
327624,enough balance something something
327626,think rewards working solidly either
327627,staked 20 mins zero rewards claim
327628,that's probably nft holder design think lots ain't passing along
327629,got worked times
327630,mean can't deposit liquidity lp get rewards
327631,filter function see deposit lp unnecessary improved ui
327632,tarot feature called boostmax gives 25x boost solidly lps
327633,claimable solid
327634,know difference stable variable lps solidly chance
327635,stable lps like kind assets stable coins pools wbtcrenbtc volatile lps uncorrelatedvolatile asset pairs altcoinwftm look vote page see pairs emission votes nft holding protocols see pair volatile stable dont know looking two assets
327636,nice come variable pools stables well diff balances ie 5050
327637,id imagine people dont know ui allows one choose variable stable
327638,stable pools solidly unbalanced
327639,used variable version stable lps yeah strange
327640,ya lps staked tarot boostmax actually functional claimable solidex apparently issues solidly ui showing rewards right stable pools whack least ui dont feel like making bad move jumping balance stable pool gonna let everything calm fantom moving really slow well
327641,solidex appear screwed voting contract deployed unverified early partners currently voteweight period
327642,guys tarot true professionals
327643,equal first emissions apply votes week 2 actually looked spitballing
327644,disagree project still unaudited best knowledge understand climate least implement bug bounty fill gap complex project cares enough compliance blocks using without vpn canada surprising implemented either features

327646,that's nice mean slight character there's definitely work done
327647,confirm pleasant irl good standards still much work
327648,vpn comment stands legitimacy hear comments bug bountyaudit agree
327649,sr stupid question could use stable coins gas using zksync l2 eth 
327650,initial observations usdcmim pool solidly non incentivized volatile pool dont know anyone would deposit almost perfectly balance relatively low tvl incentivized stable pool way balance 1 usdc 118 mim ton tvl
327651,cant even arbitrage least swap ui
327652,exactly really sure imbalance matters
327653,idk ser doesnt look professional trustworthy
327654,whole launch complete shitshow
327655,whats weird looking adding usdcmim pool overweight mim select stable pair wants put mim
327657,

327749,got thanks samuel try
327750,publicly accessible curated database maps contract addresses form human name eg etherscan friendly name opensea registry im looking facility doesnt necessarily rely etherscans api preferably includes chains
327751,data solidly loads unfortunately without vpn
327752,ui doesnt works well metamask issues
327753,anybody know get binance holdings account certain date
327754,tried importing history api ftx delta graph trash completely accurate
327755,saw post derivatives protcol recently funding rates baked token basically hold tokens anyone remember seeing remember name

327761, search github lots terra anchor github projects python
327762,
327763,feel etf style option vault outperform market say even consistent yield hard iv theta gain reduced lot since ribbon first started lot vaults see deploying 10 delta otm strategy 20% away otm strategies approach feels nonsustainable well computation move offchain make room sophesticated strategies rebalancing according greek exposure
327764,something like gamma strategiesvizor finance uniswap lp strategies
327765,vote low risk dovs
327766,also even strategy doesnt outperform market could benefit trader via beta dovs lessen correlation market
327767,vote multistrategy dovs
327768,covered calls massively underperformed market whole bull run going cash secured put vaults markets going
327769,isnt predictable like choose dov acc market position
327770,guessing game though 1520 delta move going investors lose capital
327771,solidex accurate
327772,dovs interesting though executed correctly ribbon moving towards offchain computation strike price decision making
327773,understand use autoregressive model calculate volatility something like arch model calculate volatility range
327774,would mean active management people comfortable
327775,
327776,first ban selling erase losses must nice

328022,best answer rpc issues crypto suffers pocket network
328023,fellow lobs deep solidly general strat farm lps solidex harvest solid venft lock sex sexwftm lp stake solidex obviously next epoch happens solidex fixes voting fuckup rewards sex native lps drastically decrease two points questions 1 venft rebase preserve share solid ownership aka 33 component 2 value sex alone relatively worthless since used get tokenized venft would imagine proxy price solid since emissions move w solid emissions fix fuckup emissions decrease think cause decrease price sex aka im trying figure vacate sexwftm lp
328024,also another point big ol positive feedback loop fly wheel like farming fantom sometime accumulated lot fantom ecosystem lps printing solidly rewards emissions solidly game changing also dont dilute ecosystem lps benefit protocols lps represent buying dips preparation solidly move also shout ivangbi radial airdrop lob nft holders radial bootstrapping ceremony big win christ
328025, also shout ivangbi radial airdrop lob nft holders radial bootstrapping ceremony big win christ aable radial airdrops got actually pretty big happy per se radial nothing yet one many opportunities anyway important part quality attention lobsters diluted case become soso cause direct push marketing engagement people see act seems like fine thin line idk

328387,full error much longer
328388,please try different fantom rpc sorry spam kind admins
328389,ah cheers sir yeah sorry solidly spam
328391,anyway place stake solidex staking tokens
328394,scroll ctrlf removed
328395,aside would ever use negative error code
328396,much less 32000
328397,thanks reaper byte masons going punished behavior
328398,considering they're pretty much fantom native gets i'm kinda suprised andre come swinging folks like bytemasons reason fantom opera grown much bebis one first devs met started working space andre also fantastic dev chain owes relevance they're fighting shame reasonably speaking bytemasons middle launch devs know absolute burnout exhaustion comes sounds like bothered deal solidly week set way kick road next vote token would live i'm suprised many immediately jumping malice hanlon's razer dictates dumb joke land right complicated fact think many teams using solidly right fully understand implications actions well andre said andre middle launch morons twitter blaming rpc issues control suprise man hair trigger kept farming token nobody could buy would indicate malice seems like case frayed nerves exhasuted devs people jumping conclusions rest solidly holders could vote punish that'd zerosum game emissions make much sense unlikley happen
328399,read something andre taking away fantom developer incentives even possible
328400,sleepy dev strikes
328401,foundation one provides incentives believe full leeway gets technically yes foundation solely andre bytemasons frens it'd fairly unlikely
328402,bruh wtf require statement
328403,
328404,take andre went lengths avoid exact fake pool scenario downvote system happen week 1 struck nerve ofc
328405,upbit commit kill exchange liquidity
328406,also trash token ido raised lot money code based yearn lot marketing autocompounder help ftm ecosystem beefy around already took part pie raised culty community worships bebis reason
328409,hi actually topic trying learn incentives fantom ecosystem fund supposed programmatic based criteria like tvl also grants program mostly stopped focusing since announcement ecosystem fund 370m ftm incentives
328411,please dont post tg chats links mention answer like check solidex tg chat many scam chats names incredibly hard check admins
328412,shit talking andre times achievements made far forking andres protocols nearly losing millions users funds releasing token
328413,sounds like danieleshit
328415,apart danielle's debacle teams around popsicle abra actually delivered forks afaik
328416,abra fork
328417,popsicle also didnt really work
328418,query teams operated within parameters code reaper byte masons unethically according people andre punished decentralized foundation fantom foundation andre alone even authority gossip decision making process far consequential one incident
328419,advertised aprs completely reality plus got hacked
328420,gossip
328421,also foundation decentralized entity
328422,appreciate clarification thank
328423,created next fundraise idea someone decentralized foundation dao
328424,think see andress upset every protocol received nft decided get together farm tokens access results state theyre ones getting solid entire goal endeavor tvl snapshot rendered pointless goal distribute solid projects token holders projects vote emissions onto one project votes nontrading token get solid nft entitles since lps increases voting power letting direct solid back may even elements prisoners dilemma sure havent considered mechanism thoroughly potentially makes possible drain value away solidly since arent bringing fees value protocol taking value system solid tokens
328425,anything done
328428,general situation flaw mechanism design nothing hope isnt element prisoners dilemma bm kinda special case since arent dao daos arent impacted since governed holders want solid tokens also wanting liquidity demand token specific case wait see happens solid tokens farm im right isnt malicious bm probably distribute community lp incentives lock however would mean something altogether different solid tokens locked nondilutive means first round emissions always voting power subsequent ones lock rather distribute solid tokens make thatd indicative unethical behavior andre ascribed
328431,exactly

328445,like team saying fork disengenous
328446,fork lork

328450,ip retained community
328451,value extract carcass
328452,mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
328453,true false yearns sphere influence shifting ethereum fantom
328454,social influence perhaps capital still remains mainnet heavy deployed arbitrum though might shift i'd argue comes people using yearn fairly risk averse small increase price gas significant perceived increased chain security vs ftm mean lot people going bridge arbitrum
328455,plus ftm unbearably congested atm
328456,based observation group many technical members wonder someone interested cultural part joined cultural related web3 community think culturebesides technology another kernal drive web3
328457,tech culture isnt culture
328458,good argument mention culture others less possible take tech consideration
328459,shitty time want solidex unfathomable lead locks dont love bm time competition eventually result solidex oxdaov2 good farmers users
328460,yes 100% governance structures also factor there's much projects tech much roles often taken granted
328462,want devolve nft chat way typically view nft communities involved 'more culture'
328463,anywhere get 1000eth flash loan free days 
328464,free never could flash loan aave places pay fee
328465,dydx used free
328466,tried dodo
328467,idk much eth though
328468,nft culture part defi area also take culture consideration fact talk culture know culture makerdao podcast cluture discussion around defi fouders
328469,hello gents mint acquire lobster nft
328470,gm sir get one market please join lobsterdao 3
328471,since culture pretty hard define kind things think defi protocols talking aboutconsidering 
328472,thanx sir however would like get free exchange contributions etc etc
328473,make proposal work dao eg making dashboard bot research check issues readme also please write ideas lobsterdao good ones always supported gov voting 
328474,several defi daos ive seen think cultures quite bit sometimes publicly yearn good example
328475,hm sure say culture sense ethical builders slow bit take security seriously diligent vs fork stuff make sure sticks experimental approach culture building guess influences branding general culture preferences irl people families views would say strong debate subjective factors take account disagreements encounter within group potential conflict points create start code conduct shit kills dao vibes makes formal leads dame type wannabe tweeting builder culture focus building cool anything else subjective scope left people deal irl
328477,id agree successful cultural wayfinding daos usually feels like memes rich conversation leading sometimes art branding supports coherent working culture often feeling belonging meaning builders token holders without needing define things unnaturally
328478,culture meaning different things based context mix societal culture organizational culture etc kinda often easy get debates coming different povs imo
328479,ye organizational structure
328480,yes v messy especially turn organizations decentralized org culture ecosystem wide etc meanwhile v common nft peeps comment culture nfts yes true different
328481,coming pfps culture pnding jpegs anyway brand style culture people simple floor trading degens defi except instead finance open blabla ethos root creator ethos
328482,tradeable culture vs culture traders kinda like hyperfinancialization culture vs culture hyperfinancialization vs internal culture finance organizations
328484,sarthakbiswas94 sorry intro wikipedia headline content u depth tech econ send
328485,anybody explain transaction solidly looks like 15m solid minted initial distribution took place 
328486,mostly agree daos descend bikeshedding hell far exceed conventional orgs become talking shops feelings etc especially since drop basic management loose notions freedom reaching consensus shared principles shared mental models ways working could call organisational culture probably important daos elsewhere
328487,
328488,already compressed
328489,deltaneutral strats yes though would specify band 915% depending ones definition sustainable
328490, add overlays increase 30% affects scalability strategy
328491,dont hedge
328496,
328497,loool minecraft plugin 2012 using amm curve
328498,experience best cultures organizations arise bottomup result productive work everyone much fun making money care grievances identity politics zerosum stuff building something together creates rapport cultural practices established people trenches contrast organization tries push topdown engineered culture lot people unresponsive doesnt fit quite right management tries enforce political means hr stuff mandatory trainings etc leading less productive work angst vicious cycle
328499,agree ivan prioritizing building form rest come naturally
328500,totally agree think behave like get rugged hr vast majority hierarchical orgs end daos far implicitly bottom structures imo potential really interesting things self organisation emergence rather behave like else
328501,think 
328502,seems there's mind gap engineers artists
328503,two conversations culture happening parallel
328504,material nft avenue
328505,defi vs nfts engineers vs artists pfp vs art tiresome jfc
328506,first tx epoch change 0000 utc thursday triggered mint 15m solid due farmed week
328507,thank reply 15m rewards first week know much read andre's initial post something 2m per week guess initial idea changed later process
328508,changed yes
328509,happen know much decreases every week influenced increasing percentage locked tokens
328510,complex yes
328511,anywhere check emission schedule 
328512,totally accurate solid locked testnet running week ahead
328513,
328520,thanks bruh
328522,
328523,werent emissions supposed correlated earned trading fees given pool current high aprs solidly pools coming solely dilution protection fantom protocols venfts redistributed community members via pools
328528,incentives correlated pools trading fees based behaviourpsychology hard coded want make money vote pools volume bribes
328529,getting forks tweaks bsc metis arbitrum
328530,details
328531,bilidly bsc zeus metis cant remember name one building arbitrum
328532,arbolidly
328533,hermes mtis 
328534,guys know contact person wrote article points incorrect wanna revise
328535,u contact direct contact person
328536,andre mad vanish twitter medium longer
328537,maybe needs rest
328538,hermes starstream financial metis
328542,chad
328543,alt account find
328544,deleting twitter know made
328545,andre deleted
328546,let man rest detox one doesnt go afk social media hunted back asked
328548,yep releases something awesome clearly states ape 10million entitled pussies dont become trillionaires overnight lots people break balls every platform disappers minute comes back 10x better
328549,hey lobsters anybody know become axie infinity ronin chain validator 
328550,think need apply sky mavis
328552,another quick question solid find answer rewards vesolid stakers accounted week snapshot based accrue per block words matter lock thursday
328553,snapshot based per block
328554,emissions voted proportional circulating supply iirc fees go lps lps staked get solid instead groups use nft vote pool get fees
328557,token cannot traded hold one initial nfts keep voting token get 100% solid nft's voting power worth rather incentivizing people provide lps pool instead able parasitize solid dump market think that's going possible definitely flaw design
328558,think hope biggest protocols within community would also act best interests community large rather
328559,think needs coordination though shouldnt one player shouldering burden
328560,bebis saying limited time react much hard work pushed onto could period deploy 2 tokens farm 100% that's kinda bullshit month codebase public 2 weeks nft distribution emissions starting can't figure deploy 2 tokens 2 weeks well
328561,protocols built mostly blabla forks tokens slapped cant assumed acting good faith
328562,also lol bebis' greatest contribution forking yearn 8 figure raise said fork
328563,imagine andre guy raise using code moaning hard done handed millions dollars free money
328564,sounds like circular pain ouch
328565,sounds like daniele
328566,find time exceptionally busy schedule maximize amount returns personally gets short term rather actually trying right project whole thus ecosystem
328567,see he's super impressed whole thing
328568,reasonably speaking included daos like said i'm giving bm benefit doubt they'll distribute solid community set conversation aside mechanism design effective daos teams live tokens ineffective others feel sympathetic andre realizing missed spot mechanism design terrible feeling especially blind spot driven humans computers
328569,sure say andre's fault system allowed bebis act like piece feces
328570,bebis still shitbag
328571,code law
328572,guess debate
328573,ser ur every comment 
328574,idk 1010 tbh
328575,thanks
328576,none andre's fault perse blindspot allowed sort situation exist tokens protocols got nft choose line ones daos obviously since want incentivize token pretending system encouragesallows negative behavior flawed system false experiment seeing one flaws experiment possibility outcome mean experiment fail especially benefit doubt turns correct mean mechanism flawed certainly mistakes happen system survives good system learned something
328578,still solvable problem still early antagonistic voting calculable cost theres coordination spread burden bad actors still deterred
328579,nobody trying say anything negative andre we're observing failing mechanism possible situation like exist that's okay appears minor one probably longterm impact
328580,theres longer term gain single player runs risk ongoing votewar needs least majority support though sounds lot like dao explicitly ruled
328583,ignoring reaper raised 10m yearn fork bebis passive aggressive towards andre
328584,yeah i've seen lot since launch aside reaper bs there's ton people super butthurt gist boils free money getting free money come hard get free money
328585,i'm talking mysely cannot speak others
328586,much entitlement
328588,can't escape irony 1 month ago project going launched daniele partnership woo boy would interesting
328589,passive agressive comments hindsight done armchair talk lame read risk losing one important builders space bs conversation point come someone brought system reality gratitude would go long way
328590,hope come passive aggressive
328591,respect bebis
328592,constructive criticism allowed really going lose andre seems bit hyperbolic
328593,nah clue bebis tbh never touched fantom watching sidelines feel bad andre
328594,criticsm guy confused everyone protective seems perfectly capable defending whatever wants
328595,builder space literally everything say used
328596,guys pls wanna understand solidly works 
328597,absolutely suck
328598,real life free speech exists absolute bottom barrel idiots exercise
328599,idea 
328600,i've personally threatened always good time
328601,people get wierd launches best part worst offenders hundred dollars play
328602,nope that's greedy entitled community thinking builders robots make money allowed express discomfort
328605,thats reason devs something meme frustrating devs put heart soul building software entitled people flock expecting make quick buck audacity ask devs something
328606,hopr swiss privacy provider received 1m web3 ecosystem grants backers graph edge node ankr dusk network 
328608,preceeding discussion critiquing mechanism design learn think anyone reading comments able see quite apparently negative feelings towards man whatsoever he's kind newer dev space code incredible getting uni v3 oracles working protocol however also know bebis met irl shared drinks get malicious feel man i'm discussing flaw distribution mechanism i'm trying analyze understand two men respect conflict oneanother answer pretty simple andre anticipate flaw he's assuming worst bm anticipate much value going allocated make plans clear ahead time personal opinion give benefit doubt understand others coming want ultimately think whole thing going turn blip solidly's history rest builders space learn include nondaos considering distribution method future
328609,thought offered reasonable criticism protocol fair got attacked
328610,congrats u finally eat scbuergel
328611,thanks appreciate project quite impressive flaw component distribution mechanic even recoverable people onedge
328612,mostly inoffensive joke started good place like jokes grows popularity space ppl start using different intentions starts change vibe yea
328614,hot take majority community fucking idiotic yes constructive criticism healthy devs need learn longer shipping code hoping works need community managers pr team becoming victim success people care enough shit get angry sign success behind every death threat legitimate concern figure structure protects bullshit noise gives high signal info immunefi dev coms scale match days solo dev done y'all want professionals work like
328615,think there's religion devs gods true y'all magical
328616,behind every death threat legitimate concern lol schizos legitimate concerns whatsoever
328617,behind death threats entitled tard
328618,there's 'victim success burned community increasing expectations soon get bit traction
328619,care enough shit get angry sign success care they're working hard make money
328620,nobody gives shit tec money
328621,thing avoid toxicity audience grows big enough offense andre one things come within way kind social dynamic works going change overnight maybe never however builders try grow better mindset like care nonames twitter think project interact people approach respectfully still enough credit given people
328622,unpopular side want success many users many default entitled dumb often product side effects come unless devs able build fully b2b backend stuff interact devs dev end user side still gets beating sure agree w wrote anymore
328623,idk argue 
328624,oh please builders humans space systemic issue greed independent builders ok every project needs yield maximized profits
328625,sure thing ok small want bigger take side effects thats normal
328626,sure mean
328628,still plain ramen
328629,ser things worked open source ecosystem today especially decentralization first paradigm ownership duties responsibilities liabilities shared even ppl dont let builder peaceful lifewhat refering correct web2 context trying leave behind
328630,can't deal bullshit hire someone protocol takes village stop thinking builders master trades y'all build sometimes make funny memes commmunications degree hire way problem world ain't gonna change
328631,ppl want dao get tokensor ppl want builder start company hire employees pick one
328632,daos hire time many roles fill
328633,i'll point taking andre builders horrible people
328634,let dao hireand stop attacking builder
328635,sorry keep solidly andre intentionally said dao instance
328636,plenty toxic teams grabbing cash disappearing ether gives us bad name responsibility even responsible devs something mentality spread community
328637,also contributes problem people crypto fucked hard various scams cashgrabs excuse behavior explains extent gotten bad every legit builder like 100 scammers cashgrabbers
328639,also consider community 100 people 1% toxic 1 idiot insulting 100k people big 1000 people insulting get vocial minority quickly realistic way fix working mindset never able control actual problem toxic people either accept building lot people
328640,people funded cashgrabs
328641,often willingly
328642,complaints usually come profit like expected
328643,yes that's trust devs much get ripped cylical problem question i'm wondering builders responsibility something bad actors nothing else selfinterest peace mind
328644,often comes reading builder says trying frontrun opportunities ppl can't distinguish dev innovating someone copy pasting projects care finding alpha others
328645,surprised many cashgrabs scams market market knowingly funds like surprised unlikely survive bullet head
328646,whos surprised
328647,reap sow
328648,absolutely control mindset toxic people communities pushing fud contagious combatting team moderators really something needs encouraged user level users happy help shut often empowered knowledge lot cases much transparency could projects well communityteam mods may best communication skills time user can't help know answers either team discuss decisions made provide whyhowetc makes difficult anyone else step shut
328649,problems 1 assume actually block people internet 2 assume people persuaded rational arguments angry 3 even successful 99% people 1% enough ruin builders day community big enough
328650,saying combat toxic behavior never solve problem like trying achieve world peace
328651,rational trying convince making sure everyone else see irrational
328652,hm might right ser dont really agree wrote anymore think charlies reply answers well put burden teams opensource andres case specifically less solans muh funded projects w closed source must come bottom user level
328655,yes agree one rotten apple spoils bunch builders daya bad influence community turns community builder period time ruins builders
328656,need give users balls
328657,basically degen citadel users good
328658,consider generous label trying selfinflicted problem happened chat many times people complain fact getting rekt something nobody forced
328659,even profit driven test help take ownership wo bitching
328660,yeah shadowy super coders scammer coders coder coderwould love see ppl talk community members light well change
328661,dumb pleb users degen ape users dumb whales tech whales
328662,categorize demand side based portfolio size ironic
328663,donkey ass monkey keyboard pleb user needs support
328664,imagine support tickets
328665,also think discouraging idol worship would go long way towards people treating others communitydev relations respect idol worship really promotes toxic attitudes opinions
328666,giving attention cockroaches better ignore devs they're prominent power can't ignore one goes dark path loser screaming death threats mother's basement worth spotlight ban discussing archetypes
328667,examples project using taxed token create legitimate innovative products always shitcoins
328668,cause rek aprs instantly fat ponzi filled wallets
328669,id argue influencers cant even write line code harm nft ecosystem past year builders defi bit less since requires higher level sophistication influence others point builders lot building yes ultimately forces pushes projects mindshare
328670,point instance projects literally created night get nft hard believe long term they'll act appropriately always thought excluded noble thought reward builders time someone gets something free they'll issues
328672,
328674,ok overall cant make users bitch devs ignore keep healthy echochambers efforts praised exercise filter
328676,ask builder ask builder make portfolio grow
328677,i'd add stop worshipping developersleaders
328678,1
328679,require worshippers thinking make amount money least amount work
328680,really would take everyone including devs stop idol worship
328681,except worshipping coming outside
328682,talk community priority person make money
328683,worshipping whipped builders one way street
328684,definitely builders encourage idol worship know exactly i'm talking
328685,danielle builder scammer different
328686,two months ago
328687,y'all mixing builders influencers builders become influencers builders socially awkward
328688,one actively true
328689,andre yearn boys zefram 0xngmi curve autists
328690,takes mix communication skills technical expertise risk tolerance etc yes
328691,lots amazing builders like better know twitter twitter account 100 followers
328692,there's ppl come good idea code well projects idea guy pays team build also there's 100x ppl code enough steal someone else's idea scam ppl
328693,i've thought utility list known sick devs problem comes gets determine impressive good since everything anon easy cheat voting
328694,also requirementstraits corporate dev relevangelist jobs able events etc
328697,constructive conversation
328698,thank
328699,someone spends days reviewing construct code i'd agree w strategic reserve there's selfawareness anticipated obviously lobsters crme de la crme builders sometimes look developers work wonder walk dogs living 
328700,think looksrare guys could prevent wash trading generate merkle tree trading reward claim think
328701,without wash trading get rewards locked staked tokens
328702,1 feature bug
328703,that's bad token holders
328704,majority token holders team early round buyers much
328705,imo way platforms going dethrone opensea start paying creators exclusivity
328706,what's point exclusive noname creator nobody wants buy
328707,said name
328708,nay
328709,pay large creators exclusively launch platform
328710,gaurantee exclusivity can't nft owners list nfts anywhere want
328711,doesnt work like free openweb
328712,btw come nft avenue wrong chat
328713,platform care nft collection care fees generated also yes users go list opensea platforms projects would state they're exclusively listing x bother verifying opensea yes i'll go nft avenue second
328714,
328717,yeah since paid much venft that's bad wait
328719,ladles jellyspoons dapp find staked positions protocols dont provide staked token even possible

329104,based defi enjoyers forwarding novel question fellow degen might know answer
329105,apps simulate much price change increase certain amount eth injected buying tokens
329106,follow question especially change blockchain enter smart contract address simulation
329111,question can't answered without context curve model dex using uniswap v2 answer xyk univ3 depends liq concentration
329112,think question app perform calculation know query chain perform calculation method would depend dex think coingecko lists amount liquidity 2% 2% spread per exchange pair sure delayed accurate tho
329113,good note guess would best account possibilites ie token contract entered app detects chain pick matter dexes trading ie what's situation poolsliquidity based run appropriate price simulation makes sense
329114,yeah along lines
329115,know existing app pretty straight forward code need get reserve tokena tokenb apply amm formula relevant dex need select chain amm might deployed address different evm chain
329116,uniswapv3 might bit complex handle
329117,thanks reply wish level code like vegans steak simple degen wandering defiverse
329119,right bcs differently liq handled
329120,assuming direct hop trade
329121,wow like simply telling users locked cream cancelled snapshot receive 4x less token promised like 10 times less locked 3 4 years joke

329159,donations go brrr
329160,
329161,war much crypto matter unpopular say

329175,nothing joke ukraine make decisions war using snapshotorg holders airdropped nfts
329176,biggest brain move making sure youre polkadot side since whatever therell fewer since fewer users
329177,bigger brain selling assets russia cash bypass personal taxes

329183, oops pvp
329185,parity one think
329186,parity signer
329187,misguided best
329188,thanks
329189,gotta admit i'd feel weird donating
329190,gavin wood beating jihan wu biggest adoption marketing using 5 million dollars
329191,imagine mishandle distribution admin wallet gets exploited defi sillyness becomes big deal
329192,stupid reasons
329193,also looks really really bad
329194,like nft given people farming airdrops offered wartorn country sound like list want
329195,give attention give fake money
329196,well going thru peak attention economy actually ends maximize chance getting donations can't blame moral ethical dilemma remains tho
329197,people farm people lose money wtf hate ukraine
329198,trick get bitcoin lightning working trying fund paywithmoon virtual card bitcoin transactions keep failing
329199,care donations fair enough maybe good idea airdrop dynamicsmetagames simple well known individuals people assume expect governments
329200,idk though general still dont fully grasp idea sending ukraine goverment money people yes goverment continuously gets hundred millions handle begs mill apparently dont money help citizens dont want end political discussion general dont understand goverment airdrop
329201,disagreeing donation efficiency goal maybe best way incentivizing
329202,think many general would agree that's nft drop even one can't find concrete proof going well could something that's getting lost translation help approach donations gamified manner
329203,absolutely hate idea gamifed moralityvirtue would rather lose everything cheese themed scam tokens
329204,iffy there's charity gives little nft badge donating cause like cleaning rivers taking care puppies think there's nothing wrong giving people sense pride accomplishments noted difference government thing especially one that's massively backed major powers
329205,implies value things extrinsically reality can't churches learned early hide wealth reason
329206,yes totally agree badge good ponzu entry token bad began conversation thinking token airdrop rather nft
329207,commemorative art cool
329208,said airdrop assumed nft tbh nothing concrete evidence either nft token even airdrop everyone donated thread confusing
329209,shifts talking polkadot airdrop
329212,even justify ponzi token
329213,decentralised war bond
329214,ohm fork fund war
329216,morality already gamified fabric society visible feels yucky every org incentivises funding shape form
329217,virtue signalled donated org capitulate insight shame
329218,yeah that's get tax benefits charity economic incentives new
329219,even governments

329222,great take

329226,geniunely inspired medal comparison 
329227,kinda neat one eth etfs canada accumulated 30k eth 3 days
329228,bought dip
329229,programatic
329230,redemptions dec ow obvious slope
329231, canonical default signer purpose cannot expect send tokens send tokens connecting chain interacting alternatively use talisman subwallet 
329232,wait parity signer signer damn thought full noncustodial wallet
329233,parity signer largely unmaintained alternative cold wallet separate device stylo 
329234,mobile wallets mathwallet nova polkawallet fearless generally fully fledged metamasklike apps web3 browsers built polkadot side web3 recommend nova
329235,
329236,question signers common code wise minimal safer initiating transactions website seem intuitive lot easier build decent ux tokens automatically added without causing security risk
329237,people lazy used metamask paradigm trying rather terrible signeronly absolutely correct approach
329238,yeah feels like large part mm ux bad tried things
329239,phantom seems slightly better autoadding tokens seems dangerous
329240,website separation concerns could way better job
329241,especially heavily multi chain environment mm nightmare use even 23 active mockeths like matic ava fantom cannot use two apps two chains time without lazy devs deferring everything mm mm going crazy switch network nao warnings
329242,website provide rpc connection editable user functionality expects user interact nothing ask extension signatures
329243,yeah agreed thing site would query networks easy enough summarize everything offer consolidated view
329244, catches lot flak minimal keeps users ridiculously safe
329245,seem struck fine balance minimal yet still shit ux pretty impressive actually
329246,expecting extension wallet everything sending tokens showing nfts dumb expecting dunno oasisapp let send dentacoin context matters specificity matters
329247,true mainly polkadot spaces js api ui extension everything bus factor 1
329248,major security downsides website initiated transactions people get used click sign everything issues
329249,websites delegating signature metamasklike wallet thing signer interpret message show signing thats need
329250,yeah thats thoughts seems like one figured might good reason
329251,api every chains node dotsama standardized exposed via builtin metadata autogeneration theory every message submitted node 100% human readable signer ui risk really
329252,website would also enable address book transaction history thats decent etc
329253,kitchen sink mode extension signer signer use something like singularapp trade mint nfts limit feature set care cross chain balance assets crowdloan statuses raeadable subid site etc work wish ethspace understood rather peppering switch network laziness every new tab open
329254,like unix like philosophy composable singular function components instead monolith jack trades master none

329316,yep probably btw think right bigquery closing tasks bi
329317,well mean google offer free onchain analysis bigquery already load eth data bigquery
329318,use free
329319,another option dune also free lot better imo
329320,yeah issue mostly ethonly atm afaik
329321,think dune offer bsc solana data
329322,checked docs raw data supported eth xdai solana
329323,
329324,story ended
329325,thinking team tokens unlocked smth
329326,celo kinda pivoted whole narrative unbanked defi ponzis tho
329327,cos africa latam play didnt work hard
329328,hard youre team developed country using narratives yea
329329,would 
329330,maybe tokenid number likes
329332,how's book
329335,new spiderbatman gauge town created second largest solid whale guess happens next address shit loads 0xdao tokens relentlessly swapping solid throughout day
329337,good far pulls lot punches infinite machine they're well substantiated see infinite machine suggests things explicitly say eg ming straight manipulated vitalik exec laura's versus camila makes seem like really close friends think laura's version become definitive next yrs consequence need less context understand saying
329338,agree yet quite material details arent disclosed understandable dig deeply origin story know key players tricky story tell
329340,non existing token pair really understand gives obviously earns emissions still lower high volume pool thinkmaybe theres issue think
329342,
329346,roosh's wallet 
329347,address locks 500k solid 4 years it'd get 2% emissions recoups invesment 3 4 weeks think banking profits that's assuming get downvoted
329348,error replacement transaction underpriced
329349,got error metamask couldnt approve tx could somebody help fix 
329350,roosh ct fantomking
329351,gasprice lower current base fee
329352,yes
329353,btw plebs acc fake fyi kul
329355,base fees 140 current 70 gasprice
329356,comparable bm bebis days ago
329357,exact thing
329358,except earned solid fair game guess
329359, find google
329360,dont way fix 
329361,want send etherscan tx dm take look
329363,channel turn solidly support group
329364,dm
329365,looking fresh drama ser
329367,byte mason bebis incentivized tokens pool week emissions
329368,hmm emissions week start hours right last checked lp solidly low good opportunity
329370, fake andre account points wallet griefing roosh friends reaper
329371,fucking scam crowd shitheads
329372,well buy every dip fair 
329373,also seem nearly 9 figures buying ftm bottom 2019 gg
329374,even try
329375,hope dies last
329376,last 9 words blz coiner
329377,
329378,stops theoretically everyone farming non existing tokens apart super stupid come point bribes staking rewards voting dead pools
329379,account could fake address real
329380,antagonistic voting added try prevent downvote pair problem expensive could mean suffer retaliation unless coordinate voters
329381,ye know also super expensive others actually want wake see 100 different non existing pairs getting votes
329382,negative voting supposed prevent small holders large holders supposedly enter scheme defeats protocol purpose fud token
329383,yeah great solid
329384,think oxd sex get top downvote bad actors course could bad acting 1 min epoch change leaving reaction time
329385,maybe folks want see solidly fail 
329386,imo andre followed advice vfat0 negative vote system
329387,might've worked wasnt lot time make changes
329388,week going forward voting okay tonight still issues
329389,think question deridex
329390,vote allocations shown solidly ui ones present week ones upcoming week latter way see vote allocations present week
329391,neither showing current vote allocation moment
329392,votes changed time
329393,change vote last second thursday 0000 utc
329394,votes change anytime bribing make sense
329395,unfortunately
329396,
329397,external bribing systems soonish though
329398,column titled bribes
329399,works flawed
329400,rewards allocated different pools change continually real time snapshot votes sets rewards one week
329401,sounds like snapshot eg
329402,snapshot yes
329403,hm theres snapshot whats problem bribes
329404,bribes continuous 7 days snapshot based snapshot amount solid rewards also continuously emitted 7 days
329405,total amount solid rewards next week determined via snapshot gauges aim stream solid rewards different pools moved around continuous basis
329406,amount solid rewards per block specific pool change block
329407,gauge's allocation week determined snapshot right midnight feel free dm pollute chat
329409,3
329411,4 
329412,actually nvm ivan right 
329413,fast smart pleb

329424,anyone tell curve quoting formula solidly code
329425,observing strange behavior solidly stable pools im wondering due formula
329427,another brain teaser 
329429,wasnt bug bounty immunifi
329430,that's negative moment 
329431,really like type documentation let see last updated amount gitbooks i've seen bug bounty audit soon last updated 6 months ago 
329432,good metric measure intention vs outcome
329433,think switch gitbook options shows last updated x docs
329434,see thank
329435,thank king

329489,people concerned much usdc reliance crypto
329490,people probably bull market everyone concerned numba going really interesting things like decentralization focus people
329491,linked real usd dont think big problem
329492,yeah guess could seen much attention yet
329493,problem see financial censorship we've seen past week could honestly see usdc censoring governments pressure everyone swift kick entire country hard would pressure usdc people blacklist crucial defi smart contract seems like defi setting resilient
329495,coming regulated industry exposure aml fatf etc suspect usdc model likely template us compliant stablecoins going forward
329498,agree discord weeks talked medici bit imho main product protocol abacus spot like sort nftbased liquidity pool arbitrage think worth read bit interested nft price appraisal sybil attack cryptopunk appraisal session interesting read case study nft liquidity abacus spot thingie nft legos use one abacus products provide pricing nft lending protocols example instead using floor price

329586,best bear mkt
329587,
329589,every time look privacy metamask find another annoying surprise hope anons frens infura jp morgan guess 
329590,would cool see testnet separate page
329591,goes frame
329592,frame new metamask support
329593,test frame yet good idea
329594,delighted happened donate right reasons toxic airdrop hunters 
329596,much hate say worked look much got
329597,good idea great one imo
329598,coordination incentives understand
329599,good idea incentivizing
329600,news ita large brazilian bank today fucked balance ledger clients balance gone clients balance increased speak trying handle
329601,makes everyone actually donated look silly
329602,talking politics dont see whats happening around us guess point trying explain
329603,also ironic given recent solidly events also something make drama let
329604,fundraising speculators survive attack country legit imo
329605,apes got farmed fun cant argue cause justified case funds spent well argue words happy get airdrop trying help people dying cant win farmed sheep saying sheep expect anything back nothing changed terms cause u sought
329606,pity people got separated money got deserved know rarely case mean think person separation sane
329607,get ask 
329608,ye thats basically indeed justification work terrible horrible situation even rug would
329609,think ethically questionable another day crypto
329610,tbh donated assumed airdrop would nft
329613,get banned low iq
329614, redacted questions sowwy
329615,bro
329616,go request ur data consensys
329617,sent fookin 3 gigabytes
329618,really got proof consensys logging rpc requests 3gb
329619,fucking god damn lawyers non disclosure agreement
329620,
329621,request metamask makes infura 
329622,
329623,ur proof
329624,
329625,numbers rise infura 15000 registered developers serving 6 billion api requests per day transferring roughly 16 petabytes data per month says cocchiaro 2017 alone relayed transactions moved 7 million ether almost 9 million far 2018 growth happened second half 2017
329626,relayed transactions moved 7 million ether almost 9 million far 2018
329627,u know value transaction without recording
329628,anyone knows way get 500 ropsten eth
329629,hahahahaha
329630,fyi getblockwallet issues well sir
329631,way simple changing rpc provider metamask several issues within make hard decouple using metamask reconsturcting user
329632,eg metamask use etherscan network etherscan supports verify rpc provider reported state etherscan
329633,really wallet problem need query balances need onchain data metamask could evolve disable balance checksallow reroute balance gas calculation node choice end day issues upstream
329634,sauce please
329635,another example metamask pings gas service provider via codefi gas pricing information
329636,another example metaswaps knows trades etc welll attempted trades
329637,metamask knows went swap something cancelled
329638,want wallet attempt make transactions without kind checks sufficient balance gas fee correct end burning eth transactions fail moaning instead
329639,metamask knows kind porn u like
329640,fml
329641,every stage process leaks info
329642,isp knows
329643,infura knows
329644,metamask knows
329645,whats even worse
329646,metamask's publishing account get compromised malicous version metamask make chrome's extenstion store update automatically downloaded every chrome user updated
329647,seamlessly
329648,automatically chromes default behavior
329649,gm
329650,oof
329651,wen selfbuildable extension source
329652,hey guys dont worry ethsign getting depreciated safe use users lel
329653,check ita twitter account storm ppl tweeting accounts social media manager trying control mess
329654,think they're frontrunning users way flashboys iex
329655,process fully automated would assume instantly published eg big extensions upload update sort delay review
329656,review looks good next relevant 
329657,yeah nothing new use peoples infrastructure know stuff
329658,yes i'm aware bunch privacy issues mm also querying jpgs pretty annoying ux usually long way go proper privacy nation states entered arena better catch quickly though
329659,another quick question solidly staked solid thought would reward snapshot share change idea
329660,
329661,better checkmate zuk family
329662,finally honest take
329663,bro
329664,yes
329665,worries sir chrome extensions using manifest v2 obsolete january 2024
329666,oh shit mean 2023
329668,
329669,ruggggggggged
329670,looks like sifu
329671,clear metamask requires v2 cause handle priv keys think using agoric ses aka realms
329673,
329674,considering rekts serious adblocker ubo brave end users
329675,thanks sharing send cookies use local rpc still send analytics via means txs current block checking comm
329676,order books soon
329677,
329678,1inch already order book p2p like step toward fiat onramp imo
329679,beastlyorion retweeted metamask blocked ethereum transactions venezuela citing compliance laws 
329680,little known problem also happening extent countries hneed switch mobile networks connect web3 websites sea there's issue europe 
329681,kinda interesting api key'ing data siphoning means block even vpn
329682,think anything metamask though probably depends rpc used website
329683,maybe block regions 
329685,ok say happens ok specific web3 apps atm cambodia
329686,happen selfcompiled metamask instances
329687,well assume geospoofing solve antidetect system eg lstenebriscc good proxies 911re idk continue using
329688,see even time zone browser check pixelscannet fvision
329689,let's see long going take extend russia etc
329690,using metamask i'd surprised userbase even dented 001%
329691,
329692,good tweet summary os new wallet vpn mm custom network rpc glad default infura thing crazy spy job mm tracking ip addresses somehow
329693,closer thought geographically vietnam
329694,wen metamask fork default rpc decentralized infura already exists token sustain network
329695,affected means they've paired real ip address consensys bothered need vpn
329696,fair imagine consensys 1 minimum required law 2 enough headaches switzerland situation
329697,russia using vpns living expect affected
329698, solution get everyone away infura know much details saw ethdenver
329699,start censoring become relevant enough pressured
329700,decentralized rpc provider yes would think
329701,youre connecting one centralized provider network nodes recall correctly
329702,also run node proxy mode think would bulletproof solution
329703,really dont understand people run nodes
329704,incredibly simple much effort
329705,easy cheap run something need submit txs interact network need archive queries etc centralized anyway centralized layers like graph etc
329706,easier install metamask
329707,still effort using someone elses node people unless situation forces thats things work
329708,literally downloading image onto small computer plugging 12w even solar panel least selling presynced
329709,yes point strong deterrent pretty sure people countries less voice say northern countries
329710,lost 99% people image
329711,install picture run transactions insert math meme
329712,sure like said selling presynced services still 500 really much pay 100% availability worlds uncensorable database
329713,average person yes
329714,literally plug play via stuff like avado whatever things called took stuff whitelabeled
329715,yes
329716,refuse believe world avg eth tx 100 use eth 500 lifetime access
329717,disconnected average crypto user mean us running node
329718,quite disconnected also wondering yes
329719,might interested look play around fun requirements good link get started
329720,they're willing pay make money they're willing make effort
329721,
329722,wouldnt even paid
329723,avg user give shiz decentralization wan make
329724,avg user also technical
329725,even willing make effort kinda like onchain voting visibly worth
329726,took avg user fully figure metamask
329727,well dunno maybe wrong camp livelihood depends metamask infura centralized eth infra much actually hurts finally fuck spending week learn basics list backuo rpc nodes text file mean seems like pretty good investment 
329728,easy clicking download waiting 5 minutes pressing icon nothing else yeah probably changes
329729,sure react need metamask good enuff
329730,sync b c nah
329731,leave tool migrating rn sweeposauruscom
329732,hi anybody know metamask alternative
329733,frame
329734,apparently talked already
329735, several great alternatives mentioned also check linked defiprime list op post
329736,private run node would one txs depending host make identifiable
329737,thank
329738,run nodes proxy
329739,think stuff configurable within chosen client
329740,mostly adds moving parts maintain upgrade time civilian use probably overkilled error prone
329741, also
329742,kinda like companies dont run servers anymore
329743,running nodes multiple chains fault tolerant way big extra work
329744,good option market rpc providers
329745,think choice important thing
329746,nobody hosts stuff anymore culture people things definitely disappeared years
329747,true look said
329748,pokt least incentivizes people run nodes otherwise hard get people rpc providers generally plug play
329749,yeah multiple providers relaively low risk different legal spaces
329750,infura bad
329751, alchemy even walkthrough using lieu infura
329752,us derisking compliance
329753,long metamask bundled might hard get people move
329754,ahem api key identifies ways similar infura
329755,example another provider making infura offramp guide
329756,better decentralization people running nodes best nonus entities make easy switch may also make dent
329757,options best place hide tree forest
329759,wen ur first mention techcrunch smh
329760,lmfaooo
329761,win 
329763,tbt 0xchad
329764,sorry child charlieeth call us daddy
329765,thing multisig instead needing majority participants sign doesnt execute 24 hours allows member veto execution instead signed
329766,ah yes optimistic governance whatever called vshvsh u implemented someone else forgot
329767,ive seen lot people complaining tiresome getting participants sign lot time feels like makes sense
329768,ivangbi
329769,know 1 2 projects work advanced governance policies social recovery think much needed simple multisig isnt functional daos accessexecution rights granular prod afaik though
329770,exactly thinking process joke like calling cleaner executive health maintaince officer
329771,new name tag u blz
329772,one suggest toolservice try using combination gnosis special services like safientio youll find better solution please reply message sir3
329773,narrative bldr
329774,link main defi chat group
329775,troll ouch ser main one 
329776,yep implementation made lido called easy track tailored dao aragon currently im aware module use something similar like gnosis safe would awesome
329777,brutal customer review
329779,proud
329781,gnosis safe tx guards could utilized tbh seen action personally 
329782,
329783,based st lucia us jurisdiction issues 
329784,tx wont arbitraged unless using sushiswap frontend incase wondering uses different endpoint
329785,hate current web3 
329787,wen web11
329788,reminder pancakeswap start geoblocking users 10 countries march 9
329789,wow really source please
329790, articles well wonder managed quietly noone noticed
329791,fuckers make sure dump every bnb farm
329792,free crypto world collapsing sad
329793,list crypto platforms avoid since started geofencing users regularly update list metamaskinfura opensea pancakeswap
329794,tbf could come something like block frontend legal policy alternative frontend made community members that's fucking
329795,cuba sudan democratic republic congo zimbabwe belarus syria iraq crimea belarus i'm going guess one mentions belarus meant russia edit article writer include north korea iran poorly written article screenshot lists countries
329798,banned name russia guess
329799,avoid metamask sister
329800,good question
329801,liquity really good example there's many different front ends makes censorship resistant
329802,guess avoid infura that's still main wallet kinda retarded main wallet since 2016 lol
329803,see use search helpful
329804,still offers bad user experience
329805,yes job project team educate community
329806,frontend solutions important
329807,
329808,show single tweet even warned users
329809,thanks ill read use 10 different wallets still need dig deeper figure one best main alternative mm get rpc part
329810,yup warning world see 
329817,admin ban
329818,maybe use brave privacy browser chromium ethereum wallet included add custom rpc i've using pokt network rpc week gone yet
329819,brave tracks model advertising
329820,disable
329821,dont like idea wallet embedded within browser
329822,coinbase wallet nice browser extension qr code scan ur phone
329823,use coinbase exchange
329824,whenever u want sign tx u scan ur phone opposed computer
329827,yeah drawback looking get away mm kill 2 birds one stone config
329828,that's actually pretty nice i've avoided coinbase i'm distrustful trust decent mobile browser shit piloting imtoken browser far good
329829,throw 1inch dydx
329832,heard devs hard times implementing software coinbase wallet
329836,entirely reworked sdk walletlink coinbasesdk last week
329837,easier work
329838,mean even retarded move pretty much opposide effect anyone know handshake block way whats userfriendly yet uncensored way use ens name regular plebs ens gateway thing technically like cares decentrazlied web3 domain name web2 gateway block based nationality
329839,crazy namecheap recently buying namebase wonder future handshake domains affected
329840,
329841,anyone duna analytics block usdc addresse volume calced usdt 350m ethereum alone excluding sidechains 5% usdt seized
329842,omg geo blocking lets avoid bit weird narrative past defi year geo blocking making sign disclaimer w ur wallet thing long time gradually projects open source uis could even circumvent run dont force ip blocking letting soft consent random disclaimers also cant openly say hey go use illegal frontend obviously bit brains research fundamentally different lower level infura rest holds 
329843,virtue signalling best
329844,ser think bad diminishing importance problem would real trouble millions people right alone close hundred requests acquaintances buy stablecoin russia keep securely imagine many technically uneducated newcomers joining stablecoin marketing right people last week even know word solution think important split wallets two categories one gives easy way around avoid geo blocking one matemask browser plugin mobile app simple settings edit rpc addresses easy put new one trust wallet hand
329845,flashbots rpc good
329846,things supposed
329847,dont know set give try
329848,
329849,sure seems fair meant context defi complex solutions id expect users brains context really retail ye likely us friendly stuff also made opportunity anyway disagreeing per se
329850,blankwallet provide solution dig privacy i'd like believe covers edge cases
329851,
329852,past issue
329854,stuck tx fix one kinda inconvenient aside api sushirelay comv1 suggested noncensored rpcs regular users
329855,question really people flock 'decentralized' solution like looks never quite understood fascination os anyway mosteveryone able circumvent using nft agregators geniegem
329856,looks decentralized way though airdropped tokens make decentralized especially hold big share tokens
329857,jurisdiction sense team anon legal entity behind coerce
329859,default powerful primitive ser opensea people get introduced nfts
329860,sryyyyy addmin
329861,didnt read definition way
329862,ethermineorg
329863,sushirelay connects however flashbots endpoint ur tx night get rejected
329864,what's best dex agg mev protected trades charges fees tokensnot eth 
329865,sushirelay also services frontend sushiswap exposes necessary rpc methods dapp function
329866,gasless trading
329867,yes already using cowswap need alternative
329868,setup
329870,matcha offers certain pairs
329871,certain amounts forget
329872,sushi router upgrade feature deployed yet
329873,couldnt use flashbot rpc matcha1inchparaswap
329874,gasless
329875,also cowswap exactly asking bids
329876,blocked usdt isnt sanctions malware hacks
329877,true matcha use wethover 5k gassless pairs
329878,hmm there's good alternative cowswap atm
329879,vouch 500 wallets dont think matter time would based nationality political bs imho money shouldnt controll goverments sort decentralized universal thing like water big influenced individual goverments
329880,yes
329881,ofac list banned addresses 21 eth addresses
329882,fincen yet request blocking usdt think sure
329884,
329885,usdt banned addeess
329886,oh right sorry since usdt hasnt banned sanction list yet means would never happen risk whatsoever apology shortsighted didnt claim banned based political reasons yet wrote 350m assets seized matter seconds current trend even wallets dex etc restricted access based regulator requests matter time centralized stablecoins follow
329887,built 
329891,thanks really appreaciate 24m ethereum thoughts 12x lower usdt 
329892,idea sure methods banning used topic blacklisted called usdc blacklister calls 25 addresses eth 
329894,use fwiw
329895,major issues hanging txs anything that's worried
329896, anyone know want know actual implementation
329898,probably defi exploiters early days cashed usdt team fast freezing youre really interested id suggest research much frozen usdt frozen hackers
329899,evmos airdrop evm compatible chain cosmos already claimable looks like issues though frontend claim 50% evmos drop voting government proposal staking tokens 1 go community frontend feel free double check official evmos discord 2 connect metamask 3 navigate governance airdrop claim mission vote 4 go back main dashboard received 25% airdrop 5 need stake get another 25% airdrop 6 running validator preferred validator i'd happy could stake us dankuzone w daic staked 25% dashboard available
329900,understand point limited geofencing due securities issue censuring smart contract pairs securities frontend happening wide implications greatly affects ordinary users example opensea centralized platform prepared like theyve blocked iranian russian artists buyers one day block chinese indian govt says hints like blocking whole countries may go individuals well blocking seizing talking war may situations like divorce investigation ppl unaware proximity tainted coins etc crypto world split two soon hope wake developers blue chip projects start thinking best practices comes frontends decentralizing governance code updates asap ethereum community decide impose infra default platforms work improving decentralized infrastructure seems prepared development different parts web3 puzzle going hand hand
329901,totally true open source uis open source everything make users learn start experiencing issues natural indeed always private side industry fully public compliant one
329902,stats usdcusdt bans 
329903,applicable metamask since keplr fails vote right
329904,think keplr part need send receive ibc transaction get 25% airdrop fe switching osmosis keplr create new ibc transfer channel204 osmosis token send 00x osmo evmos unlock 25% airdrop keplr
329905,official claiming page still broken 
329907,hey degens platform works like manager present idea ie btcatom 3x long user deposit fund vault manager trading strategyprompted position closed divides rewards
329908,exactly want social trading
329909,done w gearbox fi u wanna build get lemme know
329910,otherwise indexes handle somewhat sure optimized
329911,passive really social trading sure fit
329912,theres project called trading strategy aims something similar wont live late 2022 probably
329913,basically yearn active strats
329914,anyone else still using ambire wallet imo best stable yield right around 2425% hold lobster drawback get paid token
329915,worked thanks cannot find ibc transfer button go keplr settings switch
329916,wow lol waste tons claiming
329917,would building strategies work gearbox exploring use cases team top tradfi quants profitable strats
329918,done differently could maybe suggest concrete one
329919,cool eth denver talk guessing similar auth3's metamirror product offchain data stored computed parcel privacypreserving blockchain storage computation infrastructure developed oasis labs
329920,sure example 1 basis trade 2 longonly basket hedged exposures possible
329921,kind like dhedge dhegde subscribe existing fund managers get see manage positions transparently
329922,yeah dhedge still supporting perp
329923,last time gas low
329924,probably enzymefinance submitting feature request
329925,
329926,see thanks answers
329927,thanks question gearbox developing strategies simple 1 write strategy example want short eth invest usdc yearn could something provide 1 eth get x4 leverage 4eth swap 4eth 12k usdc deposit 12k usdc yearn 2 steps using gearbox interface 3 you''re interested implement programmatic gearbox adapters special smart contacts programming interface original contacts wanna use example uniswap v3 yearn solidity pseudo code would something like creditmanageropencreditaccount1eth x4 get 4eth univ2adapterswapexacttokensfortokens4eth get 12k usdc yearnadapterdeposit12k usdc deposit usdc yusdc pls connect dev chat discord need help
329928,oxmikko sweet thanks follow later
329929,
329930,interesting
329931,perprelated strategies also possible via gearbox basis trading someone mentioned
329932,mean whitelisting perpetual protocol instance strats smth else yes technically possible requires oracle work
329933,yet integrations go brr soon maybe within couple months
329934,oh thanks u know perps dydx wont possible far know
329935,probably impossible ye hard tech wise oxmikko correct wrong
329936,keplr work ledger instance
329937,im like read explained opinion im avoiding attitude chosen simply inform users even tweet geoblocking educate community way project team anonymously create frontend position
329938,perpetual protocol work tongnk yes
329939,interesting subject call anonduplicates geofenced frontends know legit phishing fronts maybe start brainstorming need duplicatefronts asap
329940,core trusted members audit release os version compare changes anyone makes wanna run locally hash ok ui crosscheck source code
329941,oxmikko ur idea forget
329942,going full monty 
329943,thats exactly opinon project team come solution believe something called decentralized
329944,stand
329945,would possible transfer collateral optimism
329946,would anon manner maybe giving hint core community least spread know
329947,yea composable 
329948,info ser alpha
329949,could intro team pls
329950, public resources
329951,basically vault contracts somewhat similar gearbox credit accounts run oracles
329952,ser dont make gearbox
329953,interdasting
329954,plans gearbox support zk rollups future
329955,want talk ask around
329956,dont like
329957,interesting trading real dogshit tokens
329959,profit ser 
329961,drawdown risks worth profits
329963,dont think theyre trading api demonstration existing product
329964,stop share fake twitter
329965,relax
329966,makes sense thanks explanation
329967,theyve started jupyter toolkit algotrading basically
329968,wish knew means haha
329969, think theyre using vaults
329970,geofencing usually done frontend layer simply cloning frontend code expecting able connect backend serversservices upon deployment unlikely work perhaps solution could found server configurations route connections predefined array proxies based nongeofenced territories
329973,guys i'm sorry offtopic much communities ask frien ukraine helping innocent people survive asked donate money card number can't transfer anything unfortunately due stupid sanctions seems anyone solution problem please shoot dm
329975,transfer money ukraine sanctions againts russian russian banks

330007,thanks david
330009,hope possible web3 adaptive strategies able crowdsourced adopted im somehow skeptical magic bullets active portfolio management remains biggest sector cashgrab retail forex market like pamm trading portfolio bots bots marketplaces doesnt work scam cashgrab make even attractive projects using ai narratives like ai generate u profit everyday reality doesnt work
330010,erigon otterscan still best experience ethereum
330011,akula otterscan soon
330012,yes hft hedge funds using ai models algos portfolio management active algo trading experience adaptive models tuning basic strategy mostly stupid arbitragepricing even thing working models trainingtesting selection every day based freshed data btw even approach 100% loosing money blackswans please share opposite experience algorithmic trading crowdsourced strategies
330013,yes sir excited akula
330015,like alternative blockscan
330016,depends much theyve lost drawdowns wouldnt expect guys outperform holding eth much since textbook strats public claim even 23% yield top respectable long term
330018,cool doc send corithebee
330019,oops
330020,btw 2tb ssd enough erigon archive node
330021,recommend 3 think
330023,2 tb might enough couple weeks wont long
330024,would merge reduce fees tho
330025,dont forget merge wont really noticeable effect throughputgas fees
330027,eh people tend demominate gas fees usd eth price goes gas price gwei go assuming constant demand
330028,im frantically trying think transactions gas sub 30 gwei though lol
330030,yeah cross mind maybe buy dozen
330031,wish derivatives based gas
330032,require lot computations hence oiler w starky stuff
330033,used gas tokens abused selfdestruct opcode
330035,tkstanczak shed light releases wants idk
330036,sure still exists
330039,kinda fair waste space haha
330040,couldve renamed sudoku smh
330043,damn starky plonky stuff definitely interested learning projects space
330044,eth needs borrowchecker instead selfdestruct p
330045,yam monthly gas options uma sure current situation
330048,big brain
330049,comprehensive updated website showing lending stacking pooling %apr chains something like eth ethereum aave certain apr ecc fantom tarot impermax etc
330050,idk accurate coindixcom
330051,
330052,migrate users new vlcvx contract currently locked cvx unlocked old contract anyone votelocked cvx withdraw tokens lock cvx page relock new contract
330053,
330054,nice thanks subscribed already
330055,hope helpful 
330056,thought dev inculator ahahah joke aside congrats guys
330057,
330058,hey acd today discussed proscons postmerge mapping latest json rpc keyword safe head block 4 sec delay dont expect reorged normal network conditions instead absolute latest block providing extra security default options would available question default curious folks think
330059,mean safe head rpc latency devs still option use existing rpc get deprecated 
330060,safe head would return older block current block enough attestations deemed safe rpc keep supporting latest time question whether map latest safe block actual tip chain also expose directly via eg new unsafe flag
330061,near blockchain finality property exactly reason 
330062,saving click
330063,yes finalized
330064,happens every 12 minutes something swap latest
330065,seems like multichainxyz stop service open source though
330066,wdym
330068,chainlist
330069,question happened tokens
330070,thats anyswapmulti think
330071,oh thought anyswap
330072,hey anybody hearing convex exploit
330073,i'm hearing rumors tokens unlocked
330074,
330075,due sanctions expect increase non centralised stables like dai people worried usdt usdc blocking
330076,that's interesting composition supposed safe 
330077,considering voted usdc friends happens they're compelled comply
330078,
330079,think impossible block dai like blocking ethereum network country
330080,famous last words
330081,blocking needs happen blocking addresses whether fiatcoins dai
330082,protocol needs redeployed want modify dai way
330083,aside ust anything else truly decentralized well ust decentralized centralized control terra co
330084,reflexer frax
330085,lusd
330086,lusd
330087,decentralized
330088,even ui decentralized
330089,u anyone else successfully voted claimed staked via metamask confirm safe metamask warning potential threat try voting
330090,personally worked
330091,think warns sign message right
330092,also dashboard keplr running think
330093,pretty shitty uiux though case looking validator destination shameless shill evmosvaloper1teve9jdzedzu64mty72qc2888kh7t9hjchp5y2
330094,frax backed 80% usdc
330095,dai token yeah save approval shenanigans that's unlikely change going forward need redeploy everything
330097,answer ppl saying maker gonna implement kyc can't done current system 
330098,biggest problem makerdai usdc collateral frozen otherwise see weak points
330099,yes even manageable fud tiresome
330100,agreed maker getting way much shit people clue especially ust mim people insufferable
330101,2 3 
330102,ppl easily influenced love holding torches pitchforks brownie points independent thinkers
330103,seems optimistic mkr holders stopping vote given token even concentrated comp color sceptical
330104,suggest bit optimism general course maker crash burn silver bullets better start understanding collateral damage cause across ecosystem wanna side history
330105,perhaps matters like say lusd best better eliminate extent possible leverage compellors might hope different time
330106,one comparing things though merrier working towards common goals winner takes
330107,stop hatin geez
330108,migrating locking contract discovering vulnerability exploited
330109,ahh makes sense
330110,funds risk announcement
330111,
330112, someone blacklist maker usdc
330114,what's opinion rai safe way go stable fully decentralized
330115,thread happening today 
330116,rai also legit
330117,goes lusd rai others fwiw believe either scalable reasons rai explains docs
330118,1
330119,ampleforth introduce smth new recently
330120,since forth happened better even usdc i'm still much favor mechanism behind much project
330121,yeah ampl best pricing future trade roughly 1 can't really held safely across days holdings value % market cap
330122,
330123,oef seems savage
330125,hey guys anyone got info might psyops take fud
330126,liked post better cool new eip allows lower storage costs 
330127,ctrlf earlier tweets ser anyway maybe tired wants plebs fuck loves psyops let
330128,
330129,please check 100% info 
330130,reposting original post cause cooler damn neat gonna save lot gas
330131,space sucks sometimes
330132,yh think leave alone like hes probably reading lol
330133,idk fantom solidly andre decentralized project one developer leaving
330134,discuss work man
330135,fucking really i'll stop posting since repost sorry sir
330136,people like andre make goodcompetitive project outstanding one time
330137,never said thats tweet agree fantom bigger andre although probably reason started gain big traction honest
330138,think chain working bullrun
330139,start real traction andre started tweeting spooky spirit release deployment yearn followed dex aggregators etc
330140,idk much value adds tho discussing go much tbh
330141,lot liquidity migrating fantom solidly agree fantom working hard think two reasons mutually exclusive think reasons made fantom gain lot traction
330142,well andre since beginning move year ago along every chain 3 years flat
330143,
330144,go back year look avax bsc ftm matic went nuts january 2021 apart
330146,saw seems regulators coming hard
330147,404
330148,mean medium article go tweet click medium link dunno telegram cut link

330164,kind table
330165,anyone know people defiprime seems cite curation mirror without credit
330168,believe coincide
330171, hm actually thought automated posting mirror based views something like
330172,stay safe banteg
330173,mirror provide public view data neither browser that's create curator dao select excellent articles crawler
330174,crawling scraping data mirror violating tos
330175,arweave contents stored
330176,thanks credit dear defi prime team

330180,
330181,otterscan work erigondevel branch bsc intend support work right dont say 100% sure im still process syncing bsc node much bigger mainnet
330182,fwiw many etherscans features fictions stuff like 'internal txns' actually part spec
330183,dont need archive data block 1 enable pruning mine set 1 yr ago using 1tb
330184,though iirc enable pruning can't decrease number blocks keep
330185,yes good note think changing pruning config require fresh sync
330188,internal transactions traces
330190,since beginning
330191,curious question keeper functions protocols trade assets yearn harvests selling rewards underlying prevents keepers sandwiching trade keepers rug pool harvest
330192,kind would need scrap website can't sort coin
330193,mean use 'search symbols' filter need
330194,solidity dev help reducing gas contract short one dm please thanks 
330195,response extraordinary events following russias invasion ukraine united states united kingdom imposed expansive economic sanctions designed hold russia accountable comply circle temporarily disabling fiat payments accounts located russia including card payments cards issued russia may impact business apologize inconvenience 
330196,next step freeze usdc suspicious accounts 
330197,potentially becomes kyc move usdc
330198,would even implement
330199,well would see worst case scenario would complex around contracts maybe initially freezing eoa funds pending kyc possibly contracts would need kyc controlling company dox founders problem would pretty much destroy usdc basically self destructing control gov probably hardcore certainly possible
330200,complexity probably lies around bridged assets side chains l2s liquid derivative assets like ausdc ya unlikely possible blanket approach without causing major trouble non sanctioned us entities
330201,hard stay 1 theres technical possibility mechanics blacklisting actively used analyze showed 2 clear trend regulation everything thats possible 3 fiat money regulated af
330202,solidity telegram chats one ask questions
330203,
330205,thanks ruffr1d3r
330207,worries
330208,
330213,mguan326 also check loads cool stuff 
330215,wonder solution unrekt evmos rektdrop use ledger pretty awful launch following eligible receive evmos airdrop keys created ledger hardware wallet cannot claim diluted heavily current staking apr around 6000% one would think issue would tested prior launch current fix progress seems also issue ledger metamask may work around major issue ledger keplr
330216,general says claim coming soon
330217,think official claim dashboard even yet begs question launch activate inflation delayed launch avoid kind stuff happening absolute fuckup
330218,getting dilluted stake sorry noob q
330219,even claim without ledger
330220,course 200m circ tokens launch majority unclaimable current inflation 750k per day
330221,dashboards built validators could manually
330223,metamask seems work anyone know legit mm warns signature
330224,yes legit
330225,yep used hrs ago good
330226,might find entertaining 
330227,
330228,synthetix assets getting volumes based tweet whats catalyst
330229,whats story kp3r closing
330230,maybe need synthetix assets buy synthetix stocks
330232,oh andre maintainer
330233,source u close ui maybe shutting saying doesnt mean protocol stops
330234,working onchain yes fine
330235,devs dont really use uis anyway
330236,fair
330237,

330242,ipfs theres 
330243,wait fixed forex keeper network
330244,funny people asking etherscan censor spoof erc20 transfers follow spec internal transactions view created years ago helps users see eth transfers sent contact interactions
330246,defi building sers i'm happy report i'm bali good much spiritual many healthy see people extending lobsterdao meatspace gathering together dubai move rent cool villa mansion together depends many lobsters cool stuff prepared info coliving generation event works would cool lobsterhouses around globe 
330247,dm examples censored tokens generally fake brand infringement cases get helps protect users
330248,better lobsterdao chat ser good hear u r safu personally would never thing cause sounds like bad opsec idk discussion continue lobsterdao chat
330249,also shows claim rektdrop coming soon anyone knows claim
330252,
330253,i've never heard bacon protocol
330257,old website kp3r already new one new one
330259,perfect example
330260,thedao token censored everywhere
330261,case able search tokens select tokens search bar dropdown tokens gone minimal verification team come results default people like complain censorship get scammed blame us supporting scammers 
330262,yes dao uniswap metamask etc banned
330263,ser 
330264,didnt say etherscan
330265,said uniswap metamask etc
330266,ah replied replying question etherscan
330267,yes
330268,level censorship desirable
330269,malicious pathological tokens
330270,tbh experience complain censorship often havent thought considerations scams decency
330271,censorship wedge take away freedoms instead censorship us common decency
330272,whaaaat
330273,true
330274,may find token like porn token offensive example one going censor want people free even leads destruction people also practice self control patience others see world
330275,understand debate cant people say others complain isnt enough censorship reality often nuanced debate telegram twitter achieve 
330277,oh yeah also search tokens search bar top tokens page eg feel free complete exact word 
330278,anyone experienced error 500 gnosis safe trying access wouldnt load balance balance looks fine etherscan cant initiate transaction website directly

330380,nice idea ivangbi
330381,isnt andre always wanted build dex one maintains
330382,indeed take either abuse nah build
330383,sounds good theory even though always good marketer 247
330384,speculating anything like decision shut shutting probably 1 hour work delegate everything etc continuous likely relation even
330385,well ye daos need take sushi nobody yet
330387,sorry posted didnt see

330391,sushi strong internal backlash one internal begin
330392,ask print promise things something
330393,possible
330394,imo regulation deepen less less people probably would want responsible
330395,good luck us 
330396,nobody stops u anon
330397,would think
330398,sure anon users dealt regulation comes across board would protocolcompany would let remain anon
330400,ser protocol kyc u insert onchain already web 2 company statements make sense sorry couch legal
330401,issue could ur personal bank source funds always solveable
330402,soon see shift blocking funds nationalising funds meaning steal youll remember words
330403,politics aside cant argue everybody finance world given high degree blocking subjectivity becoming really inside oh well
330404,kp3ryearn already teams running less relevant regards frontends etc
330405,hopefully andre ok
330406,sucks see hope andre ok
330407,ye kp3r big chunk promises barely something live surly gonna okay
330408,bunny said
330409,
330410,fantom eco good yfi revenue though right
330411, dev something community thinks wagmi dev something community realizes ngmi blames dev dev burns trying something community throws rocks dev eventually quits community throws rocks dev quits cant nice things
330412,one issues see projects person oriented instead project lot communications projects happen personal twitter handlers gets fragile
330417,community bad dev good
330418,crazy every cycle dev burns trying something happens time token unlocks bear markets
330419,plebs aped project blaming devs deserve kek
330421,even supposed get burned
330422,mean speculators starts going dev's head ceases making unhealthy environment continue building
330423,probably community gets super toxic around times
330424,fact people conviction space willing push huge fiat pay
330425,saying see every years
330426,please discussion happened earlier week following
330427,community throws rocks dev quits stage can't stop
330428,must looking closely
330431,bullish devs continue building tough times 
330432,solid test version old deriswap right 
330433,bullish stupid comments
330435,andre continued building 201819
330436,reviewing projects working ftmyfi etc
330437,
330438,look wall street emotions chart might find better explanation communities behave around devs
330439,goldfish memory correct i'm wrong working yfi 2018 right surely
330440,1819
330441,said 17
330442,realize worked things right
330443,need excessively moralise lol crypto potential make loads money paired toxic conditions things go well
330444,honest find good wishes andre chats people understandably pissed price action
330445,guess see things differently one spot even majority messages positive weigh enough
330446,across twitter even resentment seems stop crazy watch tbh
330447,there's whole lot see flung devs private unfortunate amount expectationentitlement people especially become belligerent adds people want deal
330448,developerdao
330449,perhaps taken note andres medium post smart contracts
330450,reason devs stay anon
330451,damned damned dont
330452,satoshi gonna rug moment
330453,skeletoninachairjpg
330454,ok enough memezes good point raised ggwp
330455,bear market starts significant pressure increases devs waiting someone take solidy im sure itll live yearn already stable without andre
330456,solidex posted sure accurate
330457,
330458,guess mean projects self sustainable brilliant problem see number contributions everywhere right generally going rapidly sad many people abandon space market conditions bad saying that's andre leaving idea 100% general trend
330463,said andre decided closing chapter contibuting deficrypto space
330465,thats true good builders continue build bull theres lot contributions forkers people trying cashgrab dont feel innovation necessarily much bull
330467,think really dependent though even good innovation one want participate makes use also toptier development toptier teams eitherways
330469,haha sad seems taken care already 
330472,redacted sub project different chain different protocol really space lobsters discuss much know em farm love em ur thing done
330473,want share something building startups concept perhaps happened best defi industry 
330475,
330476,fact people twitter saying rugged blows mind
330479,andre replieoooooooors interesting breed person
330480,people saying pretty much anything he's tweeted last year
330489,honestly want understand train thought cant fathom ha rationale
330491,that's like dollar store ape ser much like trash opinion
330492,interest would chat saying julien andre entitled wants face projects got popularity due involvement feel like rug
330493,one dev builder another one stop mental comparisons
330494,doesnt stop projects closed frontend handovers
330495,contracts live working frontend maintained anyone outcry helplessness problem andre pointing
330497,hi julien
330498,curiosity anyone else considered andre always make anon acct feels like getting back alternatively may already
330499,like really lamenting exit innovation andre represents space something else
330500,agree symbol trend
330501,think meant something different understood last line edited make clearer
330502,yes new regulation phase maybe want anon cleaning movement work done fulfilled announced going build within right seek privacy
330504,aaaaand enough seeing bit craziness point
330505,what's yearns dd process add new strat vaults public info around
330506,public process mostly internal points check governance contracts changed upgraded msig situation signers known space past audits matches latest deployed code long protocol working bug bounties handled issues past checked strategy contract code use strategist writing strategy needs deep dive prove going get rug second security person validates document goes thru code well things dont like protocol usually talk ask change keen finally score strategy given riskimpact score usually brand new protocols higher risk would cap impact amount life ending yearn inital review schedule recurring reviews strategy dd give audit firms security contractors internal security role schedlue like inspections done risk score improve strat take funds

330518,thx ser ibidino magic
330520,
330521,
330522,lots chatter ct think theres lot misinformation contracts code still live hosting uis shutting pitch host new uis contributors projects choose trustnode posted write personally dont think bad thing andre done much space wants time leave hood thats fine people around buidl imo space weird place rn surprised
330523,cryptd0e see taking uis
330524,nice ty missed one
330525,that's indication even people heavily involved space wrong mental model comes defi products
330526,convex apys
330527,might well shit mouth
330528,algo stables 5% apy loool fkoff
330529,imagine taking risk 5%
330530,omfg anoos red apys disaster
330532,yea think cause lot chaos grifting space unfortunate thats come really miss andre
330534,probably chaos necessary evil long run way see web3 dangerously close developing kind centralized dependencies web2 realignment like time time need keep check
330535,dangerously close exaggeration far either
330537,plenty developers ecosystem andre come go like many others unnamed contributed respective projects even get recognition work shall pass
330538,accurate becoming harder harder draw distinction web2 web3 everyone slaps web3 things even vc backed vc chains running things defi needed bit kick nuts help correct things
330539,definitely lot space become kind networking mess web2 space accused capital getting locked channels outsiders rarely access
330540,use dao funds host uis would good publicity
330541,imagine thinking web3 web2 involves different ppl tech different ppl
330542,think less people rather markets industry evolves happens every single new space money flow alwayshasbeenjpeg
330544,i'd say advantage defi web2 space underlying structures power ecosystem deliberately designed push back natural human inclination gravitate towards strong authoritative figures happened web2 world there's nonzero chance yearn's backend exist
330546,except limited number applications decentralisation meme
330547,wrong scope statement much limited assume
330548,clue price action could cripple group's ability operate product guess stand corrected
330549,can't sure point i'm making applications atm
330551,i'm discussing price action fundamental product still work tomorrow question honestly think yearn finished andre left sounds shortsighted
330552,disagree ser i'm making point saying applicable limited number projects
330553,despite 'immutability contracts'
330554,contending given project's value based purely hype rather fundamental valueoffering
330555,yes depending ask
330556,large degree unfortunately
330557,think
330558,ser rhetorical question
330559,cases yes
330560,let's accept premise projects built mainly hype leads question people building fantom like andre people might come andre stayed found something else interesting yearn people building yearn like andre actually see utility think utility point hype selfperpetuating without andre though year ago answer would different projects solidly probably unlikely brandloyalty outside man however think fantom prior january running fine minimal involvement andre build plans stop building cause andre involved like people
330561,id say yearn network effect banteg andre
330567, real
330568,china bad influence smh
330569,iirc russia exercises regularly makes sure ready disconnect global internet time needed
330570, built working frontend improving core remove annoying rpc issues also work routing issue
330571,document mention anything kind far russia disconnected internet outside example cogent magistral operator banned ru region cisco list big
330572,document lists tips opsec nothing interpreted disconnecting internet anyway moscow march 20th confirm
330573,satellite internet equipment set connected sure know something like happens 20th
330574,mostly bonds keeper misbehaves protocol rug bond similar nodes work chain punish downtime rather misbehaviour
330575,thinking tangent project last year limiting factor basically oracle niche ie likely unique queries economics paying multiply replicated work looking storing information means need either 1 high roller users 2 specialised blockchain 3 tight tradeoffs blockchain trilemma eg 'decentralised' 35 validators probably 2 3 options chainlink http get 3 must possible iirc parsiq intending move towards 2 tbh want see happen feel free want dm spitball may still one day buidl thing eyes brains good thing
330576,something like grt nodes work maybe
330577,familiar would guess yeah
330579,gm
330580,nice back

330584,hahaha polygon brother trying compliant regulated home crypto startups importantly daos
330586,uae
330587,gn ser still remember explicit replies andre twitter many others polygone team like mr bjelice disgrace whole crypto community
330588,transitioned system years ago sovereign internet law announced 2019 sometime tested
330589,ohh know harsh words reason guess became apparent last days sadly time couldnt take anymore
330590,respectfully avoid personal conflicts etc
330591,like man left leave alone sandeepnailwal great
330605,rightly said sir dont married game positive sum good work advancement web3 instead participating games incumbants
330606,come pirouette someone else's grave
330607,incumwhat sounds painful
330608, urge sides remain sane use desperate measures mutes thank

330613,ok feels like bear market
330614,rektplebs going get busy
330615,
330616,devs something mentality
330617,lrc ceo stepping
330622,yea felt bera couple months
330623,socially least
330624,outlier communities tho
330625,anyone know eth merge
330627,
330628,think heard time summer planned delayed much guess one really knows
330630,next chinese new year
330631,shanghai planned q4
330632,
330633,bro one yearn shit cause andre
330634,never trust african
330635,fantom seed round andre even board yet
330636,yes point
330637,well fair say andre fantom would still chasing blockchain remitance deals afghanistan stuff like there's profit made
330638,true always double check stuff however wo official ui little stopping anyone spin replicate change smart contract interactions transferfrom yeah would neat least something backed digital entity
330639,fantom defi andre
330640,mean like cover cream 
330641,btc eth created multichain tells lot
330642,99% defi chain ported cloned eth project tbf
330643,evm ledgers
330644, point wrapped tokens creations
330645,mint nft address risk interacted potential scam contract address approve nft
330646,andre stuff redacted really dont get point let person detox one day discussions enough covered also fantom chats exhaustive explanation affiliation moving
330648,ur probably fine general calling random smart contracts compromise ur existing assets unless called approve beforehand obviously go around
330649,thanks mate
330650,necessarily think projects built hype ac building projects one left space 2018 2019 space borderline unrealistic terms expectations right mainly bulloverheated put perspective project released stage development would received different reception released late 2019 time builders helping users realistic mostly releasing ipograde protocols token returning exponential gains gate rug builders love building start lose incentivemotivation build anything
330651,yeah great useful protocols used much certainly could useful degen farm good secrets
330653,thumbsup reaction
330654,useful protocol ponzinomics really useful
330655,uniswap compound aave curve prior wars many
330656,protocols use yearn uniswap matcha
330657,rhetorical yeah good utility first protocols
330658,solid actually useful 001% fee swap lot utility potential kill uniswap sushi curve altogether
330659,need builders iterate acs work
330660,bring product mvp finalized product
330661,hopeful least one fork achieve
330662,isnt north star incentives solidly direct volume pool
330663,thats dexes guess
330664,shh i'm trying work sir make contemplate zen ponzinomics 
330665,frankly 001% swap get swaps aggregators
330666,get volume without rewards
330668,
330669,guys farming solidly frenzy seemingly eth stables
330670,backyard ser
330671,would iterate whats missing
330672,iterate always mean add new features could tweaking existing ones find right productmarket fit
330673,agreed would tweak
330674,never lie elections war hunting georges clemenceau
330675,long theres liquidity emissions tail provide liquidity one unless limited emissions highly valuable true transaction volume high enough make minisicule percentage fees minuscule absolute terms happen three months drive volume
330676,
330677,large discrepancy occurs arb mgavaudan
330678,03% fee uniswap pools often see revenue 1% pools higher volumes
330679,yearn ever update 220 given lower rates milkyklim
330680,
330681,interesting
330682,thoughts maia building metis hermes solidly fork
330683,blanket solution may work cases time eventually attackers recognize patterns monitoring systems work around could effective low effort hacks long term essentially different idea circuit breakers problem lies defining suspicious conditions way covers hacks regular activity
330684,solidly revenue doesnt go liquidity provides token incentive
330685,think theoretical assumption solid correlate fees thus making issuance valuable lps even amounts reduce
330686,lord want rage quit crypto go take look plebs losing minds potential chain reset indicated occurring evmos community channel
330687,
330688,
330689,personally agree would correct move case liquidity pools osmosis evmos dex rektage would p2p trading
330690,tbh trying make somewhat fair launch thats moat kinda0 aspire make closer fair launch equal opportunities onchain
330691,context evmos larping saying maybe refixing bad
330692,supposed fair launch rekt drop presale devs definitely difficult position think worse start clean weeks ready
330693,would bridges work case wouldnt lets say eth sides bridges basically locked
330694,either way one group gonna lose solution satisfy everyone
330695,bridges active yet
330696,also true perhaps early ones got edge bad left w
330697,would imply real randoms longterm fine
330698,well lose exactly reset real players would trading p2p given state things doubt much traded p2p
330699,can't tell amount otc traders everyone done would lose course thee hand could argue risk buying otc prefer reset solution think people affected negatively partial launch diluted rewards anyone errors andor using ledger
330700,even edge failed launch requires major upgrades would technically simpler relaunch v2 much cleaner start things either way certainly interesting state events want devs shoes right see v2 commits github think they've slept week
330701,also calling rekt drop rekt rekt drop kinda funny chain
330702,recent trend dao governance pioneered dani lives look stellar example governance sommelier zakimanian singlehandedly decided go ahead proposal voted community
330704,web3 scam
330705,look dao
330706,yes scam get lot money vcs go fun crypto events
330707,governance vote freeze someones funds send charity idk lol big problem everyone thinks owe someone i'm waiting adequacy come web3 seems last forever
330708,sommelier showing governance proposals blabla finally zakimanian deciding everything lol
330710,keep twitter shitposting thats also important thing
330711,ridiculous say dont resources proceed verification data meantime raised twice multiple millions top vcs
330712,people still think onegoal game would always side 
330713,wow quite people vocal didnt even keep track tldr
330714,please stop tagging person clear pleb behavior crying antilobsters concrete
330715,discussing move
330716,yes sip tldr yesno etc
330717,come question whether company give damn voting decisions lol
330718,link sip details please previous context
330719,nothing abstract please discussion allowed vacuum'ed
330720,ok proposal sips002 sommelier governance forum distributing somm tokens early eth users next accepted governance step sips003 proposing moving community pool funds preparation distribution somm tokens early eth users today one cofounders writing could verify data sips002 sips003 cancelling sips003 voted community
330721,thank u clear reading
330722,starlink alternatives
330723,course dev hard dont time verify snapshot data doesnt apply shitposting fun denver
330724,sips002 sips003 proposals well discussed community finally accepted governance community members dont understand needed daogovernance theater end one person deciding future 
330725,alternatives course wrote article long time ago describes equipment 
330726,advisory dao 
330727,random smart contract calls approve functions high profile collections think apes art blocks etc would see metamask eg transaction writing function x random smart contract function x kinds things including calling approve functions smart contracts possible
330728,continuing pursue uniswap v3 recipe failure
330729,i'm currently working aave cellar launch
330730,that's primary focus
330731,bandwidth anything else
330732,example 0x69e8b735ef83581de92c2618a1cfa55c05ddafff volumefi distribution zero evidence ever interacted sommelier
330733,really time go audit everything volumefi proposal assumption governance proposal data could trusted
330734,i'm opposed coming distribution pairings uers future
330735,engineering bandwidth work right
330736,peter get frustrated fact data sips 003 proposed volumefi cant validated makes impossible justify continuing airdrop funds would go back community pool means used future ecosystem developments growth protocol zaki already mentioned opposed airdrop early sommelier pairings users currently dont manpower focus let us launch first cellars push staking rewards live revisit
330737,opposed airdrop early sommelier pairings users currently dont manpower focus
330738, tldr lets later
330739,dont see negativity screaming
330740,time help verify data lot people sommelier chat somehow miss point noone saying early users get rewarded someone find fair way verify early user otherwise rewards get diluted people used uniswap eligible sommelier criteria think that's something community constructive help instead purposely misunderstanding whole discussion
330741,right i'm trying figure osmosis incentives land mine hit
330742,eth airdrop conditions would rug osmosis lps
330743,would also lot arb volume across gravity bridge hurt cellar launch
330744,wouldnt sure tldr lets postpone indefinitely
330745,two sides 1 subjective dev team realized changes needed made 2 people users expected airdrop liquidity happened 1 data wasnt verified used excuse 2 devs decided traction timing etc need change 3 votes happened dont reflect point 2 question ye cia said come question whether company give damn voting decisions
330746,fair tldr vardhanam
330747,implicit doxing
330748,neither confirm deny
330749,also months months radio silence community suddenly message telegram chat stating decided go ahead proposal announcements discussion governance forum thats biggest issue
330751,promises endorsements timeline hype happening prior yes understand issue sometimes happening dev teams ae overlyexcited dev milestones always change important hard keep community expectations drive engagement order see somewhat paraswap airdrop issue trying say
330752,solution would every team hired fulltime dev who's discussing forum tg devs get burned agree communication would probably helped fully understand zaki's concerns can't proceed airdrop deep enough sommelier understand milestones get neglected time proceed sip003 first
330753,people retarded summarizes discussion everyone
330755,def lot text read pls tldr ppl think soft governance hard governance dev said nah maybe later
330756,well people retarded 1% brains comms allow 1% wave potentially become contributors dont need comfort total idiots comforting anyone leaves sad place
330757,yes
330758,probably difference orderbook vs vamm perp models
330759,we're also eth l2s evm wont arbing anything solana short term
330760,ser
330761,never many faught little things
330762,goldilocks
330763,important likes rightcorrect thats lesson andre taught
330764,popularity contest end day yes
330765,tiresome yea agree lobsterdao feeling like principals office school playground fight
330766,cia ivan mindshare
330767,

330776,yup
330777,
330778,interesting anyone following uxd comments maybe mgavaudan
330779,mean i'm obviously biased they're essentially selling governance token cover losses incurred huge negative funding rates
330780,world model works would justify imperfections caused
330781,went different model lemma abstract pnl vault
330782,lot sustainable imo
330784,current mechanism
330785,said i'm sure they're thinking ways improve model dirac seems like smart guy
330786,also clear lemma also going improve current model since growth limited otherwise
330787,actually coming really cool new primitive built usdl soonish 
330788,still possible withdrawal binance kraken russia also credit card sepa ruble
330789,use p2p currently work tinkoff bank card cards issued ruterritory work russia since 10th unionpayissued cards eg zenit bank work abroad crossboarder payments continue working russia abroad 10th
330790,deus optimize offering onchain derivs funding rates big volume sources example cex decentralized way offering 3rd party lps take trade onchain possibly countertrade elsewhere someone uxd contact
330791,ob peer pool
330792,chain l2
330794,anyone know extension tool similar one goal add documentation comments natspec solidity code filled
330798,
330799,new fud
330800,believe decided take opportunity overhaul quite aspects staking imagine explains partially least taking long rollout
330801,good tokenized etf funds chain

330807,anywhere onchain trade commodities preferably l1
330808,kwenta optimism 
330809,apparently commodities
330810,mirror terra uso ishares silvergold
330811,sweet hoping get exposure actual commodities may work well thank
330812, thanks gamestop 
330813,partner dumping
330814,tell implementation looking info might want listen bankless podcasts recently held panel poap lens protocol
330815,actually listened much terms actual impelemtation
330816,website provides public keys cex'es possible
330817, exactly want nametags could useful 
330818,
330820,gamestop weakhand lmao selling news
330821,gm wallets people use metamask
330822,frame awesome
330823,
330824,thanks give try
330825,
330826,samczsun saved day
330827,hello friends question ceos funds whats medium fee usually pay people help attracting investments commission usually 100% transparent investors hidden much pay attracted currency projects tokens formulating contract brokers thinking prices ok
330828,project good enough number 0
330829,interesting one know cases around 75125% yeah mentioned much better 0
330830,hello everyone best way purchase stablecoins via wire transfer cash institutional investors anyone faced issue considering directly via circle tether 10bp commission maybe better ways
330832,25% know cases always outliers based bringing demands always transparent projects though account part contract would sign introducer
330833,0 %
330834,ideally sometimes bridge helps
330835,guys know promised talk andre 
330836,andre said devs helping find bugs launch one basmag0x assume remember nothing andre conspiracy showing solidex grapes bit inside due work assume love hate
330837,solidex got pretty bad score us 24%
330838,testing audit access controls
330839,usually good sign project built last
330840,said chat admin audit can't release details till complete going sus
330841,seems bit inside grapessolidex domain registered solidly even announced
330842,solidex immutable
330843,solidly
330844,voting bug persists work around suppose
330845,way defisafety rates projects build last can't apply blanket ratings various defi project behave
330846,like team said curve timelock
330847,iterate processes frequently specialise review based dev feedback
330848,shows understanding protocol works hard take work seriously
330849,nothing defisafety could potentially useful public good service current form
330850,contacted development team advance publishing review never heard anything back lot reviews collaborative efforts developers eg stakedao goes live later today weekslong discussion developers carefully applying questions ensuring relevant
330851,basam0x twitter account created along grapes finance though 's mock account
330852,never us shouting void give dev teams much time necessary highlight things userbase
330853,appreciate confidence us we're open feedback might improve public good 
330854,btw charlieeth guys decide entrust solidex venft quite millions process
330856,can't apply checklist protocol decide whether meets security standards robust protocols minimal admin rights immutability penalize non existing admin rights sitting behind timelocked multisig another note that's personal opinion none teams owe time want help work towards report that's fine basically get hurt want take time show things work
330857,insiders pushed sucked wasnt much choice though
330859,look code look available options talk people much short notice guess matter though
330860,can't get read solidex code skem cash grab ground built last ui seems great lol
330861,semianon semiinsider devs think decent intentions cant say anything else bugs natural new code nobody protected see virtue time nobody attest
330862,hmm see confusion penalise protocols timelocks provided explain timelocks look convex review c2tp super clear explaining worked good job documenting wrote guide citing cvx near perfect example score protocols rarely scored content security measures instead need show they've considered documented whether deserve time that's get requested protocols frequently userbase time work us that's fine we're serve we're serve user base hope makes little clearer thanks
330863,see cvx clearly states use timelocks award points
330864,see correlation hacked protocols ratings
330866,sure helps harms
330867,correlations drawn ever nobody ever safe devving hard need protec
330868,function calls approve matter way permissions work erc20721 assets means approve call originate eoa address another contract
330869,award points whether projects explains design choices either understand judge based dont unless somehow rating communication efforts project
330870,pmriviere sorry comment tinfoil info 
330871,fair go bit way explain stuff though charlie referring
330872,what's point ratings
330873, wrote months ago draw conclusions bring data make decisions i'd need run numbers make sure still perfectly relevant
330874,similar ico ratings think good intentions users respond different criteria take raw info dont look score
330875,arguing w u charlie btw
330876,drama redacted idk probably matters wonderland friends
330877,generally speaking transparent code good developer practises trend towards safer code identifying practises might look like increase number eyes looking code thereby making robust
330878,probably cause rumours
330879,developers stuff might seem fairly straightforward youus outsiders perspective extremely confusing virtually impossible compare one protocol another scores attempt bring form comparison
330880,instead caring people got allo guys built sound solid work guess see
330881,yes remember think jumping hoop valuable use time explain multisig contracts works
330882,ye matters tbh werent allos hidden transparent enough
330883,bear even devs hate
330884,yes hate expos
330886,
330887,code immutable i'm pretty sure long fantom exists
330888,ahhh blast secret
330889,protected u bit ser blz rug
330890,whats defirating gearbox
330891,333333
330892,
330893,sad devs cannibalize public already hard enough arm chair speculators hounding
330894,gm looking thru sources regarding unbatch merkle root tx diploma verification tx done university suggestions exactly poke etherscan
330895,high play nice mewny
330896,88% worked together ivangbi 0xmikko good developer team good preexisting documentation remarkable commitment decentralisation actual execution start 
330897,hehe know 3
330898,poking fun
330899,make charlieeth hate gearbox although already
330900,
330902,whyfud
330903,fantom defi user since sushi deployed started gaining traction beautiful epoch everything ran smoothly payed 1 gwei less second later got transaction done fast forward i'm paying 19ftm 5k gwei transaction go x undetermined minutes invisible queue see people paying 10150k gwei transactions every time there's use resembles ethereum's people shifted big hopes things getting fixed fvm say 2 years charismatic coauthor lachesis leaves add state ethereum getting better better well wrapping people went promising escalable eth killer backed good dev ethereum transactions getting absurdly high people leaving said dev leaving network showing can't escalate cherry top happened polygon planned merge hermez go live year even counting existence others like starknet etc makes waiting 2 years minimum big leap faith
330904,interesting thanks lot ser
330905,cool name maybe could help us read stick irony
330906,1 cult left kill terra fans
330907,andre daniele tetra etc poked love except daniele scammer coco shit factual people cult pitchforks observation yes people retarded default
330909,ser sunny please language
330910,hesitant pay employees apologies
330911,dont forget ada tiktok cult
330912,sec write love letters terra ded
330913,many large projects nothing new something poke make fun man
330914,assume fucking got rekt options trading scams robinhood retarded kids got wanted
330915,jest terra fantastic project rightfully earned place w 2nd largest network tvl visionary tfl upend fabric economy clearly identified sarcasm
330917,stableivan like 20% apr
330918,might well farm 100% peniscock stablecoin ofc mean subjectively dont buy ust model borrow ust low rate farm sure
330919,happily delete asked solidly hype less looking larger brain explanation invalidate findings super low slippage super low fees protocol protocols use votes direct emissions lps use votes collect fees bribes positive feedback loop lock solid share via ve33 low slippage low fees protocol protocols lead high volumes complete positive feedback loop totally get love however votes pools snapshot direct emissions immediately snapshot move votes pool want start accruing bribes real time effectively break positive feedback loop since bribes locked voters snapshot totally breaking positive feedback loop sure renders bribes irrelevant terms influence votes snapshot lets everyone grandma goobble bribes without actually voting emissions pool
330920,
330921,case one would actually use 'built in' bribing system
330922,know alot people crypto space disgusting
330923,ye contract basically flawed immutable
330925,complete implementation travel rule prove difficult considering every technology allows particular information stored transferred would much easier set global register identified addresses procedure also used banking 
330926,mostly pleb larps blue prints years would ignore
330927,hope
330928,careful ivangbi gonna start appearing twitter reply guy akshually
330929,like consensus possible vote context ethical brantly abstained indeed sorry say alex's narrative hold aka 'ppl delegated vote could redelegated others' probably result different would liked see delegated vote party supported brantly
330930,ethical vote option interests voting concept useless
330931,lol us presidents televised voting every year
330932,agree general let's say another way cynical boomerang
330933,gn fam spotted cool concept 
330934,suggest using though worth mentioning guide 
330935,context missing ppl deciding may leave vote importantly president vote 1 there's delegation would different delegated votes move smone else supported brantly vote
330936,that's presidential congressional etc etc election incumbent deciding leave stay
330937,way around bull markets bite eachother's heads bear markets try become friends
330938,hey tell little api 1inchi want approve coin get back big hexcodebut send codewant set limit order want code c nethereum libraryi hope help methanks advance
330939,thanks expanding hope web3 use improved mechanisms
330940,possible downsides invisible ink
330941,tell someone someone watching
330942,youd definitely get drunk tell people
330943,see club due strobe lights 
330944,seems ppl taking granted transparency aspect crypto governance focusing person voted self interest natural behaviour expected crypto rather abstainers example lead resentment infighting good case study general
330945,ppl like system built allows individuals vote leave instead way around
330946,ppl like voted ppl like ppl still delegate geez maybe realize ppl different opinions that's whole point around governance
330947,yearn still charge 2% management fee thought removed point
330948,yes
330949,thanks vpepo
330950,tattoo master lol mean risk
330951,problem founders much voting power unless smth like gearbox
330952,definitely great case study judging none honestly ens reached thank brantly team astonishing job pointed good point crypto governance better visibility that's great question mechanism working expected thinking correct probably governance vote change governance curious see kind phenomenon case
330953,mean like generating boilerplate comment sections actually documenting well
330954,gearbox great extreme example tradeoffs pls unlock tokens sir ivan 99% projects expect anything team still holding majority short term also forcing project fall apart mode tradeoffs everywhere
330955,extension 4 mustache templates parsing
330956,yessssss
330957,show study shows democratic process leads better outcomes
330958,ppl founded project say bad thing i'll never get idea building something give away voting rights
330959,mechanism imo working expected mechanism use arguable governance around system function v different governance around people
330960,100%
330961,good thing bad expect operating teams give majority ownership community start guess agree
330962,think corner case scenario event occurred difficult plan
330963,100% solid situation ppl invested determining rewards pools they're holders
330964,tools use check sentiment ratificate decision like
330965,think problem boundaries team community expect defined thus endless drama devscommunity interests
330966,adversarial governance structure 13 multisig 1 update governance two phase conmit revoked 23
330967,thinking loudly voting make decision wo community would get result
330968,team stake wont make willing go extra mile keep long term value locks etc dont get
330969,100% yea one example comes mind maker right mcd launch foundation still say protocol community pressured pass changes disagreeing foundation changes almost caused protocol implode months later
330970,ja that's raise question problem tools aka current governance framework express catch kind situations
330971,community generally equals 3 4 whales friends family team got super early founders vs whales much community involved
330972,community
330973,point initial distribution could fairer
330974,chilling discord posting memes make community
330975,think trauma team building exercise
330976,good source inspiration correct implode early giving away tokens
330977,community gone
330978,think matter distribution it'll end whales vs founders end 95% community 5% voting power
330979,spoiler many questions thinking governance protocol building feedback relevant want disavow biasesbeliefs
330980,assuming governance model capital vote
330981,timelock think protocol young still important act fast fix production bugs appeared mostly ct fud campaign centralization bla bla pressuring change months later black thursday happened 0 bids etc need act fast fix liquidation system possible people lost money rest history
330982,could wrong general arguing contrary
330983,concentration inevitable
330984,remember make association retrospect better control somehow
330985, thats physics
330986,nothing inevitable except death taxes sir
330987,mmm constraints want models outside token transfer buy etc still believe there's rainbow governance mechanisms msig buyable tokens
330988,yes progressive decentralization makes sense ppl'community' impatient greedy think know actually protocols works sometimes think know better devteam created system devteam always gets blamed things goes bad anyway
330989,sure constraints that's thing inevitability it'll still happen
330990,centralization system efficient 
330991,end ppl matter forms still phase users customer owner blameable
330992,getting circular
330993,solve make illegal rich make illegal poor make illegal sell make illegal buy
330994,ahahah 1 great chatting yfi still 20k
330995,muh familia needs circulate gear soon ser pls must disrupt dao model
330996,comrades go excellent piece phill daian governance 
330997,none issues discussed new examine literature etc etc
330998,good pointer also 
330999,random dude said community bullshit theory follows someone token best interest whatever increase value token nave guess partly fault defi community calling governance tokens people want govern trenches helping fight instead throne dictator simply shouting orders plebian developers need execute dont care protocol dont care would soon sell token longer think contributing enough standards wont try add value happy spending endless hours time asking updates explain detail thought processes endless back forth pointless menial topics governance community kill innovation development dont
331000,governance convinced mediated suicide web3
331001,yes thank emo andre insightful diatribe
331002,good thing guy stopped making daos article
331003,lol say something masochism
331004,problem governance using web1 ways creating proposals modeling done etc one benchmarks proposals excluding gauntlet network ofc
331005,cannot answer perspective builder agree consequences strongly believer natural tensions parties must exist key good things
331006,even
331007,systems presume trained market
331008,governance systems trained actors
331009,eg stock market trained market
331010,market governance proposals randy dao quite sophisticated developed hence lends gaming etc
331011,want chess players governance market
331012,problem governance crypto people think squeeze democracy something dna plutocracy
331013,got kids playing tic tac toe
331014,get surprised ends plutocracy go let's pile things top repeat
331015,someone read article posted
331016,inb4 real governance yet fo tried
331017,teddywoodward ser lp redeem expiration time 1 get lp tokens representation sell back pool even liquidity quite low would assume totally fine 2 lp tokens received used something else like collateral somewhere
331018,boilerplate built something based library found always surprises immature tooling blockchain development compared traditional development also terms reflection basedsmart code refactoring
331019,hey ivangbi redeem maturity lend march june exit early whenever want lend december maturity three month period march june wont able exit early 1 lend get back fcash tokens sell fcash tokens back liquidity pool cash exit early size loan much larger liquidity pool might trouble exiting early always redeem maturity fine matter size 2 fcash used collateral notional could borrow currency different currency notional fcash also currently working protocols take fcash collateral notably fiat dao launches able mint fiat fcash collateral
331020,sup oil synths anywhere
331021,mirror
331022,muso yeah anything else available
331023,synthetix going relaunch soil thats know
331024,whats concern muso
331025,nickel synths
331027,terra
331028,pronounce soil oil
331029,pause oil
331032,problem dgov people forgotten tech supposed scale coordination scale can't create functional systems tech work
331033,i'd argue works social habits still integrated
331034,look radspec fyi
331035,amazing defi wizards whats guys think next big wave defi
331036,gearbox
331037,fixed income leaders
331038,considering blockchain development field younger vscode surprising every bit good tooling exists iterative
331039,options bet im even wizard learning
331040,yeah sophisticated defi trading vehicles good bet
331041,something building 
331042,token ser
331043,thx ser looks cool
331044,edufi
331045,synthetic markets compared tradfi touched yet
331046,rwa defi might far still
331047,actually working one rn they're closer think
331048,one got maker loan couple months ago
331049,also working launch also arrange collab lobsters
331050,us working thing nice
331051,hope evm preference different least 
331052,that's emotional statement saying decentralized governance impossible means long way go still protocolwise culturallysocially
331053,decentralized governance impossible right fit projects models people try force onto days governance become good way justify token without anything else lot mismatches
331054,zaki reversal seems like issue fixed
331055,perhaps far statements go decentralized governance little hopeful statements adding blockchain mix somehow solves something
331056,ask details loan happens
331057,imo one main issues governance lot models based rfcs work open source projects cases map well governance serious economic incentives involved
331060,favor synthetic markets trading crypto index pegged financial indexes another way derivatives derivatives usually ends crisis mortgage loan backed aaa rated derivatives
331061,
331062,utterly false
331063,look makerdao compound
331064,makerdao gotten governance correct mostly
331065,compound style governance seems pattern go forward openzeppelin offers library
331066,turns picked two worse examples
331067,k
331068,yeah i've done research delegate system operates good example rest defi hasu becoming delegate exciting
331069,probably different ideas whether correct
331070,fuck care frontend
331071,useful idea pretend people say greater people startup
331072,dont think people say
331073,frontend irrelevant data
331074,anyone know bot lets discord members mint nft directly discord server
331075,equality suckers
331076,maybe shifting goalposts fact amusing say least
331077,someone joining late game afforded weight person day 1
331078,there's name centuries old depending far back want go decentralized governance
331079,goalposts
331080,fam turning bit endless back forth
331081,federal reserve decentralized central bank

331088,argue time
331091,devs arguing online
331092,babahahh best tweet
331093,ahem
331094,
331095,wow mean somebody working crypto lied background
331096,dropped elementary school dropped path phd
331097,please tell youre defending
331098,literally uncomfortable 30 minute talk normie friends charles scam
331100,told charles actually founder cardano hired mouthpiece needed full time shill happy let believe
331101,
331102,tfw actually dropped phd clue someone would lie really though somehow prestigious people crypto care went school studied
331103,probably different cardano technically time ico scams would scrape stock photos label exmsft exgoogle exapple 13 years experience
331104,yeah makes sense still see projects usually dont go well
331105,january 2018 started
331106,air ha crypto joke work faang surely outdo everyone
331107,sounds like conspiracy theory eventually turns true form
331108,would say bitcoin ethereum governance
331109,successful things crypto moment perhaps regardless governance although something right
331110,far prefer lack onchain governance governance best governance stance matter course elimination practical every project everything liquity uniswap ignore token rather rube goldberg pretendaos today
331111,governance tokens better chance governing project company stock
331112,see that's possible excluding implementationdetail blockchain element they're identical best case worse otherwise stocks identity people i'm saying that's justification start hosing people's info create better daos yet one would honestly claim alphabet friends daos

331244,yeh
331248,guys using blocktimestamp contract considered vulnerability sometimes eli5
331249,manipulated miners extent
331250,technical limit many addresses usdc might blacklist

331268,someone nuked whole chat whilst middle nuking another staged bot
331270,mercy
331271,jira alternative crypto many builders space prefer use manage whole company remotely development
331273,dont think
331274,clickup great tho
331275,tried service sir 
331276,companies run jira trello traditional startups familiar anything else would much rather pick every web3 devs familiar new project i'll check wonderverse clickup thanks
331277,vulnerability timing needs exact within 30 seconds using lockup need kind precision eg vesting blocktimestamp safe use
331278, also smth cool task management
331279,wonderverse focused making dao's work actual project management side equally good something like clickup team start paid traditionally necessarily need lot dao related functionality
331280,sweet check thanks
331281,osinted service seems domain expired
331282,financial nfts going big component nextgen architectures expect become common way make uiux portable point see actual dapps say live ui embedded within nfts easy obvious way streamline getting positions proprietary marketplaces universal erc7211155 marketplaces
331283,deworkxyz maybe
331284,people use notion usually
331285,oh really i've used notion feel like it'd super helpful project product management stuff
331286,yearn use linear 
331287,chainlink powered algo funds triggered fundamentals changes dex tokens tlvprice ratio 
331288,believe self hosted version notion exists pay notion support dev msft ripped
331289,clickup def seems like closesst i'm looking far
331290,yep many builders use use notion personal agenda crypto widely popular
331291,awesome yeah that's along lines looking linear common space
331292,maybe know use right used seemed none functionality want managing org
331293,hmmm sure clearly better notion imho
331294,
331295,check templates team using traditional solutions l really like notion think one founder also group
331296,crypto friendly guys
331297,ah good old days
331298,cbdcs passed inadverntly unintentionally cause india introducing cbdcs next year biggest onboarding new people crypto 15b people 6% global economy post currency turns cbdc wont long land property turn nft govt assigned wallet perfect use case figure wrap take countrys chain next step defi sure itll next one yeah financial nfts massive adoption
331299,assuming cbdc central bank digital currengy crypto seems doubtful unless india signalled otherwise
331300,feelsgoodbropng make modular systems excited see future holds future defi simplified ux people brainpower remember farm deposited 6 months ago much less use block explorer wrap position fnft suddenly check everything one spot
331301,said hope cbdcs catalyst that's kinda like winning fight opponent heart attack
331302,india already one best digital banking protocols south east asian countries see central government shifting blockchain based currency cbdcs would cut middleman cash reserve bank needs infuse money economy
331303,cbdcs wrapped erc20s canonical versions possibilities endless behave probably like stable coin ability blacklist freeze flip side could create new onboarding channels like hoses pumping users
331304,yeah called crypto blockchain based wait see introduce larger point first time majority indian users experience digital money custodyatleast perception india amazing fintech take step ahead financial products use nice base level understanding actual decentralised crypto immediately term well see good movement
331305,country take currency chain actually decentralises could chance grow massively dump usdt decentralised inrd whatever second
331306,non digital currencies can't
331307,ramp creation chain process rn isnt strong enough though
331309,feb announced blockchain based currency
331310,
331311,could someone tell singlesided dai 27% apy bancor missing thx
331312,breadth governor reserve bank said blanket ban crypto currencies announcement said evaluating blockchain techs use blockchain sure dunno seems bit far fetched think body government wants ban cryptocurrencies introduce open blockchain based currency interact chains
331313,decentralised inrd cbdc decentralization
331317,yeah dont expect inrt whatever decentralised blockchain based confirmed
331318,like stable 1sided pools bancor good since apy high il protection time great almost impossible get tho
331319,see plans yet 
331322,literally screaming gonna pay amazon service listen bird's singing
331325,decentralised use blockchain might well use git excel sheets
331326,recruitement people self custody digital assets understanding important still lost
331327,recruitment people cbdc cb means central bank help self custody understanding
331328,mean people using solana 
331329,recruitment people decentralised technology
331330,that's nice part cbdc helps
331331,arent noncustodial digital wallets rn arent decentralised cbdcs negatives bring understanding people well
331332,going happen
331333,sorry didnt know world leaders told dont want give citizens country issued digital wallets help country see control citizens assets
331334,even people crypto care much negatives telling spongebob street going see cbdc that's practically indistinguishable digital money they've using start caring actually decentralized currency
331335,ser self custody decentralisation seaparate things talking
331336,self custody digital assets first time experience citizens country introduces cbdcs
331337,internet going make everyone programmer
331338,claim even absurd
331339,fintech india insane still self custody wallets
331340,okay agree disagree self custody big deal thats fine
331341,whats need self custody gov issued assets
331342,ser claiming cbdc make normal people care selfcustody reason whatsoever
331343,gov issued asset national currency saying need web3 wallet keep tokens binance
331344,literally opposite asking okay
331345,mitigation risk banks ability use money timebanks restrictive holidays weekends daily timings easier follow transactions differentiated new financial services access freely
331346,reasons keep part money web3 wallets
331347,lol
331348,wallets controlled govt
331349,perception largely people control
331350,normal person
331351,i'm sure understand non custodial wallets work apologize sound rude
331352,largely perception noncrypto people rn yeah sadly govt psyops real
331353,think govt psyops problem
331354,err
331356,summary cbdc cb means central bank make normal people suddenly care self custody order mitigate risks banks okay
331357,ye idk arguing ser mugglesect either
331358,yall know one first uses printing press printing indulgences still killed power catholic church long run crypto cbdcs exact scenario nearly thousand years later
331359,ability rug writing click button exact incredibly generous
331360,intentionally ser avg citizen digital wallet didnt restrict transactions basis holidays timings like banks doindian banks terrible ill self custody money understand point
331361,matter introduce cbdcs ultimately system less efficient soviet union thriving black market exchanging rubles dollars can't fight gravity
331362,anything similar would china's alipay friends
331363,upi shut weekends neither internet banking
331364,even know last time inside physical bank
331365,300 limit upi though
331366,digital wallet average citizen care less i'll self custody ser feel like know cb cbdc means
331367,yeah entirely different part society work fmcg company 2b business transaction received distributors cash dont deposit till absolutely ensure cash stays pretty common ability self custody without banks huge space
331368,never faced issue infact daily transactions go far without issues maybe bank specific limit even makes think similar limits protocol central government
331369,particular reason many businesses cash heavy see incentives jump protocol centralized go anytime government control leaving behind trusty old cash
331370,unless absolutely forced government wants force protocol onto
331371,pepsi coke nestle cant evade tax post gst easily contrary want get rid cash based operations expense massively trust based average business last year cash handling 2% business thats 15b cash based 2% massive
331372,lobsterdao holders get participate dex guru governance future guru tokens details 
331373,paytm likes arent trusted self custody business owners handle multiple cash transactions daily needed bangalore distributor association actually whole session this4050b turnover combined response insanely positive
331374,thats saw slight hope shit show cbdcs largely
331375,
331378,dao rate much higher usdc rate niemerg
331379,seeing persist markets convrersion 11 really
331380,maybe dai less liquidity
331382,thats 03% right
331383,meaning borrowing liquidity
331384,ye curious nobody stepping seems like free yield
331385,although people locked durations dont want

331404,ser literally agreed people use govt wallets saying wallets enable people experience noncustodial wallets explain point owning assets lead movement crypto called selfcustodial probably said noncustodial didnt govts probably thr choice control thus blurring terminology
331405,realize chivo custodial right
331406,realise 60% population uses realise want assets move web3
331407,thats exactly saying
331408,cbdc wallets custodial enable people see point
331409,wich currentky dont dont even try
331410,saying thing happened noncbdc magically happen cbdc
331411,thought bad enough
331412,wow 
331413,government heavily incentivized prevent people seeing point either heavy regulation propaganda
331414,someone mentions cbdc 4 hours later
331415,yes good percent see 15billion people lead movement noncustodials wallets well
331416,thats said

331604,suggest mute someone like consistently puts misleading low quality comments
331605,i'd say around fact likelihood bank run usd low widely accepted everywher growth organic whereas ust grown lot mostly due huge unsustainable apy figures forced adoption issue leverage mim looped apy etc technically ust probably stay peg return pretty fast bank run harm price luna horribly
331606,mechanisms stability different obivously ust aims track precise value usd usd aims relatively stable
331607,different pegging mechanisms assume u r referring usdc usd
331608,nope im referring usd
331609,read message replying
331610,ah ok assume referring fact bank run asset including usd ust ponzi bankrun meme seems new usdt unbacked meme held ok heavy drawdowns course there's risk there's risk anything
331611,point usd holders stability ust holders unsustainable apy indeed anchor can't sustain 20% apy might see huge bank run hard predict outcome pretty sure that's gist story
331612,level call nearly everything ponzi doesnt mean ponzi ponzi b use argument call another line arguments bs low quality comment nuance content guys comments like get rid

331715,although idea sslhttps works case
331716,mathematically speaking great reserve currency anymore
331717,spheron might help setup build deploy process currently deploy arweave skynet believe plans deploy ipfsfilecoin docs walk attaching handshake domain
331718,anyone tried using asking see would worth time actually test given seems token never heard dead price giving usual scam vibes

331863, dug maplefinance reading cryptocat's post mgnrio abused maple check found
331864,didnt mgnr admit double dipping whats point speculating whether mgnr clean basically admitted
331865,thats point speculating lmao included tx's also reported cryptocat wasnt reported fbg capital involved
331866,section literally titled mgnrio fair game
331867,read showed first mgnrio wrongfully accused's first loan made clean second loan
331868,thats fine thing say article whats wrong would argue fine platform probably wanted anyway
331869,arg isnt whether mgnr's double dipping fair understand article tries suggest mgnr didnt double dip begin wrong fully accused cryptocat also reiterated author i'm saying mgnr already admitted double dipping why's article trying question double dipped trying claim txn cryptocat reported fbg's
331870,double dipping 
331871,thanks sir 
331872,entity borrowing lending protocol get sides liq mining rewards recycling funds
331873,see thanks explaining
331874,ah ye fully agree said 
331875,guys paranoid approvals terra network someone please share approvals work terra ecosystem something like revoke tool check approvals given revoke
331876,know double dipping acceptable technical boundaries done venus example team lose control platform token
331877,thats terrible example venus scam anyway double dipping different cefi defi wrapping around compound fine intended capital real pay fees access fully open etc double dipping kyced undercollateralized protocol gaming system rekt
331878,hm venus context general permissionless protocol ideally expected sybil resistant ensure incentives exploited want btc utxo used pay two people someone mining inflation creating 1000s fake accounts
331879,much better insight situation i'm interested learn
331880,got point search another source aware admitted wrote main point however fbg capital's activity fact still managed get loan week ago although double dipped
331881,think usage double dipping wrt incentives entityprotocol different double dipping used aggregate sense defi cefi economies eg x give loan x use debt instrument collateral lend z economy x z double dipped capital inflate activity essentially reason derivative markets big totally legit till x z separate entities
331882,got surely formula work whats inflation rate given frequency volume double dips economies xy z 
331883,yeah realized could give polite suggestions writing skills would say highlight fbg point claim reiterate clearly conclusion way reads seems exonerate mgnr
331884,ill thankful suggestions one first writings aware need learn lot yet
331885,inflation well designed protocols build sybil resistance eg cant mine btc without actually spending proportionate electricity defi protocol emissions gamed cos real deterrance requires users spend real capture value outside incentives kyc amongst strongest form sybil resistance maple incident embarassing team cos funds gaming incentives despite kyced implying either team dumb intentionally turning blind eye boost marketable activity
331886,economies think real world one today except quants gs morgan stanley etc clue derivatives related capital base large complex
331890,saw message coinlist lobsterdao members got great gift coinlist would like linked old conversation group would interesting

331927,inflation filecoin wildly high
331928, filecoin cost amazon cost 001% cost amazon s3 seems bit crazy
331929,wonder could semipermanent thing
331930,3b circulating mcap v 34b fully diluted
331931,since theres burn mechanism also
331932,last checked file coo far cheaper aws network vastly provisioned supply v utilization also token great 
331933,u find data curious see data sources
331934,many crypto co's relying aws ec2 also get expensive quickly
331935,starting see protocols infrastructure providers begin look running bare metal
331936,findings fil circulating supply hit 2 billion units fil able reach yottabyte cloud storage capacity 20 years time yottabyte 1000 times current storage capacity aws azure google cloud combined 2 billion tokens slashed tokens counted theres 29 million tokens slashed far
331937,first years quite high yeah
331938,
331940,1gib storage currently 00000109 year fil insanely subsidised

332003,fantoms case look new consensus mechanism among things
332004,mean look cardano absolutely uninteresting always pulled scheme basically
332005,opinion funny thing fantom even chain especially evm chain way rekts capabilities research
332006,interesting word consensus brings joy spark eyes retail investors heard gymbros turned brypto shills youtube highly doubt slightest idea consensus matter etc
332007,use stablecoin wbt eth bridge routes unaffected
332008,average retail investor even enough technical understanding actually recognize superior chain one simply believe parrot influencers tell
332009,4 years ago perhaps remember discussions ccr whitepaper
332010,missing point actual circumstance story told
332011,fantom category avax cardano solana retailers

332074,acceptable standard blockchain moment chain goes gets restarted dead longer legitimate perhaps never
332075,issue validstor shutting much delegation power time 6 hours happened user traction chain number validators remains biggest issue fantom issue afaik solved
332076,never use chain issues one point including eth
332078,

332084,thank
332086,stripe crypto article comments
332087,that's interesting sysops perspective could reliable upgradesmaintenances probably sharding would help curious thoughts high availability blockchain interesting argument
332088,seamless pow upgrades sure what's problem technical point view pos think two different cases one planned upgrade another investigating performance issues require shutdown network
332090,pow upgrades really seamless though miss notification fail update software end mining wrong chain head
332091,far know nothing truly selfupdating introduces risk supply chain attack bad update
332092,closest i've seen maybe avalanche run node script pulls latest release builds redeploys that's fine there's single client software
332093,whereas eth numerous clients
332094,seamless network mean
332095,still reliant everyone coordinating software updates arbitrary block number though
332097,thanks thinking canary production upgrades isolate part network understand performance issue atm ethereum least promoting deploying software
332098,link plz
332102,reminds com programming

332155,curious would affect degenbox strategy obv high net worth wallet sybil way back original yield however im sure going work degenbox
332156,possibly idea behind proposal since anchor ppl hate degenbox much
332157,wonder happens leverage positions whole chain
332158,nothing chain running
332159,give example pure fiction instead fact really agree statement
332163,missed listen tonight
332164,done scriptsmanually anyways segregate 100s wallets automatically claim
332165,one question web3 data people shill web3 say owned users owned users they're accessible everyone without owner's permission anyone use owned house let's take nansen example datas really owned users chain users sue nansen using datas profit data owners also require etherscan display transactions data owned
332166,think conflating several things digital assets certainly controlled anyone else example tx history non private chain might visible one else spending coins
332167,controlled either cann't set permission people use data profit cann't anything
332168,i'm talking data asset
332169,think tx metadata data value often scope people talk digital asset ownership worried abt people profiting txs consider using smth like aztec
332170,see contradiction web3 protocols offering ownership certain asset types necessarily offering full ownership
332171,yeah question turns whether onchain activity belongs user
332172,fwiw various zk schemes data
332173,eg revealing x user initiates
332174,mean people choose ethereum already admit transaction accessable everyone hand want accessed others choose use
332175,yeah eth like many networks atm merely pseudonymous
332177,what's best way get random number without vrf
332178,depends chain timestamp problems dont rly apply u trust validators networks 
332179,lots qs need synchronous rng many bits forsecuring
332180,
332181,back isnt
332184,think message got deleted last night reason ill post one better good reference ppl wanting know yield farming 
332185,jump whole reading list read new crypto

332194,
332195,sorry shared already
332196,fantom underpriced per tvl say fantom scale well chains scale poorly l1
332197,fantom seems scale decently far given high usage
332198,lol source polygonscan
332199,polygon network working fine
332200,seems myth due one rpc gets overloaded every time run never wait seconds get included actually getting tx
332203,i've tried developing times rpc works general rule thumb find evmish chains fall apart heavy load
332204,interesting seems kind client problem perhaps lachesisnetworking side
332205,basing tvl say network undervalued eth overvalued
332206,0 idea never vested dig deeper
332207,brilliant post norswap new fault proof system optimism ser fraud proofs translation fault proofs 
332208,hey lobsters im trying teach query contract intention displaying data browser understanding ethereum works super basic coding ability reason im reaching group ask thinking right way searched simple example solutions perhaps im looking correct spot begin aiming display lp pairstoken balances learn query json planning using infura web3js reasonable tools querying small amounts contract data thanks heaps
332209,hey guys founders african region research wanted pair eyes continent fair call ecosystem there's like 50 countries
332210,anyone knows bit terra would willing answer questions dm
332211,yeah that's fine
332212,
332213,thanks fault proof new term we're trying push capture they're designed catch rugs also commonplace bugs eg sequencer forking canonical l2 chain reflected l1 there's also legal angle idea succesful challenge implies commited fraud makes lawyer sweaty imho first reason good enough already

332248,sybilling airdrops kinda discussed death already point rehashing
332250,also confiscating perps funds via governance though
332251,
332252,stand corrected original post wasnt governance attack response potential one case forta agents rock weakness though publish agents attacks circument alerts easily might interest also check stuff microsoft a18z working around

332255,tried running slither
332256,hmm
332257,ive reporting coding style fraktal owner never listen
332258,reporting actual bugs subject style errors latter 100% sure pissing offf 
332259,code interesting import rentrancy guard never use
332260,forta crazy cool endless utilization opportunies
332261,missed things
332262, 
332263,runtime security ethereum ask oppossed recieving alerts condition happens forta agents scan mempool trigger condition allow react
332264,anyone know mcap tbal wonderland

332278,
332279, anyone that's interested potion onboarding ends soon
332280,project
332281,options
332282,autocompounders loaded contract risk forked yearn use instead yearn proven lot established safe find beefy really scummy include fees front end apy calculation show either autocompounders show apys fees included that's industry standard they're intentionally misleading users god forbid actually inform users impermanent loss works they're sitting harvesting fees unknowning newbies imo
332283, blockmates great overview
332284,whats unlock thing going dao first
332285,yes legal mumbojumbo remove risk team similar way gearbox guess
332286,ser blz wil kill u u ask stuff
332287,launching protocoltoken distribuition via nft distribuition public sale nfts 14th need register
332288,keep seeing unlock thing twitter nfts wasnt sure anymore
332289,makes sense
332293,hi wondering someone could help typical testing tools frameworks blockchain developers use
332294,check sir eth security tools existing defi dev roadmap 
332295,hey fam interesting proposal certora bring continuous formal verification aave care aave integrated protocols future safety take look 
332296,interesting certora proposes formal verification given v3 already formally verified v2 also v3 yet correct
332297,they're proposing continuous formal verification different process
332298,correct
332299,thanks river0x give implicit fixed messaging v3 half proposal continuous process place
332300,details
332301,
332303,looks like vote going well yay formal verification great test many protocols possible consider getting formally verified expensive also valuable
332304,yep missing 5k votes pass deadline tomorrow 1030 utc
332305,size aave even question problem always participation
332306,curious works user deposits funds dydx deposit contract offchain clob exchange get notified said deposit polling xamountoftime user clicks deposit see users account deposit contract balance broader scope blockchain stuffs communicate non blockchain stuffs sort inverse oracle problem
332307,aave might consider looking maker's delegate system worked seem equivalent maker's delegates active things considered roughly 10% mkr tokens delegated maker done lot work area though aave can't pull one hat overnight 
332308,events
332310,maker votes 10 address participating yes delegates good system terribly flawed
332311,according keikaku
332313,oh wow yes see lol certainly work done governance
332314,makes sense offchain clob trust implicitly would trigger check onchain
332315,yo fellas could someone pinpoint direction mining oriented tg group i'm talking industrial scale dd want ask questions thanks 
332316,know defi trusted group
332317,contract unless gets exploited way rewrites events think there's much worry
332319,yes sir trying understand works see hwo achieve something comprable soylana soylanarust eventemit
332320,never used solana 
332321,weird system logs emit events per se pull rpc read
332322,thanks seeing discord much soyyy
332323,open issue 
332324,solana plan using zkrollups nah
332325,honestly make sense solana rollups
332326,
332327,mean marketing reasons make sense otherwise
332328,couldnt sidechain validator set save hassle around fault proofs zk circuits
332329,way arent really making trust assumptions validator set pretty small aiui
332331,external call made
332332,anyone insight yesterday's polygon issues trying find independent explanation problem solution can't find anything far
332333,exactly solved yet afaict
332334,yeah one questions find news articles yesterday polygonscan shows blocks already showing also see lot recent tweets claiming yet confused
332335,pos chain that's due hotfix
332336,matic tendermint chain er responsible checkpointing mainnet staking stuff required bridge work idk still halted
332337,got still serious
332338,would basically require validators process double throughput might well increase block size original chain 2x leads set challenges
332339,difference guarantee states fully independent think solana already tricks around parallel access
332340,would want
332341,mean arguemnt want l2s solana im saying probably get similar scaling youd get l2s much less complexity given restricted validator set anyways
332342,give hassles l2s care bridging backforth without advantages
332343,state independence l1 chain l2 desirable feature composability breaks necessary one
332344,achieve level scaling increasing block size network take better option around
332345,yes think agree 
332346,use l1 doesnt need l2
332347,function time eth years state built l1s dont yet understanding theyll eventually encounter similar problems
332348,solana's marketing need
332349,doesnt mean wont eventually
332350,l1s utilized full capacity blockspace contended youd still need l2s
332351,easy add supercomputers kick road
332352,id say function currently insufficient technology
332353,time bsc even 2 state bloat crumbles load
332354,actually great case study ethereum able model growth real world consequences would increased adoption demand
332355,bsc clone isnt kind new technology
332356,think there's rudimentary support bsc erigon it'd nice real world stress test erigon
332357,polygon network back temporary fix eighthour stoppage 
332358,excited
332359,need talk zk staff
332365,hi guys maybe know metric exchange devsi sent 30k usdt contract mistake
332366,want recover
332367,can't find contact message
332368,im almost sure impossible sending tokens directly sc ps case like gnosis safe possible
332369,depends contract
332370,99% chance money sorry man
332371,anyone experience blockchain visualization python lmk
332372,least eyes beefy built kind reputation surviving bcs shit storm last year without mishaps yeah past performance imply future outcome every new vault comes risk even yearn got rekt past course seeing yearn beefys league vaults suit plays also check wip beta platform get much better informed past actual yield fees il hopefully got right cannot confirm code basically flaws mentioned sorry want sound like beefys shill buy tokens lazy farming hoping get rekt fully aware autocompounders add smart contract risk hand reduce vulnerabilities login wallet associated routine compounding manually expose funds potential malware exploits etc
332373,kinda answers place really best hangout defi
332374,hey know dev dm please others said though extremely unlikely
332375,matic still upgrading chain asking fren
332376,
332377,interesting overview economic fallout sanctions apparent plans drastic policy financial measures also touches briefly locals using crypto
332378,3rd party
332379,hey guys dexes erc1155 tokens solutions rely solely os 
332380,sure regarding use case allows direct p2p swaps 1155
332381,thanks look ux easy uniswap though wondering somewhat possible erc1155 tokens behave erc20 aka interacts amms
332382,think rena guys something like back may might check codebase
332383,create adapters comply erc20 interface forward requests underlying erc1155 contract
332384,thanks 
332388,mean function looks like making external calls would vulnerable reentrancy
332390,
332391,nft stuff nftavenue seems kind pretty huge
332392,
332393,tether might able assist that's advantage centralized freezable stablecoins 
332394,
332395,wait isnt becoming bribe protocol top convex another convex convex feels like complex chart reason
332396,weird orgy nice
332397,
332398,actually pretty good
332399,low cap shillers defi sometimes bring interesting ideas saying comparing old defi brains mostly shit others gardens
332400,ceazor guy talked makes really informative videos new protocols
332401,ceazor pamp bags blk ser
332403,clue people r kek 
332404,facts juno genesis stakedrop gamed single entity willingly unwillingly relevant matter rich illegal
332405,maybe helpfull future seed list coinlist 
332406,let's encourage people hold coin taking away peoples coins
332407,equalized
332408,imagine much complaining every time airdrop ethereum sybil'd
332409,going enforce whale cap attempting avoid sybil really take far imo monitoring chain post drop look consolidation accounts pretty dumb tech place enforce prior drop
332410,one unsuccessful gamerkun even got article commending efforts 
332411,hahaha mean get issue cosmos ibc eco idea many drops bootstrap decentralization validators cases like creating massive centralization chains require fair amount time distribution occur post launch decentralization occur anyway decentralized large enough staked mcap many airdrops allocate give bonuses staking outside top 1025 validators good incentive know get gg
332412,known issue pos given enough time validators acquire enough stake cause centralization ya think what's solution
332413,pow also hashad issue geographical sense china miners
332414,'member used make fun eos gubernance shenanigans like 'member
332415,unstaked juno need blockchain immutability meme kek
332416,cough bsc cardano ava etc cough imo larger mcap chains even low mcap chains cosmos ibc eco centralization issue yet
332417,yeah that's issue imo
332418,least permissionless become validator
332419,imagine eos launched year ago would fucking huge
332420,well vote abstain declare neutrality prop 16 because middle things hope proper correspondence core team gentlemen weve voted abstain prop 16 keep governance neutrality basically can't sell equalists come money right
332421,bad timing
332422,really ahead time 
332423,unstaking takes 28 days proposal go effective way earlier
332424,wen larimer chain 5
332425,also needs try hard 4b treasury time hahaha
332426,whale getting harpooned moment
332427,good point
332428,could still vote tho abstain
332429,
332430, juno dev reference i'm whale harpooning via governance token gets sybiled bought bots particular event stakedrop tokens distributed atom holders 50k whale cap per entityperson split 2mm atoms 50k accounts insider information consolidated receiving airdrop effectively recieving 11% chain rewards without ever investing anything chain clarify apparently also ran japanese ponzi sheme invested early atom perhaps even apparently ran tg scams actor could singlehandely drain liquidity rekt retail investors governance vote even close whale screwed unbonding period means tokens locked bad actor would still keep 50k juno 2mm usd 
332431,make stupid games get stupid prizes weird approach alltogether
332432,god forbid looked sybil addresses handing airdrop
332433,dev forbid meant
332434,wen chainalysis find wolf friends 100k accounts smokescreen keep equalists community happy
332435,unlikely distribuition atom holders 100% agree done earlier airdrop distribuition time actor recieving 11% chain rewards without investing single penny
332436,can't figure still pay attention mockchains every year 5 better eths go nowhere
332437,make unlikely
332438, hello permissioned chain dev
332439,anyone idea % high usdt aave polygon
332440,''they gamed airdrop'' can't stand ''they're ponzi'' rally plebs
332441,would purchase atoms would much easier increase team allocation case juno believe 25% tokens tokens distribuited via stakedrop atom holders
332442,huh bad whale accused splitting tokens 50k addresses tokens
332443,50k addresses split 2mm atoms addresses cap 50k atoms
332444,owned tokens yes
332445,therefore maximizing airdrop circunventing whale cap 50k juno max per whaleentity
332446,proof humanity solved repetitive airdrop drama
332447,means dumb thats
332448,imo dumb part consolidated 1822 mm juno 1 address made target community harpoon
332449,community places targets dumb one begin
332450,play communism backyard
332451,ahem wen lawyers
332452,one year snapshot
332453,also gamed osmosis 
332454,nearly much cuz quadratic still chainalalysis post provided earlier shows atoms split starting summer 2020 8 months stargate snapshot
332455,saying agree harpooning whales devs harpooning community voting 80% make distribuition fair even atom whales done earlier airdrop distribuition always elephant room actor could drain liquidity
332456,team doesnt think would leaked info mole 1 years drops blames whale may done got lucky safe following good security etiquette split clients funds
332457,depends assume 80% cartel multiple addresses
332458,really need pretend thing gubernance especially one implementing something obviously broken 50kaddress
332459,harpooning whale sounds much cooler stealing money ey 100% team's fuckup quadratic multiple snaps etc want fix second prop
332460,atom ico ethbtc several years ago icf still holds 1b btc eth think unlikely juno born 2021 devs would spent fortune gamingbuying atoms receive larger allocation could increased team allocation imo fair stakedrop distribution atom community reference 50k atom 400k usd time snapshot airdropdistribuition whale friendly cap 400k usd juno vc investors distribuition 100% via stakedrop
332461,making assumptions nothing creating cartel
332462,50kaddress either extremely dumb extremely convenient seem dumb
332463,feigning dumb though works
332464,assumption team owns tokens atom ico 2017 juno born 2021 distribuition atom stakers dev team got 25% tokens
332465,plebs voted kill gamerwhale c'est la vie
332466,claim anyone putting effort equalize bad whale put effort find really 25%
332467,25% get together form cartel never lose vote voted carry
332469,new ideas things improve chains trash sure sometimes good idea mix somewhere ultimately improve space
332475,real question isnt even whether whale bad actor discovered bad actor significant stake chain reason modify chain eliminate bad actor imo giving integrity chain way harmful potential bad actor large controlling stake chain ethereum parity hack contensious feel different reasons set precident like would illegal act due critical bug much room malisciousness
332476,whats quite funny debo validator controlled whale admitted description let's exit scam noticed back long juno launched whale said bad english thought meant let's get rid scammersor something effect seem odd maliscious entity attempting fly radar would write knowing actually means also consolidate accounts conscpicously chain
332477,parity hack iirc big bone contention fact community refused refund devopsfans accidental kill stuff
332478,fact called hack
332479,sorry referring killing contracts event obviously term parity hack mind obviously actual hack stealing funds different event referring
332480,meant one tbh
332481,actually seems like needed brush ethereum history fact confused dao hack hard fork subsequent parity smart contract bug part event either way point still stands oh drama
332483,guess mutant punks decomposed meebits airdrops soon 
332484,

332527,oh awesome
332528,good project
332529,either good network great background previous exits good selling pitches
332530,ofcourse that's leaving job build
332531,selling pitches
332532,dont know anybody true builder raise know stupid vc shits spending value marketing delivering product archive top 100 mcap
332533,honestly hypothetical question want know decide go route prepared

332537,im still dont get wrong good wonder ever part 3
332538,lots ppl cna help find investors
332539,anyone predictions fees eth l1 2 years would 100 gwei less
332540,2 years txs probably l2s
332541,yeh would fees l1
332542,btw could move l2s already adoption growing
332543,yeah idk man that's pretty open ended question depends much industry sobers moves back ethit's l2s
332544,zksync 20 launch year hopefully gets lot tvl lot capital still jumping across chains yield farming
332545,chip game classical pattern adoption happens slowly
332546,l2s launched midlate last year give time
332547,hi example nft pdf file recommend would best create nft 
332548,way done media upload ipfs wherever prefer put linkhash token
332549,agreed move specific l2 like make vote protocols tvl go weigh votes tvl
332550,thanks opensea user able browse pdf pages
332551,opensea since afaik support web app link pdf visible
332552,can't one else always come new ponzi attract users l2 also also hinder progress want multiple l2's best one win
332553,kind want multiple l2's way see multiple l2's dedicated specific functionality way go solving cross l2 liquidity solved way mandating everyone use one specific l2
332554,anyone playing hermes launch metis
332555,ohm fork
332556,
332557,bridge use
332558,yeah token maia hermes like solid question better dump rewards accumulate delegate vote
332559,official one metis
332560,
332561,think solve cross chain liquidity without fragmenting
332562,agree non trivial however interesting work done starkware interesting proposal dammm uniswap new auto router sources liquidity mainnet l2 albeit alot offchain infrastructure 
332563,hope we'll see amm also integrates l1s like fantom
332564, someone getting away 300k saturday night heist

332568,list blockchain scaling papersscientific articles please share
332569,paraluni chinese scam
332570,several relevant 
332572,here's one steps outside blockchain box comparative angle though 
332573,
332574,saw dune dashboard l2 adoptions increasing
332575,that's lot gas oof happens minersstakers le l2 adopted much
332576,staking cost running node pretty low
332577,think l1 eth place institutional trader users move l2 ser
332578,realistically long term everything l2
332579,kinda sad many scams chinese bsc
332580,make eth less valuable
332581,l2s still complete blockspace since transacting l2 much efficient data stored onchain splitting l1 transaction fee potentially thousands transactions i'm fullblown expert though
332582,future finance truly decentralized ethereum takes cake even rollup technology goodies roadmap blockspace still premium
332583,
332584,hm ok one hand eth settles net amount blockspace demand would decrease assuming l2s facilitate new use cases expand addressable market that's offsetting tailwind blockspace demand
332585,l2beatcom
332586,whats biggest impediment univ3 lps collateral
332587,maybe collateralization ratio 
332588,duality fi literally working polygon ser
332589,wait wut pls dm
332590,yeah feel ftee

332592,ah ye one
332593,aoki active still

332596,polygon goes
332598,dust attack
332601,hmm seems bug validator
332606,sup
332607,wondering dust attack could happen future txn cost low enough l2
332609,sight
332612,talk dust reminds dark materials thought dust attacks primarily targetted towards users rather bring network
332613,sounds true caused solana outage weeks ago
332614,bugs
332616,looks like ddos 
332617,several outages sure basically one time due communcation validators designed one got clogged started forwarding inbound messages others increasing load network call ddos nodes ddosing caused 2 day outage recall correctly article says hit ddos goes say 'speaking cointelegraph austin federa head communications solana labs clarified recent outage came number transactions ido landed solana block took excessive amount compute power federa added compute kinds transactions wasnt properly metered network caused blocks take much longer process network expected pointed however network go point always independently verified adding ' sound like ddos issues
332618,thanks clarifying looking
332619,single nft mint magiceden majority solana bullishness hear institutions prop desksmm's actually bullish tech allow use strats function high freq low fee environment holding heavy bags interested hear educated thoughts also seems essentially recruiting junior devs shoving rust solana throat isnt going produce much quality least short term sounds like lot pain tbh
332620,really bring question solanas scalability single dash crash anyone looked performance take consensus messages
332621,ftm technically faster cheaper yet convinced solana scales better way reported tps actually intranode communication goodput
332623,even winning english dude
332624,institutionally scammed
332625,would love see another defi wave
332626,who's yet join 
332627,thats interesting intranode communication counted tps official stats intranode communication chain tho really reporting chain messaging counting toward tps anywhere read
332628,think chain part concensus add real info inflates numbers looks much better
332629,understanding validation chain gets coined
332630,took screenshot last outage witnessed solana began magiceden whitelisted 10k pfp sellout beginning funny timing also note far quoted high tps capabilities prior event imagine probably got hit max 23x amount txs atthe startof mint pure speculation numbers still way called capabilities gas fees dont increase drastically liveness seems major issue significant load
332631,perhaps due proof history timestamping consensys mechanism glancing docs thats come
332632,works fine
332633, useful someone wants fund zk wallet gitcoin grant directly polygon avoiding mainnet fees try personally dyor still alpha works eth check discord support fin

332689,research question remember hype around alternatives amm dexes one alternative pmm proactive market making idea simple instead simple invariant like cpmm xyc models using oracles price feed mid price customized slippage formula checked cpmm traction 99% stablecoin pools dodo dex example question models dont work arbitrage attacks possible cpmm pools stablecoin pairs
332690,guys trivial google question fin discussion cause beginner privacy opsec stuff tbh barely anyone making big deals millions criminal stuff dont paranoid buying coins friends
332691,fin telegram whatsapp
332692,think problem need oracles obscure markets compete uniswap
332693,wen nodes oracles
332695,sure actually many oracles using lending protocols huge sector defi im interesting research articles arbitrage models cpmm pmm seems like arbitrageurs making risk free profits one pool pmm certain peg amm hasnt somebody paying arbitrage draining liquidity pmm pool im playing numerical models kinda time consuming anyone knows research articles topics please share ps asymmetry industry new hype models hard finds critical research issuesattack vectors protocols
332696,widely used alternative oracles chainlink
332697,afa i've seen either something finagling earliermentioned unixswap chainlink looking take chances
332698,next closest probably band that's proven reliable least year ago
332699,two types chainlink usage 1 official price feeds trust limited number oracles partners link 2 custom dons decentralized oracles networks tbh see difficulties use link oracles open source infrastructure projects able support price feeds build dons ocr 20 validators able support several data feeds projects even dont forced use link nodes use ecaggregatorproxy interface oracles sure question somehow relevant devs btw question pmm amm arbitrage attacks reason pmf pmm moment
332700,lolol remember coinmarketcap went batshit band used feed ppl got liquidated stablecoin positionsd
332702,building oracle otherwise robust exactly trivial practical many cases brings back initial problem nick mentioned
332703,oracles issue lending protocols
332704,said earlier use chainlink one datachainlink adventurous ones finagle something unixswap
332705,still disabled
332706,rarely issue first limited support already second gives everything xswap i'm pretty sure that's oraclebased exploits come
332707,works
332708,thx
332709,defi researchers great summary article different amm models
332710,
332713,going stuff past week 
332714,surprising word solidly type model isnt
332715,dont know much solidly idk
332716,thought thread pretty good
332717,george wosmongton wosmongton tweeted future social consensus validators making final call better approach popular vote complex decisions congress chain product govern produce extent already gov module 13 
332718,gov things
332719,follow application congress blockchain governance system surely validators executive ability final say congress votes things executive tries put practice admittedly big input follow guy's train thought
332720,seems response certainly interesting seeing pos gov challeges coming surface maturing arguably decentralized pos consensys ecosystem ibc enabled interesting dynamics play especially since merge ethereum approaching
332722,dex protocol trade futures expiry
332723,synfuture
332724,use options
332725,what's good source checking tokens historical mc tlv etc
332726,example simple front running bot python somewhere
332729,interesting would amazing scaled orderbook futures dexes likely zks
332730,uhft guys optimising assembly dont think python would able scale check web3py sdk flashbots
332731,futures kinda hard scale asset intense verses perps
332732,defined liability platform need lock away assets perp relatively efficient
332733,yes thats probably perps able scale least extent vs futures
332735,true thanks ser case issue wouldnt applicable

332744,algo vs kwon
332745,odds algos side 
332746,guess prove point damn lol odds aint great
332747,algos side bearish luna position lower usd price 1 year
332748,yeah
332749,really unfair kwon
332750,think ser 
332751,best knowledges stable algo
332752,interesting respect putting lot luna 1 year could end looking like legendary sbf sell sol 3 bet
332753,assume marketing ploy sure kwon justify 1mil hype dies
332754,sbf bet everything run
332755,dont think algo bad look luna long time
332756,mean could founder project confident grow lot next year i'm personally confident fxs price higher 1 year well see unreasonable confident luna would 1 year
332757,well luna peeps saying easiest money kwon ever make knows either moon 0 imo
332758,story sol back sol still small luna gigantic
332759,algo saying fundamentals shit basically bet future price price fundamentals luna price shit due macro environment fundamentals
332760,luna close ath
332761,luna already crazy run
332762,maybe bet would fair said ust would touch x amount
332763,could buysell 1mln futures without flexing making event bet
332764,true think founder thinking simply like project grow price right today easier see that's reasonable bet perspective guy that's charge project
332765,hedge bet short although doubt would miss 1mln much
332766,true
332767,actually interesting bet imo supply growth different indicator altogether wonder supply top decentralized stablecoins 1 year dai ust frax
332768,major chains solidly clone
332769,smaller fucked 
332770,haha definitely smaller wonder much larger decentralized ones 100s billions growth taper become linear 
332771,current macro conditions liquidity drying scenario 2 likely opinion
332772,betting adoptions algo stable could stable
332773,us gov make illegal accep block coinjoin transactions ie miner get coinbaseprofit blocks gets guilty
332774,make anything illegal c

332936,cant use bc im american
332937,hey guys shared thoughts correct hopefully apy calculation 2token portfolios think univ3 univ2 curve etc id love hear thoughts anyone whos interested topic 
332938,gelato whale pool unlocking
332939,guni spinoff
332940,arrakis
332941,proposing staking gel holders 
332942,hearing gelato's unlock limited ui
332943,actually unlocked chain
332944,people claiming dumping
332945,frontrunning ui unlock
332946,gets 85% tokens
332947,doesnt seem fair make new token really key product couple months raise
332948,oh shit really
332949,someone ping gelato team
332950,lol
332951,send tx
332952,lol wtf
332953,see
332954,supersniping mev bots
332955,think that's true least can't see anything unusual looking gel token etherscan
332956,found
332957,here's
332958,
332959,contacting
332961,thats oka tho plus minus two hours cares
332962,issue fact splitting dao
332963,lmao serious issues frontrunning dolphin token sale
332964,28% gel circulating right publicteam vesting tokens 472% supply relock they're competing 15% new token right
332965,
332967,conversion wrong
332969,see
332970,mmm would disagree second time
332971,mean doesnt change much people know automate claiming process would still faster sell tokens ig sucks even way
332972,kinda ironic way thats exact problem protocol trying solve bet users didnt use
332973,agree split feels way rushed
332974,claim misunderstanding moot point long term ppl gel holders better jump forum post
332975,gel peeps legit im sure good discussion go well
332976,reasons gave spin liquidity management solution stay neutral comparison given coinbase likely feels bsc ecosystem 
332977,went thru thread get coming there's non zero chance split could work long term rn im sure
332978,go thru weeks months discussions decision made case
332979,gnosis first made products funded internally making tokens
332980,feels like forcing good side dao dispersed new coin soon
332981,lets honest founder making new coin worse founder 10 angel investments
332982,founders making new coins product stipulation i'd add onto new product building old necessitate new token product markedly different product new token bit ridiculous
332983,defidave3056 gitpusha unless r missing smth
332984,guni find strong pmf especially since uni v3 could get messy growing product line gelato focuses automation protocol infra anglebut gelato find strong pmf guni double edge sword guess
332985,lets honest depends anything
332986,everyone think npc somehow better
332987,defi learning tricks nft community
332988,nah nothing learn
332990,setting expectations ahead new product lines important product may token depending successful original token holders benefit product thoroughly umbrella never token product entirely separate original product totally separate raise longer building x
332991,hey defi know fuck headed neither
332992,easy say hindsight imo things grow experiments next thing know ppl talking forming new dao token
332993,agree even mentioning might spin token project successful better showing blue new token done right additional tokens make lot sense avoid diluting core product building top done wrong people get confused communicated right
332995,understand math 50% gel holders team public lock get 15% new token seem fair longterm gel holders seems like attempt stop gel nuking dilutes 7x upcoming unlocks everyone getting taste today gel holders even get revenue product totally get ethnical considerations tokenomics frightening
332996,whenever ship new feature i'll make sure state said feature might might spin token future
332998,ser wen dai2
332999,sir wen dai first decides kid guess
333000,sai mcd 
333001,ham
333002,hey full disclosure dont work fulltime gelato anymore opinion opinion alone said leading growth almost year honestly say makes lot sense spin guni project business development outreach guni much different flow standard automation use cases use cases tasks fulfilled gelato bots guni much akin app built top gelato network making project gives lot flexibility grow evolve rather merely stayed internal project since launched 8 months ago
333003,tfw side project becomes side
333004,
333005,tbh imagine future builders create gelatonative apps like arrakis dont know yet 
333006,cool must awkward position parent project future
333007,announced kiln today next hopefully last new merge testnet itd great teams run full deployment make sure things work expected want sure toolinginfra beyond actual contracts works expected postmerge context want run transition expected around wednesday info 
333008,ty darrenlautf featuring checking tg channel literally daily quite cool see tweet thread featured also keep great work 
333009,
333010,bad actually
333011,agree think that's main reason one initial usecase growth strong time generic protocol would say demonstrates gelato good potential could done gelato team instead spinoff
333012,little afaics least without gimping spinoff favor gelato people going complain either way
333013,hm built team funded vcs money token holders' money spinoff new product new token i'm one sees conflict interest straightforward fraud
333014,see conflict interest andor straightforward fraud iiuc spice future token yet defined
333015,fraud literally trying isolate different project parent company something different grow project team least trying align incentives among old new token holders
333016,understood gel holders receive large part spice supply
333017,15%
333018,spice supply hehe
333019,think general counter argument gelato offering originally came market especially governance token decision needs go community theory
333020,think actually beauty web3 tokens general form smaller isolated communities around specific projects governance concerned particular issue rather mixing many concerns
333021,raised money build product x team paid build product x instead building product x ended completely new product new tokenbuilt using money raised built product x how's fraud
333022,people raised get tokens product x
333023,understanding happen attached newsletter sent evening
333024,gel holder tokens understood correctly
333025,isnt best worlds
333026,depends course many tokens get new project
333027,well magdalena get part 15%
333028,considering number final
333029,current supply gel 13889847 september know exact date unlock increase circulating supply 87293175 that's 63x dilution millions unlocked today
333030,adrianleb said ivangbi best place discuss community forum 
333031,lock token year get mere 15% vested 4 years lol
333032,question 15% spice tokens worth spice gets project vs spice remain inside gelato correct
333033,ask everything 
333034,agree hard define definitely risky move
333035,see work big fan hyper focused teams narratives
333036,mere crypto gone head 
333037,also would incentive gelato developers actually spin project dont believe would make better proposal says get vested 24 years hardly exit scam spice
333038,vested 4 years team liquid gel holders lock get instantly upfront

333134,check wealthy expat youtube talks bunch cashing dubai believe recommends coinfera found good crypto meetups dubai awhile seen much besides metaverse event seemed bit corporate even regular expat meetup group would fun
333135, community organizing defi dubai every friday

333140,sers dubai expat group
333141,right 
333142,good advice tho keep

333145,
333146,according document yuga made cool 127 million net revenue last year figure projects reach 455 million 2022 chiefly proceeds virtual land sales
333148,fyi crunched numbers gelspice thingy recent dilution 15x sep 2022 diuation 5x assuming one locks gel sep 2023 dilution enormous tokens lock spice long term dilution 5x 5x september 2022 25x current valuation spice dilution little 3x assuming public private team members lock gelato community holds 25% tokens around 75% spice likely far worse small holders whales farm liq mining spice supply whyjpeg
333149,gelato chat
333150,onpoint convo seem criticizing move shilling
333151,regards sep 2023 point got twitter space time lock 3 months assume unlock occur one day dilution equal number tokens locked i'm really sure could called dilution
333152,afaik want lock spice forced lock gel could go half half sell 'investor' unlock 6 months time
333153,abearrug
333154,care share maths
333156,
333157,4% gel circulating public private 21% gel team 25% gel people 50% gel get stab 15% spice meaning public private get 75% spice gelato team gets 75% spice plan goes forward gel unlocks 2022 lessened they'll even bigger 2023 spice community members get first dibs liq mining whales get
333158,that's skinny version
333159,anyways trying debate that's proposal confusing first came offering layman terms gel holders
333160,think reading wrong understandign gel team private sale investors still locked start unlock 6 months token holders get 15% spice people unlocked tokens ie 4% bought community token sale whales dolphins community devs rewardees funds used
333163,appreciate response i'm definitely fence correct rather wanna get different perspective couple things everyone locks gel airdrop pushes sept 2022 cliff forward expect 5x dilution somewhere first half 2023 sept 2023 another unlock investors team though team token already started linear vesting first unlock spice part i'm homework numbers yet though concur whales advantage similar almost cases tbh
333164,semantics indeed misinterpreted
333165, utilizing uniswap v3 create buy wall essentially prevents token price dumping risky sounds good true next level token price editing
333166,neverdumpswap 
333167,ah case since locked allocation extend vest order take part locked allocation unlocked seems like public could easily get less 75% also depends whether locked investors partial spicelock

333227,behind lyra hearing every second team liking surprised
333228,imagine options chain get liquidated chain stops working
333229,wait imagine borrowinglendingoptions sol get burned
333235,exactly saying would liquidated conditions
333236,decay whatever called options
333237,would imply chain goes extended period time daysweeksmonths whereby option closes oom also liquidation option closing oom technically occur one could quite easily hedge position perps another options exchange
333238,would say biggest risk would lps case chain delta hedging engine would impactful would need coincide extreme market price swing well impact would depend open option contracts according lyra docs without delta hedging likely lps would extremely net short hurt lps would likely need coincide massive move underlying events lined lps incurred significant loss also security pool l1 considerable amount usdc lyra would used compensate lps
333239,also think chain going extended period time would larger consequences one options platform

333519,experiences olympus pro 
333520,47% tokens treasury 15% nft holders 38% bayc founders yuga labs launch contributors 38% control majority votes true dao
333521,bancor certainly looks interesting there's fei protocol owned liquidity thing merit afaics work well something sell another project bribes mercenary dumps seems like better generic lm
333524,mean ok 38 73% treasury tokens also one entity also case many daos look defi 
333525,24 yuga bayc founders alone people
333526,also bayc holders giving apes soon tkens away discord maybe smart good security
333527,dont know doubt one company recently investment round ne founders two different things imho
333528,yuga raised money minor part company shares implies bayc founders still 80% yuga labs best part web3 initial launch cex 
333529,fair anyway dont want defend ape coin think weird gripe many distro
333530,completely agree
333531,least distro better coinlist tokens sell 05% tokens community dao think good enough unless voting rights dump incoming unlock

333552,hey guys founded tfmcom launched 1inch terra save 100s even 1000s every trade terra since liquidity split across 3 dex excited see community save course open feedback
333553,havent able find portals functionality new v3 ui
333564,yeah frig spam
333565,thank guys deleted spam banned spammers ping see 
333567,anyone heard arable blacklisting accounts selling staking rewards
333568,yah crazy shit arable said blacklist bots apparently blacklisted normal account selling yields thats blockchain abt
333569,goeth121
333570,infra would take make easy run local version etherscan could done js browser would need ur case
333571,check otterscan
333572,apparently double freezing guy trying get attention dev treat seriously like wtf defi get blacklisted early selling yield
333573,archive node
333575,checkout otterscan recently found lobster
333576,otterscan erigon
333577,whats deal erigon thing
333578,faster storage efficient eth client
333579,personally 512 gb laptop
333580,also akula sure ready yet
333581,akula take 1tb
333582,basicly need ssd
333583,ssds quite reasonably priced days anyway probably get 2tb ssds 150
333584,best 4tb one would recommend
333585,uses erigon's data model pruned state 600 gb think
333586,archive nodes also index events think asked around 1tb u use zfs
333587,hmm yeah sounds right
333589,wow thats awesome
333593,sooo whos gonna start lobsters dubai
333597,saw tweet screenshot dev threatening victim go social complian
333599,ivangbi
333600,arable protocol blacklisted potential bots quick sellers here's full article anyone knows way help appreciated want people falling prey especially incentivised lobsterdao members stay safe spread word
333601,goeth121 please explain sir important
333602,wow pretty wild first time hearing projects blacklisting people farm dumping tokens
333603,sounds pretty serious thanks update look removing funds well meanwhile hope dev goeth121 steps forward explain idea protecting protocol blacklisting traders okay community pretty odd ask
333604,didnt know function inbuilt shady af
333607,seem really really scared sell button
333608,continue blacklist addresses hodls acre 
333611,guys anyone idea good oracle solutions apart chainlink chainlink solution seems costly small projects
333612,band
333613,uni v3 free
333614,
333615,chains metis l2 one solidly fork
333616,
333617,pay much terms gas cost cardinality oracles vpepo lived experience
333618,think that's really true tbh activating lending market euler 144 cardinality 30 minute twap ranged 2002000 usd depending gas costs thereafter almost cost chainlink oracles cost upto 1m month gas fees alone update chain gas fees high prices volatile
333619,exists secret society right two members postpone plan meeting evry week exists
333620,allowed say
333621,sourcex 
333622,secretive even members dont know part
333624,joel ms joel
333625,pyth
333627,29 prs new one think anyone would going defi papers together maybe like little book club i've summarising papers decentralised collab well daoistrycom also fundraising gitcoin i'm putting reading group together share highlights summaries
333628,might offpiste found old post oracle mechanisms interesting 
333629,wait that's true accounting quotes need order get twap initialization
333630,quoting univ3 costs 60k gas interaction i'm sure euler uses quotes expensive cost transferred user
333631,reference i'm pro univ3 oracles p statement kinda tricky make
333632,yes that's fair there's cross contract call computation let check gas estimates though would still contend net cost uni v3 oracle much much cheaper 3rd party provider would interesting see research
333633,imho straight forward example would seeing comparison ens using chainlink current vs using univ3 quoting pricing
333634,reference could create much efficient chainlink style oracle uniswap v3's oracle
333635,chainlink choose subsidise oracle costs short term entirely fair comparison opinion
333636,thing chainlink chainlink's holders pays whole party uniswap v3 user pay drink
333637,reference also like chainlink's oracles there's clear tradeoffs two
333638,yep depends usage could cache uniswap quote reuse sufficient demand
333639,btw euler use quoting univ3 interaction borrow lending
333640,view chainlink unifying oracle bring enterprises use defi well
333641,that's chainlink's moat
333642,chainlink quoting ens registration 6k gas 10x less vs univ3 quoting
333643,tool
333644,interesting arrive enterprise partners oracle data providers
333645,tenderly
333646,let's see happens make users pay usage
333647,
333648,yep pretty much optimise parts caching though euler build batch transactions deposit multiple assets borrow multiple assets take longshort position mint leverage etc etc single batch transaction ui save tonne gas
333649,true 1 quote vs 10 interactions
333650,that's really cool design tbh
333651,thanks 
333652,launch oracles pay bit issue teams
333653,precisely enterprise middleware market hugely untapped
333654,hood generalised flash loan function allows users borrow something without collateral combination complex legal operations simply defer checks liquidity status end batch switch back check protocol user
333655,keep3r oracle maintaining something like 40 feeds cost 100k range monthly
333656,wen lobster eli5 euler session
333657,every team 100k throw maintaining feeds
333658,1
333660,michael twitter space
333661,tbh michael quite active open questions 3 would say long term eli5 p
333662,try get free tokens peace
333663,wdym costly
333664,yup eulermab kul 
333665,time sir ask away we'll start twitter spaces etc next week we've audit back week ready move forward stuff
333666,euler community call monday 5 pm utc
333667,may news eul call
333669,fun fact borrowing euler would cheaper aave v3 use univ3 oracle tradeoff accepting long tail assets vs limit chainlink's asset list
333670,tenderly sooo good
333671,guys considered multiple oracle setup something like like using univ3 default governanceenabled switch well established coins tenderly example usdc borrow could switch chainlink provider
333672,interesting stuff oxmikko apeir99n
333673,yes may still go way focussed shipping something minimises governance ultimately governance could vote alternative
333674,shill time frens already protocol feel free check whenever guys start going route p
333675,oh know mean finance guys already talked uni v3 oracle manipulation costs actually working something similar tool 
333677,thanks sharing ur story read ur twitter screenshot unfair us investors whats naturally normal
333678,actions seen f scammy arable side wasnt vetted lobsterdao case someone says airdrop quite nice give however lets turn context oh us poor investors u r gamblers thats bit plebbish still shit decision w blacklists 
333679,layer 0 thing never heard
333681,primordialaa chad behind interoperability novel tbh mabye expand bit
333682,please everyone talking twitter since yesterday would nice get info source 
333684,14k gas iirc recent ahem cruft they've added api still practically nothing compared xswap

333686,useful resources website layerzeronetwork discord medium post great high level overview demo 
333687,theres also stargate finance launches today built layerzero labs stargatefinance 
333688,naive question what's difference rune layer zero trying solve problem
333689,rune uses txorigin
333690,defiant also posted video layerzero months ago
333691,serious note article classifies rune middle chain authority delegated middle chain central point failure layer zero proposes ultra light node security guarantees running light client chains secure middle chain also expensive
333692,layerzero underlying messaging protocol maybe better compare stargate good describing trade offs architecting bridges 
333693,cool thanks

333766,paper mind sharing
333768,ser see convo yes oke double post one cool post
333769,layerzero
333770,say take chainlink coinbasesushiuniswapaavecompoundlidoetc relayer security would take lambda oracle malicious relayer security end user one always picking wants use similar rpc endpoint metamask mitigate risk aspect 
333771,outcomes basically honest honest honest dishonest dishonest honest dishonest dishonest case relayer oracle honest transaction validated onchain forwarded destination application case oracle honest relayer dishonest fails validate oracle dishonest relayer honest fails validate case malaction case oracle relayer active malicious collusion together means first say example choose chainlink oracle means malicious action first predicated defeating chainlink meaning worst case case relayer fully colluding oracle still reduces secure oracle second thing even extreme case malicious oracle colluding directly relayer say relayer risk 100% siloed oracle relayer pairing anybody using relayer bz unaffected anybody relaying tx unaffected anybody using oracle bz unaffected
333772,primordial maki explanation tldr one made understand
333773,thank makes easier 
333774,
333775,
333777,always trying tone dont lose anyone thought process siloed aspect important understand

333789,correct
333790,strategists get paid big dollars fun things they're bigbrain get automated yearn needs retain top talent continue grow
333791,kk makes sense would simplest example strategy
333792,take eth go aave deposit borrow
333793, read
333794,ah see okay essentially yv tokens like uni v2 lp tokens determines portion tokens vault earn via withdrawing tokens pool size pie grows
333795,anyone big dapps like uni curve etc use graph procotol speak thoughts migration graph's decentralized service like users willing pay assess speed things moving
333796,
333797,interesting stuff actually
333798,interesting bit complicated explanations need ir swaps soon tm

334013,maybe shouldnt launched meme high apr staking farm worried people dumping staking rewards anyway think community clear give guy funds back rethink approach
334015,even bother launching token mvp youre afraid market might well work mvp first
334016,dumping coin hurt protocol health
334017,substitute protocol health price value team tokens kek
334018,ontario residents restricted using binance platform link
334019, ontario securities commission sparring binance
334020,make mistake tokenomics mechanism decisions abusing protocol could correct i'm opinion suffer consequences failure mechanism design valid reason forgo principles industry contractually obligated sell that's different matter dude using system intended stopping hurts bottom line that's incredibly unethical probably illegal
334021,principles lol time time agen u trust nonanon devs
334023,arable convos permitted behavior end malicious rather negligent one see expressed unilaterally fin
334024,tldr
334025,quickly understanding expert takes notion evm precompiles adds state access allowing functionality devs diminish gas cost etc
334032,good tldr stateful precompiles modify balances readwrite storage contracts could even hook external storage outside bounds evms merkle trie
334033,bad tldr
334034,reiterate dangerous capability used carefully developer builds nondeterministic stateful precompile execution modified evm naturally nondeterministic could result different validators disagreeing whether block valid
334035,looks neat engineering trickery perspective also looks like disaster waiting happen regarding intentional unintentional exploits
334036,someone interested bean interesting design
334038,interesting think search previous mentions
334039,enlighten us
334040,
334041,would y'all like share find interesting refer docs asked
334042,hey responding said enlighten us think bean money talk hardly understand lol i'm bot promote
334043,that's im asking trhx01 enlighten us finds interesting design learn
334045,like bean tbh pod line ponzish
334046,supply flat months see dune means people stuck line realize yield new seniorage seems there's demand
334047,concept trading pod interesting overlyconfident sowed line already super booked thank still exit discount
334048,agree need increase demandusage challenge stablecoin facing integration trust public
334051,whats interesting completely autonomous design decentralized stable coin
334053, looks like participated bonded curves option buy 25
334054,money raised right
334055,already 80mm protocol owned liquidity yes
334056,money bridge bridges
334057,cant blame due fact need fkload capital bootstrap heavy usage right quite capital intensive amms imho hard protocols
334058,
334059,arca proposal must dumbest sure know proposal date surprised would thing tbh
334061,guys use metamask ledger anyone else signing bug like 100 times works work arounds
334062,silly think actual answer got huge discount way wed lose money glad cleared 
334063,web3defi developer centric podcasts
334071,zero knowledge good much defi though
334072,earlier true wider variety though tarun sunny osmosis couple times tarun actually co hosts
334073,1 year lockup followed 6 months linear vesting moneys getting rekt eventually
334075,happened quite bit zapper days ago nowhere else
334076,thats solid current buyers also still depends valuation got
334077,btw neither criticism layer0 particular knowledge situation found ironic ginormous twitter thread know actual answer thought could make money going pre public sale also fair chance selling enough locked tokens secondary market rather well even price crashes
334078,damn people actually read whole thing
334079,honestly would inclined read posted link article
334083,beans trades 1 we're state equilibrium happens beans trades 1 'depeg' event case incentivize buying beans debt 1 beans 1 beanstalk issues debt promising pay people back beans future promise sound like something scales
334084,basis dollar something
334085,yeah sounds like bond part basisio
334086,anyone knows app zap eth univ3 ntf one tx
334087,i've seen can't remember
334088,beans sound like complete nonsense would strongly advise getting involved
334089,elaborate
334090,understand basically printing money collateral liquidity reasonable would provide liquidity decentralization ain't big enough aspect compared risk going 0 compared usdc usdt imo
334091,read wp earlier understanding print money demandthat's token crosses peg think key differentiator earlier ponzi designs collapsed weight way incentivize longterm liquidity also interestingyour share new minting somewhat depended long lp think pretty interesting purely relies economic incentivizes fully convinced easily scale think collapse debt print tokens unless peg
334092,way look investors essentially funding public goods optimism structured pbc meaning obligation privilege shareholder profit public good funding i'm pleb seems leadership determined make sure community benefits investor course believe two mutually exclusive already gave 1m fund open source projects zk vs optimistic rollup like people believe see thread technical take 
334093,investors financial gain
334094,want benefit make sure community benefits first via public goods
334095,think speak lot ppl want take significant part dao think ppl deserving valuable ur investors we've long personally 9 years hurts see vcs valley started take interest last years come eat lunch critical part crypto ecosystem especially one best branding team
334096,wait see 
334097,think ppl deserving valuable ur investors personal curiosity
334098,cuz need access vc give literally dm anyone industry they'll answer u especially ur optimism
334099,the're product already pmf like vcs going give useful advice u find chat group know less web 30 ppl
334100,survivorship bias people care ones never got clout reach point
334101,understand
334102,
334103,we're talking optimism taking vc money specificly
334104,justification survived therefore need vcs
334105,we're talking specific case
334106,heh carry
334108,crv
334111,hi degens i've one question apecoin flashloan put bayc token instead nft first step think could pay fee putting bayc token instead nft
334112,need ask questions someone using coinbase frequently dm could help understand things
334114,founders care ape investment forget project development
334115,going strong enough feeling setup people building forget factor powerful effect people wanting buy stuff going catching knives
334116,potential options 1 could add gamified element peg buying hooks dopamine loop 2 consider single sided staking break lps get price appreciation back peg 3 time build chain l2 built think get traction build rev generating product use finds buy back peg token remember order peg token last needs attractive potential investors whatever pegged combo aggregate incentives utility brand speculation
334117,hi guys searching aptos alpha bout
334118,anyone know party trade crypto relief fund reportedly traded usdc usd 
334120,ig didnt really trade anyone redeemed usdc usd
334121,degenbet moment give money protocol sow pay back 70 times bet weather wait turn seems give wait protocol issued 14b bean
334122,likely never going happen people reasonable
334123,people reasonable 
334124,also buy existing protocol debt x cents others holding debt liquid market debt actually changes hands
334125,also sowing right reasonable thing dont understand people price oscillating around 1 means either single side stake token lp
334126,single sided staking already
334127,really like single sided staking
334128,
334129,
334130,cant argue much w tbh 
334131,doc shit
334132,bridge project doesnt support crosschain transfer token lol
334133,taking money randoms internet huge regulatory overhead company that's go anon dao
334134,hello guys best resource beginner learn protocols like yearn balancer curve want learn much many topics coins tokens finding difficult start resources beginners advanced point view someone wants learn everything crypto
334135,please help guide best resources
334136,go read docs gitbook see youtube vieos finematics whiteboard crypto justin bram content try consume things start making sense watch 99% youtube shilling scams
334137,believe actually going enabled today
334138,seen finematics videos understood beginning end wants list best resources read
334139,seems scattered
334140,finding best resource taking time learning

334152,mad dont take lobsters pool
334153,lolll
334154,yes forget stg tokens adding liquidity using bridge farming zro tokens airdrop maybe
334155,checked noticed mkr collateral dai hard find answer mkr can't collateral dai anyone knows forum back debt equity trick reason
334156,reason yes
334158,thanks ivan
334159,alexcrowme members posting educating helping merits publicly twitter already lengthy discussions trying steer thx
334160,time snx collateralized susd cdp algo low iq pleb sorry spamming q curious allowed defi thanks
334161,maker careful sometimes called boomer might completely right finance rules wise say play 100 year old rule book whereas fed even degen crypto protocol
334162,thanks ivan recent discussions maker forum also informative topic
334163,downward spiral risk things goes bad incentive design mkr holders deal risk parameters less focus governance mkr token holders
334164,mean
334165,really buying gov token holders incentive cause 90% always random holders system governed good wellmeaning elite technically ye right kind ser
334166,mkr holders voting raise stability fee mkr vaults would fun debate watch least
334167,100% sticking point mind ive wondered would feasible tie repegging mechanism entirely separate robust project somehow correlated first one could participate helping repeg without overcommit protocol might death spiral
334168,getting people commit utility without question wen next hotness
334169,second one option mean
334170,makes sense gas cheap though thanks bulls taking rest
334171,solana sir 
334172,thanks sir
334173,
334174,damn bribes winning
334178,
334179,damn maker becoming degen
334180,ellipsis v2 coming guys see 
334181,forking curve v2
334182,musings needed mechanism similar ampleforth supply contracts peg hedge fund managers benevolent whales persons revenue streams treasury extra yield new users piling
334183, new ellipsis 
334184,wait llama
334185,possible someone's first transaction across chain receive fund synapse bridge
334186,can't wait ldo rpl bribes curve stethrocketpooleth
334187,anybody knows ape mevor used nft instead bayc token actually could buy bayc token flashloan fee
334188,
334189,mean exactly synapse define destination address ie using addy bridge different change send addy b
334190,yea guess didnt see information logs transaction maybe missed use syn api shows initiated transaction
334191,avax tx gohm look input data first topic 0 shows address
334192,address obviously address initiated transfer
334193,
334194,looking transaction morning
334195,
334196,guys go decentralisedco give thumbs emoji loading
334197,
334199,ser
334200,decentralized stablecoin maxi group shipped fun tool token gating remove members community secretely holding centralized stablecoins unholy assets
334201,look tx initial chain find address transaction data event emitted synapse bridge contract fresh address funded gas tokens way mixer means everything easily traceable
334202,thank ended using synapse api like said super easy find originator great api way
334203,guys think vetokens next big trend like bonding 2021
334204,around hearing sleepy lumbering giants finally making moves platypus think best model power soulbound nontransferable make good governance
334207,pretty tokens predates bonding atleast year
334208,mean getting wide adoption
334209,vetokenomic adds sense governance tokens
334210,would argue platypus step back introduce called loyalty shares tradfi seems less efficient around
334212,hi sers anyone knows blockchains solana nomempool concept 
334213,see 914 tweets make supeleveraged
334214,hmm think iota tangle dag mempool concept
334215,really follow could wrong
334216,fav iota concept goes two weeksrevolutionary
334220,taxes depositing eth aave receiving aeth clearly tax laws least us dogshit yet apply defi get capital gain loss comes trading another token coin usd cex makes sense x got made gain loss comes platforms like aave yes eth smart contract received aeth 'marker' recepit never actually disposed eth since pks retrieve eth burn aeth looking lense 90 year old dinosaur congress see aeth looks like new token guys treat taxes actually law land defi wouldnt function imagine someone eth 2015 using thier assets get loan like people use stocks get loans tardfi massive capital gain bc got receipt token capital gain get usd didnt dispose 2015 eth
334221,treating deposit trade personally
334222,us tax laws insane w writeoff stuff capital gains calculations nightmare sorry hear suggest using blabla software getting accountant seek one gets made substantial amount sorry tax stuff wont discussed lobsters cause touched upon already good reply case case anyway cant say oh treat way ser anyway ctrlf tax convos previously want fin 
334223,i've gotten 3 different numbers 3 different accountants varying widely 
334224,nightmare bullshit done eventually make subjective decision path feel safe going aggressive planning super selfcucking thinking middle line every lawyer saying different indeed hard least europe non capital gains jurisdictions issue comes whether claim income investments authorities really treat anyway seek opinions want feel safer go nothing else
334225,late late long planning meet many 
334226,usually choose middle road one irs wants audit many wallets across 8 chains staking buying lping farming etc feel free
334227,lesson end day like ivangbi hold stables
334228,make work ya know
334229,trick ivan losing keys assets holding stables even fed holds stables thats big deal lost keys secret sauce
334230,guess one 
334233,redacted pardon kinda old thing already larping marketing meh get attention somehow else
334238,borrowed cash aapl stock got receipt banker trade aapl stock piece pvc paper realize capital gain get stocks back
334239,sorry might right might wrong nobody able judge turn shitstorm get consultant ask frens dms
334242,anyone tested rango exchange pretty surprised well worked i'm technical enough know made average compromises security perspective one feature would nice batch revoke button
334243,security attached productprotocolbridge used rango permisionless aggregator still sign tx wallet depending route ie take risk bridgedex rango using trade 14b volume security issuesfunds compromised would worry using product done countless tx issues except failed tx reverts funds back chain step also cancel tx process taking long call wallet tx bridging large amount would use bridge service suggest route directly ido coming soon rumors could copper albeit rango terra built lbp osmosis rangomarketing perhaps provide insight
334244,thank
334245,engagingfair style lbp way skyward built units claimable prorata basis average price block rather everyone subject prorata instantaneous snapshot last second event giving reason join last moments retain total optionality way get rewarded watching people choose participate whatever intervals valuation please anyone know that's like near
334247,think locke protocol working similarly essentially twap swap two tokens
334253,tool shows aprs uniswap lp pools
334254,revertfinance
334255,basically dca output balance tokens sold per period always input balance towards buying vary modifying effective final price completely oracleless one mentioned seems sort price reference
334256,literally overtime supplydemand sale mechanism
334257,ahhh gotcha
334258,i've collected tools may useful ya 
334259,appreciate
334260,thank 
334262,wrap secret tag owner see nft metadata public ye supposes owner gets secret password offchain
334263,sure seems nft tweet unlisted
334264,sounds like lot bs
334265,thank 
334266,something public key metamask guess potion nft well address mints reveal
334267,yes revealed secret anymore correct
334268,using opensea centralized server think set stuff minting
334269,encrypted anything trust opensea reveal holders ui
334270,meaning metadata encrypted kind pgp opensea decrypt pretty smart released service lots usecases even though os third party access secret can't used serious cases
334271,also doubt argicultor went kind headache lol
334273,gm everyone important questions regard pnd lobsterdao collection pieces want worth 10 eth floor minimum live discussion 
334274,
334275,oh fuck
334276,
334277,key point
334278, working encrypted nft content decentralized yet
334279,
334280,fixed income bit
334282,seems like windrathio feel free comment educate sers
334285,timeless
334286,yeh thinking
334287,explaination
334288,perp things
334290,really
334291,matter ethereum fees costs
334292,could create market starkex based dex 1000x volume way easier arbitrageable
334293,liquidity matters certain point lps see way profitable lp yt start issuing
334294,rebase things reduce gas cost
334295,ton layers complexity create liquid yield market
334296,still enter leveraged variable interest positions enter fixed rate positions everything reliant one liquidity pool instead two
334297,heres good point brought weeks ago
334298,
334300,
334301,0xngmi llama crew really incredible builders lives much easier thanks give gitcoin money 
334303,talking grants spare change community led tcg blockchain since 2020 
334304,also check grants maintained lobster dao members3 grant 
334305,sov's compendium approved grant well round curious anyone might able provide info get matching contributions setup
334306,hey sers sorry ask ive reading interoperability networks specifically connext layerzero wondering anyone conducted research around security know layerzero uses chain link oracles connext doesnt anyone resources look around
334307,thats able find help sir
334308,thanks ser check
334309,happy fill whatever gaps help however
334311,probably bit dirty word anyone know someone high hitbtc
334312,collection
334313,got locked account years ago swapped phones didnt back authenticator managed rekyc every cex aside really fkn hard work remember nice someone connection someone could help regain access ty
334314,yes sir 
334316,cool replied 'mine' 
334317,nice thanks request opt matching funds
334318,need update grant 'inactive' automagically start participating active matching rounds happening every quarter
334319,writing lot bridging systems oracle based solution considered less secure something like connext hop maybe arjunbhuptani enlighten specifically
334320,thanks lot ser would appreciated
334321,
334322,airdrop made many people rich
334323,really u joking
334324,paraswap level worse
334328,happy help good overview come blog post l0 externally verified model trust oracles relayer given tx collude connext otoh currently locally verified system similar atomic swap we're heading towards new still trustless security model i'll posting blog post early next week tho
334330,respectfully assumption external validators inherently insecure outdated mpc networks thousands nodes run entirely tees node access secret shares security model plus extensibility bitcoin nonevm support generalizability generic messaging thirdparty contract layer external validators solves trilemma
334331,cc philippzentner
334332,question balancer nearly pools two three tokens reading whole idea seems 8pools theres 1 active one
334333,arent consolidated concentrate liquidity
334335,really outdated economic security mpc system always economic security mpc validator set fundamentally distinct security underlying chains academic definition new trust assumption
334336,acceptable trust assumption iff economic security system greater underlying chains
334337,generally always false something like ethereum l1 tho
334338,i'm ramping solidity dev want tinker build apps want build semipublic goal meet cool likeminded people work ask questions anyone recs dev groups developer dao one i've heard far
334339,sure open new members right raid guild pretty great
334340,straw man youre assuming mpc networks secured economically custodial mpc network relies integrity secret shares secure funds funds cannot lost secret shares cannot compromised primary security concern liveness safety
334341,thank put application
334342,seems biggest problem using univ3 oracle long tail univ3 isnt available many chains univ2 available everywhere keydonix seems interesting solution need pass additional argument merkel proof call vpepo repos good oracle modules recommend check aside mean finance
334344,problem proof
334347,duplicate every single function relay oracle cant simply interact contracts without ui need generate proof
334348,seen using twap potential exploits idea chainlink costs insane useless small projectprotocols
334349,suggestion request timeout call contract abi calling method polygon keeps responding timeout rpc use 
334350,public rpc endpoint work request large block range timeout try infuraalchemy free tier paid plan reliable ofc
334352,thanks learned something new also forwarded research team look deeper different kinds mpc implementations
334353,hi guys think stargate significantly diminish role bridges like multi syn etc least major cross chain assets stable coins
334354,nope would
334355,especially synthetic asset bridges anyn tokens certain lock effect market complex different gtms niches focus etc
334356,amm defi integrated directly stargate via layer zero paper value proposition make bridges obselete agree kill bridges every assets stable coins majors like eth wbtc etc
334357,mean already plenty bridges connected major dex aggregators chain available top nomad axelar similar capabilities different security concepts advantages drawbacks target groups also wormhole generalized data messaging capabilities
334358,philipp interesting bridge aggregator view layer zero stargate 
334359,personal opinion educated enough yet im biggest fan oracle based solutions hosting one protocol even worse idea gonna aggregate stargate like assess grade security concept researchers theyll part stack sure general approach consult integration partner based needs target group volume sizes use cases frequency solutions whitelistblacklistprefer neutral sense
334360,arjuncrypto13 please let us know youve formed opinion one researchers
334361,thanks explaination would like see agruments experts
334362,thanks adding philipp
334363,surely looking l0 stargate 
334364,oxngmi exactly popular tellor missing 
334365,couldnt find protocols use main oracle
334366,ah makes sense often backup
334367,sorry offtrack make text effect called
334368,spoilers 
334369,many thanks 
334370,deprecated 
334371,issues dont look significant whats alternative long tail sidechains dont univ3 would greatly appreciate answer solidity devs actually used oracles theres significant gap perception oracles work practical code experience example many people know time weight average univ2 actively maintained via keeper might cost fortune chainlink even cheap sidechain
334372,i'm curious keydonix plausible option stumbled evidently without caveats fwiw uni v2 maintenance thing mentioned docs refers keydonix
334373,hi everyone need opinion advice subject want work crypto space mean get job earning special skill like solidity programmer degree marketing something think get job crypto currency mean way somebody like earn money
334374,yes try ama airdrop commod etc
334375,start community manager project translate materials test products support users products start learning programming solidity wish good luck learning also im suggesting finish convo since youre asking basic questions defi experienced audience discussions topics thanks
334377,degree start community projects develop skills contribute possible professionally assisting users proactive helping content taking every opportunity learn expect fail lot lot thankless shit modding community dev great way understand projects able understand project eventually people take notice figure good need
334378,would suggest learning javascript anything first go right solidity
334379,find opportunities i'm good programming really hard i'm trying learn slowly
334380,first basics js need front end metamask integration tests smart contracts deployment solidity use first ever tool
334381,kk thank tried little cryptozombies problems understanding references etc
334382,hi guys know site tracks crypto assets market cap positions throuhgout years know sites allow look positions certain date looking tool would put positions table visual graph
334383,like blockfolio
334384,hm use see changes mc positions see current mc positions
334385,trying formulate view longer market cycles crypto asset market cap longevity need see mc position top 100 tokens 2015 least
334386,check 
334387,thanks alex already familiar course use cmc need manually check month hoping tool would visually show mc positions changed years
334388,worries take huge cup coffee start fun google sheets 
334389,pretty simple ohlcv api surprised already google sheets integration
334390, might suitable use case
334391,app regarding info upcoming testnets
334392,kwon mentioning thorchain twitter spaces last night see monday native luna eth swap pool goes live thorswap wonder correlation
334393,said thorchain must battle tested first using terras btc reserves guess means add liq luna ust pools btc correct wrong pls
334394,
334395,cool thread pony la epolonye wtf handle posts interesting scalability stuff
334397,metis expensive eth l2 right isnt
334398,see also 
334399,reason metis intentionally omitted accident
334400,stunning profile pic supermassive blackhole banner thomas train follows optimism medium u guys seeing i'm seeing
334401,l2 preneding l2 basically fork oe token
334402,check many posts optimism pretty early zksync others fork fork vitaliks mom marketing maybe aint devs favorite wdyt huh
334403,idk real deal suggesting
334404,anything wrong ethereum fork
334405,asked conspiracy theory replied idk nothing continue fin
334406,whats best way send text based message say 1000 addresses eth whats cheapest way
334407,appreciate discussion regardless 
334408,criticism maybe rightfully pointed complete picture good
334409,use comments section etherscan
334411,oe stand
334412,optimistic ethereum
334413,metis make 2 things different technical point view believe played great role adoption apart token adding extra attention ofc added multiple sequencers optimism one made development permissionless launch
334414,dont look like significant improvements
334415,one message maybe send erc1155 token 
334416,text changed dynamically needed
334417,app automates 1000 addresses message like mail merge ethereum
334418,disqus might show captchas make 1000 comments one go
334419,yes main issue 1000 messages accounts spamming over9000 spammers evm chain eth address space use cheapest
334420,ftm pretty cheap tx according stat 
334421,platform potential give airdrop users
334422,
334423,hi possible revoke approvals eth revokecash see options weth
334424,need
334425,cant approve afaik eth hence weth used eth erc20 token
334426,interesting thanks
334427,pretty sure eth fork
334428,folks ethereum classic disagree
334430,users mean people calling oracles something read
334433,point
334437,guys program basic level pyteal sc algorand basic solidity idea implement single sided liquidity provision would like discuss eventualy deploy could find like minded people group student salary stuff like
334438,lot scattered discussion twitter amm related always tag one amm big brains like dan robinson
334439,interesting feel free pm talk
334440,idk cmc best source information id choose coingecko cmc day
334441,hi building dapp ethereum confused tool integrate debugging tenderly hardhat truffle suite others etc pointers differences among
334442,hi please check compilation 3 latest researches review mentioned tools 
334443,also fellow developers brief chat regarding
334444,anyone know defi protocol checklist something look apeing technical economic points
334445, good place start tokenomics https defisafetycom good place start development process quality
334447,thanks looks great
334448,maybe stupid question us tornado cash stable coins 
334449,tornado supports number stables already
334450,oh wow really found option
334452,hero

334470,talk cheap
334471,could anyone suggest good solution multi signature custody please copper good fire blocks something else
334472,gnosis
334473,ty ser appreciate support 
334474,im thinking
334475,gold standard afaik
334476,add one feature compatibility ledgertrezor possible
334479,project done airdrop tokens available provide liquidity eligible 10 tokens way get provide side pair ie eth
334480,o3swap
334482,ty look github
334483,sounds clever think idea
334484,dunno close ohm bond function
334485,gn lobs i've made collection use handbook find huge number proven solidity cheatsheets tools articles resources tools awesome bonus3 
334486,anyone look 
334487,
334488,anyone using fwb discord worth spending 4k usd
334489,ponzi
334490,disappointing looking forward good ponzi
334491,5 fwb enough local membership
334492,depends real nfts us based major city
334493,dont regret joining one bit totally worth heard alpha thru thats pretty lucrative get put
334495,
334496,collective hallucination seems quite attractive short
334497,
334498,
334499,
334500,
334501,ability attract huge tvl several days impressive
334502,bridging fee cheap though seeing abondoning anyswap anytime soon
334503,yeah im sure future plans compete fees big draw security ie recent wormhole exploit sol
334504,coinbase waitlist might easiest sign
334505,
334506,interesting stuff
334507,curve dao issue though seems like one bid higher voters accept whats given liquidity rented bribers dont feel like 11 paying makes much economic sense discount hence gud
334508,
334509,monday interesting stuff huh would actually fully agree might totally wrong though well see ui normies ultimate cashcow holds cexes arguably much biggerbetter product opensea crypto wallets afaik
334510,makes sense might also bribers dont know much theyre giving away see ill get x tokens checking bribe page idk though smells like somethings dont notice
334511,wonder sustainable option curve dao still maintain lead also using budget experiments like new fundraising gauge
334514,question crv emission eventually going zero hope lp fee alone incentivize liquidity like uniswap bribe anymore
334515,300 years
334516,think ain't curve maxi touted reducing emission bullish crv
334517,long tail becomes irrelevant sooner 100 years emissions go long
334518,like bitcoin sizeable rewards end soon enough even price x10
334519,see know curve emission long idea crv valuable even little emission enough incentivize liquidity
334520,make change wont able survive without bit inflation
334521,veeeery old convo seen replies yet u good articles maxi bit eric weis whatever name maybe coincenter people gud
334523,blz dont outright ask u get paid group lol redacted
334524,issue that's even issue value crv printed year much higher yearly admin fees curve generating otherwise bribing would make little sense possible gain xy giving away x bribes also bribing makes easy get crv rewards bit expensive thus making overspending less issue
334525,
334526,important article touching critical matters relevant future economy
334527,philippzentner sorry hear somehow observed bridges hacking incendents frequent defi mind wormhole thor synapse anyswap poly network etc got exploited
334528,huh gave idea something 
334529,looking poster uses events emit logs messages use centralized layer thegraph store index present
334530,
334531,sorry remotely make sense nourharidy
334532,unless shitposting bunch hot takes apples oranges compared idk unless missing something comparing huge stablecoin w capitalization like saying need less ops cost tesla company
334533,
334534,question didnt one get rekt pretty hard threw weeks back strike hit surely 10% immed loss blz help w stats juliankoh ser anons might fudded
334536,
334537,strat
334538,bit 3 wanna learn
334539,frankly playing options risk free
334540,youre betting volatility
334541,think cases better lp similar bet volatility
334542,thats likely sure since fees barely offset even slight move least yield quoted higher
334543,idk dhr robinsono
334545,essentially timediscrete arbitrage pic shows calendar arbitrage profiting theta curve diffs showing concept eg sell put 3000 eth strike buy another one 3000 becoming neutral neutral earning staking rewards side main thing getting neutered correct may wrong
334546,yusdceth put selling 2 epoches since lm round 2 started pocketed 2 rounds profit lm yes eth rekt lose money cash secured put somewhat bullish strategy betting eth get rekt much within week
334547,however eth slowly trending never drop much ie 15% within week still profit nicely
334548,invest equal amount eth cc csp way called short straddle shorting volatility works well crab market
334549,bet market crabbing pump rekt fare well
334550,never risk free use option express view either bullish bearish crabby
334551,
334552,
334553,apples oranges they're 1 stablecoins point i'm making exactly lot liquidity make huge stablecoin organic demand velocity exchange currently many times volumes dola fantom many huge liquidity stables going tiny 800k liquidity 100m liquidity wasteful help stablecoin one even trading using stablecoin
334554,easy brrr money increase capitalization using liq incentives mean anyone even using stablecoin
334555,good discussion tho thx curious hear others
334556,we'll long asset cc mean short straddlestrangle depending strikes ofc positive rbn offsetting bbookstyle side selling short say put users mms anyone open aucs
334557,agree need many types stable coins purpose farm yield stable store value like usdcusdt
334558,right dola pool 800k liq usable larger trader different use cases would argue
334559,yes cc supply eth cos long view crabby market cc csp win side
334560,definitely larger liq helps saying completely useless
334561,said many small trades larger volumes higher trade fees apy liq dola pool slowly growing liq way recently used worked curve skewed incentives using vecrv
334562,polygon weird
334563,yah got logic thx eg separating virtual portfolios mind trying find that's case strat mentioned twi post reluctant
334564,confused crab market strategy risk free downside protection
334565,definitely riskfree agreed trying express csp pool buying auctioned contract 1 p 1 p 0 rather 1 p 1 c 0 mind may mistaken would love fixed that's case
334566,mean csp call option thats bullish strategy
334567,meant 
334568,dont exactly understand vault stake cc csp auction bought understand 
334569,simply wrong matter legal arguments enriches teamfoundersvcs retail investor expense like said market bought retail victim

334718,thats totally different address
334719,makes sense understand that's big deal tokens synthetics certain chains like eth solanaterra groundbreaking compared bridging usdc chain chain b usdc destination chain synthetic issued bridge
334721,address transfer money hacker address reason
334722,well synthetic issued bridge unless issued circle chain supplied lps exchange synthetic asset counter party chain
334723,unless controlled
334724,maybe hacker owns ldos unless following sure

334907,mean anonymousplanetorg pretty good job enhancing paranoia end day practicality job run mullvad pihole
334908,thanks
334909,usdc invested maple probably want take allowing insane stuff happen
334910,please tell
334911,wrote short thing 2 weeks ago check next part likely posted today think onto something way worse 
334912,much lender comment makes assumption safe
334913,similar borrowers comp farming native token
334914,ethically maybe stupid simple farmer can't care much
334915,quite difference conceptually compound farmer whitelist controlled compound
334918,point mpl's price likely lower learn big part income comes someone borrowing usdc put back pool
334919,
334921,assume fbg mngr dumping farmed tokens price lower based happened described
334922,well think able explain try put info together today decide wanted give yall headsup
334923,apyvision
334924,could take snapshot project i'm gonna reimbursement exploited contract sure take without using subgraph
334925,type working style ideal defi guess crypto web3 etc general anyone find nomadic going project project especially start phase leaving day daydaily routine phase kicks push order define clear role stick around daily routine
334926,question really make sense defined role startup day 1 nomadism refers geographic location positions industry like project contribute discord apply job months yr see feel think still soon identify meaningful labor patterns yet
334927,think read bit much nomad thing describing wandering project project
334928,dont think theres right answer see cases frequent tbh maybe little nomadism described often short lived projects well may skew bit
334930,wondering anyone saw writeups daos vetoken models legal point view
334931,yeah hate country know called patriot
334932,lol outstanding scam
334933,yeah actually thinking decreased chances using word
334934,bet group sees laugh attempt
334935,always effective 
334936,buy xlm
334938,shit pointed super long time ago wasnt rules obviously loaners took advantage agreement never allow
334939,maybe join damn maple chat look writing medium article shit lol
334941,careful sometimes report account gets locked
334942,appreciate comment something apparently know little 
334946,screenshot attached 11th march answer mine article even see name idk man
334947,thats even relevant
334949,clearly agenda dude article best basically correction one conclusions oxc4t's article incorrect conclusion pointed maple discord twitter 29th jan whole month half prior article see screenshot discord
334951,sid also responded remarks matter requesting commentary publishing groundbreaking article seen
334953,story
334954,thats wrote today guess wait bit understand
334955,
334956,insinuating discord something else going writing discord asking borrow mpl either implying want short prior impact impending great journalistic work something contract bug either way questions way conduct around clearly indicate maliciousness transparent
334958,anyway
334959,ok got
334960,contacting core team problems know apparently malicious
334961,based screenshots youre everything trying contact team directly lmao oh god guise im acting good faith short token pretend earth shattering news
334962,like let anons come post shill links let anons come post fud links either people want put real name reputation behind something that's different
334963,anon making big accusation back facts otherwise probably better keep quiet related legitimate security issue good intentionsacting good faith deal private team
334969,issue discussed maple case extensively even fud facts thats bringing kinda moot doubleposting matter fin nothing new everybody knows
334970,
334971,interesting lido vesting contracts allow tweaking seems arthur hack case
334973,look tradfi equivalent loyalty shares
334980,via interaction archive rpc node indexer like covalentmoralis free plans try wary rate limiting though alternatively use scan api indexer first need compile list addresses reimbursement likely addresses ever interacted contract done via indexer look transaction history filter needed interaction lastly need metric reimbursement might token balance given blockheight values view function contract asomeusermetric archive node comes iterate list addresses ask node view function value needed block height forget log start scratch case bugtimeoutetc
334981,
334982,looks like decided join crypto instead previous threats 
334983, shots fired
334984,mattygoal sorry removing ur post accident 
334985,worries
334986,fyi cleared cache reinstalled works fine setup accounts tho
334987,hey fam researching lping strategies posted results article would love discuss community 
334988,
334990,leveraging uni v3 positions brilliant idea earning fees price flat protecting il price crashing mooning sounds fantastic progress understanding rebalancing happen
334991,thanks
334992,many ways eg 30min univ3 twap goes interval rebalance beauty approach youre staying ilprotected price range theres need pick precise point time rebalance
334993,
334994,new hack seems
334995,see thread info
334996,
334999,that's smart 
335000,really 
335001,least bridges latency essence would nice security sure amm defi protocols
335002,ye bridges seeing negative per se think bridges used defi protocols multichain bridges every protocol would need aave style multichain crosschain using terms correctly
335003,
335004,could add whitelisting top idk
335005,yeah believe next 18 months major projects introduce form withdrawal latency benefits outweight downsides
335006,could definitely introduce whitelist
335007,totally words tbh first breaks ethos second could partially defeat purpose
335008,yeah correct
335009,think better approach add priority execution feature flashbots priority execution available special bots tracks happens inside defi protocols smart contracts operations mempool safe em bot sees malicious operation could pause protocol relatively speaking top defi protocols implement bots passable feature rather reliably protect hacks
335010,think eden already onchain priority feature
335011,lol whats beef missed latest drama
335012,believe happen projects starting implementing architecture similar bentobox kashi multiple applications built top bentobox exit bentobox ecosystem general withdrawal latency could definitely interesting
335013,seeing youd think
335014,youd think possible
335015,well creating onchain cartel one argue sure works somehow hell tradfi take account main layer gov tokens security strip away
335016,solves composability issue applications collocate single vault eg bentobox moving applications dont deal withdrawal latency
335017,anyone build application top bentobox today think issue
335019,fully trusting basically unless slow true isnt yet another security concern less power em
335020,works theory hidden huge complexity defining detecting malicious operations easy first iteration attackers adjust attack rules set next iterations eventually would end situation similar heuristic analysis anti virus software meaning potential false positives lots things missed huge loss usability
335021,eden project openmev
335022,mistx flashbots rpc
335023,also consider frontrunners calculate opportunity compared gas costs simply sandwich profitable outbid gas costs thus make sandwiching unprofitable wont frontrun unless run sophisticated profitability algos context aware
335024,
335025,sam dissecting
335026,wonder hacker funds broken really small ammounts seen 
335027,goes strategies described initial tweet implement delay kind relative withdrawal size attacker split execution chunks different addresses would need apply rule total withdrawal throughput protocol suddenly limiting normal users dead end core issue things opinion fallacy make statements future attacks based past attacks without assuming attacker protection mechanisms example wormhole attacker could likely split 80k weth withdrawl 8000 1 weth without much effort
335028,delay formula could take account excessive number addresses withdrawing short time frame yeah sure create new kinds problems
335029,could average withdrawal volume protocol lock exceeds ntimes threshold thats basically circuit breakers tricky defi like things run autonomously sure would want protocols manually resumed even multisigdao
335030,basically hire 1000 admins respond every small case
335031,building like sounds like problem overhead anything
335032,yes maybe secure closed less agile web2 hello
335033,yeah gets messy soon go circuit breaker style road get impulse really skeptical could ever implemented way thats net positive terms security gain vs decentralization user experience
335034,reinventing fintech one step time
335035,anything already asynchronous like bridges mostly fine addon
335036,add kyc always catch bad guys
335037,protocol presume synchronous model fucked hard
335038,
335039,would yearn fucked exactly thought crosschain would reasonnable delays hurt badly plus necessarily mean txs supppose
335040,lobster fam going devconnect

335063,look boosting paragraph 
335064,interfaces automatically
335065,solidly
335066,math formula think changes depending programming language dev sorry
335067,meant solidly project fantom solidity language np dig probably forked part
335068,oh yeah know solidly work curve broke us enough
335073,shills get banned
335077,
335079,deleting explicit shills
335081,
335082,lol wtf funny
335083,based
335084, 
335085,sent
335086,hi anybody help first steps put etherscan new chain make smth like ftmscan team
335087,hi someone pls explain implementation process approved proposals daos work 10 years exp law understand process transformation decisions made described human language form llc approve money spending etc legal statements daos code set approved actions simple moreover interpretation final legal statements distort initial intentions question charge implementation decisions made dao talking decisions requires code upgrade companies audit new code confirm new code fits decision usual daomember without itknowledge sure new code fits decision decision requires certain actions standards dao example dao committees daos bodies confirm decision properly implemented
335088,dont want step anyones wallet argue good founding team pretty big precedent set burn balance one wallet increase another hm
335091,thats far model entails
335092,ignore reply speedy
335093,wallet held defiance moment genesis 
335094,defiances wallet 
335095,lol omg
335096,still understanding happened 0x48 defiance wallet
335097,real owner wallet got compromised 
335099,hey guys anybody explain secureum audit techniques 101 incident audit reviewing exploit incident root causing incident identifying underlying vulnerabilities proposing fixes mean type audit done exploit incident occurred public company wants check happened getting right 
335102,conceptually speaking depending governance structured entire protocol anon holder base domiciled anywhere snapshot multisig introduce thing 1 governor alpha compound aave big ones automatic execution basically vote code kinda majority wrong well tough luck see case compound new improvement rewards got exploited least gatekeeper external decision making party one passed quorum gg technically conceptually coleslaw meme code law coleslaw 2 snapshot vote multisig something tricky set conceptually want work like governor alpha vote offchain happens multisig executes humans signing things 2 things come legally speaking extent seen executives ok still degree risk make sure token holders trust must nonanon semianon people otherwise might well 1 person 8 anon twitter accs right factual possibility change multisig enacts something introduces degree subjectivity found bug implementation revote proceed correct code revote kinda acting good faith despite subjective besides sometimes daos go fully muh decentralized risking general partnership liability cases yet sometimes go via offshore swiss association setup nothing better nothing worse see things shape boomers figure punish good hardworking devs ps happens often misuse governance like oh coffee drink today voting actual contracts code thats blabla blz correct everyone wrong fk legal mambo jumbo redacting nonfactual comments
335103,upgradeable erc20 tokens protocol yay nay
335105,snapshot trying solve problem 2nd snapshot x yet released
335107,nathanvdh shill wants ye adapter also subjective move sense makes pieces critical process yet rests upon oracle meh like gnosis custom oracle
335108,may come handy 
335109,actual problem kinds votes disputable order prevent last minute attack know much details though
335110,simply speaking want trustless execution need everything happen chain need damn sure setup correct right safesnap snapshot use realityeth oracle gnosis game theory oracle doesnt automatically execute anything
335111,snapshot x good solution yeah live yet think live itll best solution
335112,solana question send funds token stake account recoverable
335113,dont think many people need completely trustless governance though think take compromises facilitate governance like multisig something personnaly im looking forward snapshot x kleros theres human interaction possible even result vote fuck sometimes id hate see truly trustless execution responsible big oof moments
335114,frontrunning currently possible optimism
335115,
335116,guess reach etherscan team explorers like blockscout open sourced one host one chain eg primary explorer used xdai chain otterscan developerslocal debugging may also work
335117,
335118,dont know real owner wallet
335119,might said compliance purposes fugezi idk matters even
335121,solana devs hacker sent usdc refunds users token accounts staking contracts instead users eoa usdc retrievable apparently relevant staking contracts quarry sunny upgradable case helps
335122,yes contracts upgradable 6jtj2tdynyyzwkwy5mjwqyqhkqztadvnfra1hw1bzmkr prob controlled quarrysunny multi sig
335123,last point speculation
335124,hi stat chain developers developing also stat number blockchain developers country apologies questions asked earlier finding difficult ctrlf many thanks 
335125,gives certain party leverage platter
335126,hey fren discuss tokens economics designed two models inflation deflation know one better
335127,fully ok nonshill share designs ask feedback
335129,
335130,expert wo biased hopr sebastian frens kinda cool right
335131,think hinted deja vu
335132,fees stopped using eth
335133,u use solana mev right hardcore sarcasm
335134,haha god
335143,
335144,pretty interesting
335145,two sets designs twitter project decentralized search technical structure similar graph inflation model wanted use stakingrate regulation network partners proposed deflationary model investors also asking scarcity tokens would reflected confused
335147,wonder % voting power needed something someone else assets sounds quite alarming highly centralized
335148,sure asking deflationary model burn token revenue happen u revenue token incentives data especially buyer persona thin inflation revenue absolutely always escape velocity blabla typical doint turn revenue model expanded hard milk users resource seems kk u shared though post op editing
335150,sound alarming lido guys r good faith done good faith wont side tbh dont think things even possible erc20 contract standpoint temptation
335151,good counterargument i'm pretty interested read 
335153,say decentralized search mean search google
335155,yes based decentralized storage make search engine
335156,way turn jit liquidity attack default method filling orders funds need sit lp pool traders could signal order jit could compete take reading dumb money lp seems waste programmatic traders could use flash loans fill swaps uniswap orders essentially limit orders would make sense bids compete fill
335157,model inflation based fact node's token gains come protocol gains that's regulation effect fact protocols node gains protocol gains pumpdumpdoes staking regulation fail early protocol revenue come users
335158,agree
335159,curious target market feels like much much bigger things worry inflation
335160,early days wanted make better mirror way find wanted see found data format stored arweave support search wanted help arweave build content index avoiding advertising find abbreviated model document twitter referring graph
335161,might misunderstanding since articles really clear website work first doc requires email google decentralized sorta like google things ethereum
335162,
335163,ser curious ur thouhts unless u prefer ghost understand beef
335164,ahhh info soon
335165,wider initiative getting people polygon
335166,muh initiative ser u know ngos muh organizations committees work
335167,gib core devs money u wanna make change otherwise larp sowwy
335168,specific context cases
335169,yes i'm charge designing token economy design protocol dappethereum settlement layer similar thegraph search arweave ipfs miners run service search storage token incentive miners needed know downloading data centralized search good way go best user experience comes centralization blockchain
335170,ah okay makes sense 
335171,looking decentralized file stores databases say want record users actions platform record data immutable manner blockchain using arweave ipfsfilecoin seem lot solutions persisting files websites database could send data able prove never altered always available
335172,number proposals arweave community people store layer1 data storage become layer0
335175,sounds like something l2 would able provide future possibly subgraph mix sure current solutions exist describing essentially blockchain
335176,ipfs cids give us never altered guarantee others try promise permanence like arweave ipfs based database solutions like orbitdb attempted that's probably closest describing thinks
335177,hi frens anybody know blockchain explorer wallet belongs cex say
335178,
335179,know etherscan
335180,amlbotcom investigation regime simple check costs slightly less investigation show clusters crystalblockchaincom buy product

335274,hey guys acquaintance mine traditional academia research daos asked help navigating crypto world question smart contracts automate salary payout regularly anything thats deployed blockchain actually use
335275,look sablier generally 
335276,idea regular payments kind gone simply proportional within every block rather traditional monthly pay day
335277,excuse proportional
335278,idea paid immediately consistent value added
335279,rather monthly pay cheque
335280,every block receive fractionalised part salary
335281,done normally hand right
335282,every 10 seconds someone hits pay button 
335283,
335284,thanks 
335285,question rather one automate determining adds much value thats besides scope atm
335286,replace payment process someone traditionally would fixed salary
335287,impossible automate process determining value creation
335288,i'd simply add comments git day make commits inflate numbers
335289,comes mind 
335290,convert spaces tabs entire project vice versa

335307,optimism lobsterdaily poll can't answer truthfully
335308,polls make 0 sense anyway lobstersaily communitycurated separate channel btw
335309,alexpgc21 ser tbh poll makes sense
335310,tend agree reduce discussionsshills like chain better collect alternative data number users across chains probably public pool isnt best idea deleted defi researcher protocols engineer need stat like think better organize typeform ux survey lobs chats
335311,halfassed data worse data imho dont need telegram people wrongly clicking multiple choice questions see people use
335312,best data actual chain data case rather biased non random sample
335313,nope tvl dex volumes active accounts number txs vanity metrics non eth chains alternative info track number usersusage kyced cex accounts web traffic properly managed surveys
335314,course use isolated metrics great indicators usageusability comparisons combinationsmore complex metrics without doubt give order magnitude better indicator poll survey
335315,context also key deciphering metrics would gathered deeper research exclude outliers
335316,context usage something could potential offer insights polls surveys done right
335317,dont think bad thing kinds polls long taken seriously
335318,useful data context alongside data make big picture
335319,yes agree data useful properlycarefully managed surveys within specific chatsgroupscontexts
335320,use sole source truth course stupid

335349,approve
335350,abuse approved
335351,get concern believe either see design flaw accept used like either way much merit overly blaming actors never doubt technically possible would naive assume wouldnt happen point maple basically two ways respond know possible working intended know possible working fixing saying want happen general case okay introduces sort casebycase stance issue confuses lenders borrowers point fud maple think interesting case many protocols uncollateralized loans get discuss side effects
335352,already said past cases allowed responded claims mgnrio
335353,yeah course ag smarted would done way would way harder detect
335354,werent caught maple still says ok

335365,hey peeps something odd happening recent blocks like blocks less utilisation
335366,gas prices still smokin high
335368,alternating filled empty blocks increases gas limit rebase calculation based fixed percentage block full base gas price increases 125% block empty decreases 125% 1 full 1 empty block follows total change 1012510125 0984 essentially gas limit increase 16% reality blocks completly empty completly full true gas limit increase mathematical quirk smaller still present
335369,guys tools tokenomics modeling simulation

335589,nah vesting flexible market dead unlocks respect people using protocol game whatever
335590,considering tbh thanks input 
335591,hyperinflation happens increase supply demand token shrivels would like know could work token design
335592,cant agree even tho safts always change always generally okay unlocks change besides ideally onchain changing peoples vestings work hand farm outside users arbitrarily surely okay alkdt1
335593,people play earn farm tokens dump would create demand high selling certain price would unfavourable

335610,weird thread tbh like let's ignore realities participation today
335611, token incentives enough alone effectively organize coordinate communities honestly think actually guaranteed way ensure anything crypto
335612,tokenholders users users might token holders design accordingly
335613,think supply sided demand sided correct phrases larger logic make profuct announce dao see contribute happy lurk wait buy use protocol earn token enable build strong network token dao eventually launched yeah point cant consider subdaos though even different functions arent subdaos cant function alone creates silos
335614,nvm index coop set protocol alchemist covalent etc quite bueno
335615,subdao definition smaller unit could self sustain work overall project created parent dao subset usersgeographyyada yada wrong

335749,yea downloaded ledger live app ask connect unlock device using mac usb incompatible bought 
335750,ordered company physical packaging arrived intact app connect ledger live allow app connect checks
335751,know app connected ledger live bro low batt right need charge
335752,packaging comes usb charging connect mac
335753,go initialisation proceedure yeah mac usb c need dongle alternate cable
335754,yea need alternate cable
335755,wait ledger needs connected via cable macbook thought bluetooth watched video explicitly state part connecting laptop
335756,gaslight bit used mm years got couple ledgers year also thought could bluetooth guess that's phone use
335757,nano x
335758,bluetooth nano x works mobile app give fck supporting everywhere else
335759,
335760,opened issue requesting support bluetooth ledger live three years ago absolutely response

335770,check support chains use
335771,mostly aside
335772,cant believe we're still using interface mm hardware 2017 mega fast growing tech space
335773,use frame
335774,yes started still need inject metamask cause project dont support frame yet
335775,quite upgrade agree
335776,use frame everything
335777,problem app click frame browser extensin click show metamask
335778,
335779,lmao lets continue nftavenue
335780, anyone take look pretty good read fat protocol theory eth
335781,frame battle tested mm tho
335782,thats great see people trying conceptualise feel applying much vc concepts ie private illiquid market crypto liquid speculative markets meta matters actual value chain capture world chia coming traditional vc investing saison capital entirely surprising
335783,things rational things like ltc etc etc would zero long time ie market dynamic meta matter proper value capture

335794,wdyt degens
335795,help coingecko become better
335796,thing easy collect major emission avg emission influation rate
335797,
335798,separating dao funds rest good idea also easy collect
335799,dao wallet 1 wallet usually
335800,understand intention correctly dao wallet funds community driven spending foundation wallet goals centralized leadership technically also separated
335801,foundation wallet always ends misused foundation cant print usually results delistings hard abandoning community consensus diff thing
335802,oh yeah seems fine realized dev went apply coingecko coingecko collect
335803,oh god pls yes tired seeing people talk fdv 70% supply simply allocated
335804,70% unallocated quite low lots coins 97595% locked
335805,locked unallocated dao spending really fdv inflation lm already allocated fdv
335806,ah misunderstood
335807,ivangbi maybe i'm missing something logic whole point fdv say market cap reach tokens enter circulation technically dao foundation market maker vesting team staking ever tokens exist easily enter circulation difference maybe dao spending board transparent investors
335808,least that's view fdv many tokens might enter circulation time
335809,daos spent like 1% spending far even tho like 1 year old really never ever 5 years even spend 50% really fdv sense make sense
335810,yeah get similar removing token emissions fdv emission rate 12% year tokens exist spent anyway much add stop 
335811,nobody inflates 12% year either larger close 0
335812,bitcoin inflates 175% moment 
335813,ok fuck win fine
335814,sorry 
335815,
335816,fdv principle tokens end open market point future speed conditions happens relevant opinion interested look current circulating supply tokens wallets subject special conditions
335817,coingecko wants improve could work actually tagging different wallets specific conditions maybe even generate token distribution charts based new metric category marketcap fdv really needed also metrics basically uselessmisleading without strict due dillegence right feed coingecko api returning arbitrary number accept circulating supply afaik correct wrong general projectwallet commit declared vestingreleaseinflation schedules via smart contracts highlighted well simply verifiable whether stick conditions way things currently work way trust based basic assumption minted tokens circulating supply projects able submit conditions specific addresses correct soon onchain movement invalidates conditions circulating supply increase
335820,cg collect data namely specific wallets foundation team wallets vesting terms sure actively monitored adjust circ vs fdv
335821,afaik show wallets substracted circulating supply without information except name thats optional also feed api whatever want accepted circulating supply right idea validation presentation could improved
335822,
335823,hey guys anyone work know someone dydx could get touch please

335831,anybody know there's stablecoin protocol partially backed like even overcollateralized token straight market value backed assets less market value stablecoin context i've started designing one protocol bunch ideas achieve wondering existing ideas
335832,wonderful idea
335833,esd successful implementation concept
335834,like frax fractionally backed usdc
335835,like segniorage coins like esd backed monetary policy
335836,well market value fxs usdc equal higher frax
335837,yeah trying understand question still
335838,said esd whale kek
335839,alleged
335840,hey folks would recommend offline crypto events london
335841,guess better way frame i'm wondering mechanisms besides full backing seigniorage also probably need get precise seigniorage exactly rough understanding peg buy burn seigniorage token peg mint sell seigniorage token seems right really work protocols use tricks stabilize peg
335842,look fei guess
335843,except work
335844,certainly doesnt work seen many failed algoundercollateralized stables works needs bootstrapped maintained carefully
335845,fair point seigniorage coins currently ustluna frax partially
335846,pretty much sure bunch others without meaningful volumeusage seem work problems usually first show pressure
335847,went back dig relevant 
335848,understanding fei model ie fully collateralized eth relevant reading 
335849,yes there's mechanism regarding protocol reacts undercollateralized raises question need 100% maybe achieve 50% cr maybe less iunno
335850,yes jcny hardpegged usdc polygon
335851,liquidate undercollateralized minters happens imagining worked bit like 0cost loan protocol deposit collateral get fei maintain minimum collateralization ratio get liquidated
335852,hard pegged usdc collateral right
335853,usdc
335855,exactly exchanged cl oracle
335856,frax ust segniorage coins one fractional reserve stablecoin overcollaterlized
335857,3 types stable coins right 
335858,cryptocollateral stable centralized stable algo stable
335859,fractional kind cryptocollateral algo one
335860,opinion way scale algo one
335861,hmm yes backed stable synthetic stable full collateral algorithmic mixed
335862,trilemma decentralized price stability capital efficiency
335863,what's seigniorage posted understanding mintsell buyburn
335864,also push back bit think there's many ways could potentially algorithmic stablecoins
335865,price stability 
335866,well unless fei mechanics changed collateralization entire stablecoin reserve per minter dynamics protocol less eager buy shitty prices price goes 1 protocol buy really bad rate hand mint great rate way around price 1 afaik
335867,amazing guess aggregators use well
335868,message replying seems deleted missing context city 
335869,though many almost exclusively better ampl copypastas tweaks time horizon 2 weeks
335870,depends collaterlized collaterlized partially collaterlized guess thats categories define segniorage normal crypto world sees kind none collaterlized fully algorithmically backed example ampleforth ohm also segniorage stablecoins backing
335871,talking algo stables read 
335872,really dubious thread get tokens peg remain persistently peg
335873,that's intents purposes reason nubits fell apart least calls conjecture

335932,john definitions thread trustlessness believe also presentations elaborate good starting point think paper 
335933,faucet drops native tokens chains new addresses example generate new account ledger polygon want drop matic without kyc ideally service would support chains well could seed account funds transactions network would interested building something like anyone finds useful similar products available example way could onboard users directly l2
335934,problem dexible sell strategy
335936,mean something like need refill wallets difficult task kind faucet avoid people creating multiple addresses claiming since mainnet tokens cents per request enough incentive people countries think pass checks make

336038,please ser money's gonna made end token price matters underlying tech
336039,normal project perform vesting allocation manual good faith lock behind smart contract mechanism i'm looking sand right seems discrepancy vested current balance address example advisor supposed 225m unvested yet contract address left 144m
336040,general vesting contracts auditable third party service unicrypt lock tokens fixed periods used lot teams play cautiously leave things unlocked need adapt changing needs ie original assumptions change market dynamics change
336041,see guess provides flexibility company would ensure investors regards vesting schedule becomes difficult keep track actual circulating supply
336042,illusion teams often change things
336043,extra supply new exciting listing introduce farmingstaking wasnt ever part roadmap stay current say theyre defi delays theyre behind roadmap dont want seed investors dump etc etc etc
336044,ethos matters rest gamed blockminded says
336045,ser really wanna b malicious leave ala hanging relaunch new forked product bugfree new anon handles time
336046,putting much faith coingecko circulating supply data
336049,yes thats time accurate even accurate time need manually look tokens vested circulating supply market cap fdv useless metrics put context investigated
336050,perpetual futures introduce problem vested tokens vested parties capital simply short vested amounts perps hedge actual unlock happens
336051,coingecko accurate point data first published disclosures teams provide disclosure made circulating supply figures inaccurate andor estimated seldom updated stages project lifecycle met supply diluted circulating supply subjective different products cmc gecko ways establishing supply numbers based honesty underlying team
336052,yes agreed think going get exciting get fully functioning solidly type amm key question weather noobs bsc understand work
336055,hello good lobsters anyone know python equivalent bignumberjs 
336056,decimal
336057,key question wether devs build understand works would first 
336058,check mpmath library
336059,i'm using decimal perhaps getcontextprec 17 enough precision
336060,thanks
336061,set precision default 28 remember correctly

336084,transparency important
336085,wallet controls stolen funds 
336087,axies nfts safe 
336088,i'd think stupid
336089, please tell fund account binance 
336090,way sell axie via ronin
336091,lmao
336092, lol yeah binance assume could bought donor account
336093,actually seems like gained control 4 validators tricked fifth one signing using deprecated api article fairly good job describing 5th validator limit info first four managed get control sky maviss four ronin validators attacker used hacked private keys order forge fake withdrawals bit sus
336094,sky mavis address allowlist
336095,uh exploit go unnoticed 6 days
336096,yeah super weird like monitoring funds
336097,would hack bridge nobody notices still dont transfer funds
336098,weird
336099,hello jump trading bridge
336100,
336101,protocol operations engineer
336102,mean u buy kyc 50 darknet
336103,thats also true use someones pc full access browser thus binance ie donor persona example 
336104,cashing cex way
336105,sure ftx wont let trade cash
336106,tornado cash
336107, also require kyc uses wallets binance
336108,didnt notice one eoa withdrew eth bridge 1 transaction
336109,yeap whole behavior pretty weird hack
336110,interesting see unfolds
336111,multi sig required centralized validators could go wrong
336112,
336113, front end built core team larp
336114,balancers new ui terrible
336115,oops saylor bought btc right 
336116,defi season didnt hire new front end team season

336123,wormhole ever got back hacked eth btw
336124,amazed one noticed 6 days sum
336125,
336126,one guy got liquidated short 
336127,guys recently someone shared good resource best options stake stable coins good yields trying find message someone help keyword get message
336128,hack found siiiiix days later
336129,looks lot like convex

336141,sam talk defriday last week said fpis coming next 12 weeks
336142,check see wallet receiving
336144,contrary last period really started poly hack
336145,maybe sign
336146,withdrawals halted ronin
336147,1 validator went offline since 0 withdrawals processed
336149,btw quorum upgrade 5 8 executed 12 hours ago axie deployer eoa 
336150,explain 
336151,antagonistic voting good reason designed
336152,
336153,8of9 requirement terrible liveness
336154,yeah that's question halted purpose validator went offline
336155,
336156,hacks getting moreworse
336157,bigger pool fish guess
336158,levels complexity newer protocols well easier reason uniswap compound wont hacked versus bridge gateways across 10 chains massive multisig risk
336159,usdc polygon native wrapped
336160,solidly change vote bribing capabilities wrt curve problem holds tokens 
336162,
336164,
336167,hello sers wrote thread blockchain scalability 
336168,even tops wormhole hack forgot mention money stole validators addition bridge additional 8500eth 
336169,anyone issues metamask ledger metamask cant seem connect
336172,yep always
336173,try framesh
336174,thanks frame works
336175,complexity surface area
336176,wrote gonna keep getting worse honest majority assumption bridges huge security hole 
336177,possible fca could extend deadline crypto companies already started moving operations nearby european destinations like croatia switzerland emilyjnicolle ivanlevingston detail companies moves 
336179,
336180,anyone asking many multisigs secures terra's btc reserves
336181,probably dont worry game theory optimal steal
336184,everyone hopefully uses llama airforce union struggle free bribe gathering experience
336185,good writeups cold walletseed backup strategies location sharding medium etc
336186,
336187,
336188,imagine trying take moral high ground holding alleged critical bug ransom think getting paid enough
336189,didnt realize morally acceptable ill keep mind next time feel like im getting paid enough
336190,morality moving target suppose
336191,maybe kyc
336192,doesnt sound like im happy proven wrong
336193,current bug anything like last bug though idk
336194, sounds like make nft emits fake transfer events spoof sender make look like famous people using nft
336195,around ages mint function scam projects mint influencer wallets shows open sea influencer minted project opensea checks transfer event comes zero address displays famous wallet minted projecta
336196,know ton newbies fallen fomo
336197,remember uniswap purchase spoofs story
336199,
336200,far understand solidly youre basically bribed promise vote x change vote bag last minute votium snapshot based kind broken yes protocols dont use
336201,still interested seeing people freestyle top solidly model like enso avax
336202,twitter thread
336203,
336204,googlely
336205,enso changing anything interesting live
336207,another thing note trading fees pairs automatically converted solidly bribes pair's gauge initial assumption fees pair producing voters incentivized vote really hold
336211,bribe issue one solution lock votes x days
336212,work assuming 35 x 7 think lower x makes sense can't make lower half epoch though
336213,hi
336214,currently process querying wellwritten documentation postmortem bridge saas hacks like axs ronin roninhack event think sc auditing u provide links resources u homie thanks
336215,7 days voters still switch vote snapshot
336216,trading fees pseudobribe incentive vote gauge see hold
336217,supposed fix vfat0 snapshot page mentioned
336218,hey guys trying throw shade blame axie anyone know exactly took ronin 6 days notice 100000 eth moved funds spread across many addressesplaces hard visually track understand possible notice 1 address anyone backstory took week
336219,maybe thought cod retrieve funds became public problem
336220,iirc adjusted 89 etc 10 hours medium
336221,bet complacency working well long enough trusted perfectly fine place monitoring tools
336222,think trying solvage situation
336223,would reaction hack notified ronin closed source gather
336224,think also makes statement userbase level adoption usually users would notice something like immediately
336225,seems weird 100000 eth monitoring even periodically stare make sure still exists wondering really obvious 1 address complex monitor
336226,ya seems odd
336227,1 tx moving
336228,keep milking week
336229,attempted cover job dont announce know whats going sure actually rekt sort thing
336230,tx see series tx address etherscan can't figure ultimate source eth 1 address
336231,guess we'll know truth time goes
336232,
336233,wow that's casuali really hard time believing one noticed something like week
336234,rektnews
336235,good one
336240,withdrawerc20foruint256 withdrawalid address user address token uint256 amount bytes signatures
336241,anyone idea saas implementation ronin communicating multisigs works actually know nothing one
336242,twit someone notticed thought team rugging got blocked discord
336243,
336244,nah message anon rly fucking weird idk anyone uses justification warned ever received would probably thought lunatic spammer asking money persopn could clearly said hey bridge tx look
336245,operate defi protocol receive messages like time
336246,hand another interesting question whether projects using bridges monitoring systems place let's say multichain exploited long teams utilize bridge assets ledgers find
336247,merch alexs tshirt
336248,assumptions prob chains 'running like normal'
336249,least glance wallet's ballance would add extra second banning lunatic moving life

336252,feel free dm active area
336253,interested well think there's plent bounties axs websites pay mainly remember paying front end stuff guess common
336254,idk last question refers tho
336255,bug bounties extremely common i'm talking third party services support bounty finders
336256,sort like company putting equity bounty finders betterment dlt space i'm sure
336257,one
336258,wanted get lobster help sop speaking covered bit less obvious programs really lm still give potentially good incentive wdyt howd u structure anything similar

336263,q would anyone know litecoin based solutions referring kwon mentions interview evaluating trust minimize bridges btc ust swap case litecoin based solutions wrapped btc unchained laura shin
336265,thank useful ser
336266,
336267,hold bribes distributed throughout week voters especially big ones like 0xdao sure solidlysex optimising voting process allocating votes highest yielding pairs change closer epoch's end fact amount fees generated pair amount votes gauge receives snapshot correlated
336268,yeah making 45 days also awkward could vote per epoch instead fairly easy fix implement forks though make inhouse bribing work intended
336269,yes voting per epoch 7 days period would fix streaming bribe
336270,gonna set proposal funding eth devs soon
336271,via curve dao convex dao voted specialised vefunder gauge
336272,
336273,one goals promote gauges go beyond liquidity mining recently successfully funded vyperlang development makes us first dao fund public good token inflation
336279,anyone know wtf address randomly sent eth yesterday
336280,
336281,send back dao come

336473,anyone eu please vote shit 
336474,quick
336475,idea nfts
336476,principal difference curve theyre transferrable kind undermines resistance governance attacks reasoning behind entirely clear
336477,elaborate 2 reasons ac gave point 1 b 
336478,dont know exact reasoning suppose could vecrv cannot moved possibly long periods time means users lock entire ecosystem highly incentivizes less liquid crv becomes result multiple reasons low crv liquidity would bad
336479,anyone defi safety 
336480,river0x
336481,tokens disappear end lock period curve solidly
336482,burn vecrv get locked crv back lock ends sure solidly
336483,transferable preferred overall opinion gov attack seems part value accumulating problem solidly think would
336484,see volume trading venft done need use nft marketplace
336485,prefer nontransferrable accumulating attack protocol harmful nonorganic demand wouldnt include value calculation
336486,
336487,accumulate buying non locked tokens locking anyhow restricting locked transfer really help much gov attack maybe ac made transferable sell venft bags one day
336488,nontransferability lead centralization curve controlled convex people actually get liquid vecrv fact governance attack isnt easier happen already
336489,also feel way steth lido compare vecrv staked eth validators people usually start understand elegance vetoken system entire point nontransferrable another entity actual protocol must hypothecate derivative like steth eth lido
336490,
336491,convex return also nft please compare soliditys nft vs convexs returned tokens
336492,partially personally think eth less governance impact eth chain still leads centralization steth actually stands eth rewards aka added bonus system tends work better cvxcrv nothing farm token steth somewhat value backing nonetheless staked eth controlled lido controlled governance token almost votes privateseed team ye centralized nonetheless exactly model imo
336493,happening element deployer minting setting vesting packages elfi tokens 
336494,main conceptual parts two point vetoken transferrable would defeat entire point system way staked eth wrapped transferrable protocol level would remove security guaranteesslashing block producers
336495,token btw 
336497,elves smurfs
336498,thats true thinking gns gmx glp liquidity pool token holders counterparty trades studies showing long term cumulative pnl traders trends negative well gns gmx platform data running year show trader pnl negative
336499,possibly security nonetheless centralization bank also safe money pockets imo way want go nontransferability good get convex layer top venft imo elegant solution lidocvx want something benefit could basically anytime theres 0 protection already governance attack nfts still every user able part obviously 51% attack happen enough money could said liquid coin risk doesnt really increase fully unlocked governance token
336500,sure nfts optimal solution defi attempt attempt relying 1 entity trustful
336501,nft convex also return nft cant normal token
336502,locked token isnt sellable normal market nft gives somewhat liquidity transfer still access open market
336503,allow easier open market liquidity eg anti centralization reason mentioned whats downside open market
336504,luna staked galactic punks immediately go redelegate unstake gp lost access validator user funds also slowly get slashed preferred validator feel free stake us dankuzone w daic
336505,think missing point i'm making entirely agree single entity monopoly derivative issuance layer bad pointing protocol one allows staked tokens wrapped transferrable whether nfts erc20 tokens entirely selfdefeating pointless ethereum issued wrapped erc20 token representing staked eth validators would defeat entire point staking eth validator first place
336506,spotify cryprocurrency podcast recommendation thanks
336507,cool could get link studies talking cheers
336508,doesnt 3rd party adding transferable token result meaninglessness logic
336511,anyone idea happened solana supporting move vm stop supporting
336512,example lido still care behavior otherwise eth backing steth gets slashed thing convex vecrv vefxs holds depreciate value destroy protocols hold staked tokens contrast alternative proposed protocol give transferrable token representing staked asset end user vote produce blocks token dump instantaneously block see selfdefeating feature
336513,whole point standpoint governance attack protection attacker commit position correlated protocol success lose money order attack transferrable lock bunch solid perform attack sell nft liquidity allows convex lot vecrv attacking curve would destroy convex well since entire incentive structure dependent crv
336514,could slash 51% votes
336515,definition canonical majority useless question since irrelevant owned 51% wrapped nfts wrapped staked erc20 tokens would thing
336516,hmm looking one day traders necessarily leverage 
336517,thats model leads original one illiquid though fact whatever want
336518,venfts pretty much sellable aside otc whatever real important part comes utilization borrowing etc
336519,need create governance token make lockable without transfer 1 entity owns voterights anything anyways due fact point thats mean indirectly ruin idea venfts better maybe maybe try fix issue finding balance
336520,
336521,leads us normal people care governance therefore normal people governance work
336522,really already explained agree monopoly one entity controlling staked asset avoided obviously entire point make sure vibrant economy entities form hypothecate derivative staked nontransferrable token like hope case staked eth single man show lido
336523,agree theres multiple entities fighting good ecosystem also risk ruin governance aka crv convex
336524,way fight monopoly wrap staked asset protocol layer thus completely ruin economic system way solve foster vibrant decentralized distribution staked asset basically arguing eth issue wrapped version staked eth lido cannot capture 51% staked eth terrible idea issuing liquid staked eth completely destroys security guarantees pos
336525,one entity holding tokens necessarily bad depends control structure entity nobody generally objects daos holding 50% token treasury spend see fit long faux governance ala time cvx ownership fairly welldistributed
336526,whole votebadanddumpfast attack really problem reality market react bad votes weigh versus centralized entity like convex controlling curve
336527,wrapped staked eth venft really one liquid really ye whole models completly matured yet imo see ends
336528,bad performance maybe eco much defi proper governance structure
336529,recently justin sun borrowed load comp add tusd collateral
336531,ya see evolves think vetoken system misunderstood lot people similar staked eth steth dapp layer anything else view like helps frame economics bit
336532,think reasons
336534,convex voting behalf holders technically contract allows reach use vetoken vote oss ui contracts itd seem curve put decentralize game
336535,cvx holders control vecrv soon vefxs convex holds votes
336536,works similar curve gauges ie 50% locked cvx votes pool 50% convexcontrolled vecrv also votes pool
336537,mirrors bribers get way
336538,thanks gmx specific stats handy would love know cumulative pnl date
336539,think system built top afaik votium checkpoints addresses voted particular pool allows claim bribe
336540,howdo votium convex work together compete
336541,votium doesnt control votes way convex said holders let convex vote dont come voted already take
336542,come compound forks exploited often original code safe far except one bug proposal code
336543,devs always change something dont understand
336544,people blatantly fork protocols minor changes arent good devs begin
336545,magic strong
336546,compound price oracle exploit 90mln liquidations dai coinbase attack pretty bad oracles could lead loss user funds billions usd like year
336547,also v bug cost another 90 wonder forks code
336548,gmx gns personal favorite tbh 
336549,cvx holders control curve convex team thats decentralized cant cvx holders vote ways harmful curve convex sell cvx way thats criticized transferable solidly tokens
336550,would convex voters decide harm curve would damage convex well
336551,yes indeed that's also cvx also requires nontransferable locking 16 weeks order vote see figuring 
336553,bug proposal code original codebase exist forks 
336554,solidly adds 16 weeks venft
336555,we're good notice proves entire point nontransferability protocol layer entire premise entire time curve ethereum correctly identified crucial part design
336556,even nft erc20 whats nft benefit
336557,believe nft different lock times made tradeable token nonfungilbe
336559,convex handle
336560,convex perma locks crv fxs tokens 4 years always issues derivative token max lock 1 1 that's they're fungible
336561,case protocol wars holders vote ways benefit protocol harms curve convex sell
336562,edit answered
336563, please read convex docs questions becoming bit trivial
336564,hi guys theme olafinance hack wanted know anyone knows way revoke approvals seems revokecash doesnt support fuse
336565,hello
336567,say often coiner says every many compound forks talking actual numbers vulnerabilities thanks 
336568,ok right convex docs say lock crv forever user gets back cvxcrv liquid need lock cvx 16 weeks vote guess convex socializes 4 year period smaller 16 week chunks trying get convex improves things see function boot inactive locked cvx thats voting 4 weeks trying figure else convex actually fixes completes whats missing curve therefore solidly rekt food farmer good videos stuff 
336569,moderately relevant venus cream rari hundred one
336570,granted might relevant week
336571,would anyone lock directly curve instead convex shouldnt new solidly use 16 weeks lock non transfer instead 4 years replace need convex type sister project maybe doesnt hurt curve convex exists new solidly would wait come solidly already built votium afaik
336572,one polygon 
336573,use debankcom support fuse check approval tab
336574,thanks would interesting see many compound forks know two recently launched aurora network there's one that's public tokensale moonbeammoonriver moment
336575,wasnt keen downloading wallet
336576,thanks
336577,there's probably hundred considering easy hit button github especially there's howto guide 800 according ever make

336582,hey guys projects aware achieved substantial tvl 500m without incentives
336583,rari capitals fuse
336584,convex locking mechanics borrowed eps think would probably make ve33 challenging implement
336585,that's something probably see future tokemak
336586,projects dont need super inflationary sometimes inflationary emissions since liquidity provided via toke holdersdirectors
336587,even relevant
336588,see projects worry liquidity mining rewards asking projects achieved 500m without incentives commented think see tokemak's liquidity direction mechanics
336589,dont know currently though
336590,doesnt make sense liquidity needed paid needs emissions
336591,tokemak doesnt fix though sowwy felt like muh shill
336592,anyone know anything alleged fantom vm code available come diff language compile solidity
336593,il incurred onto toke stakers liqudity directors lp done via 2 single staking sides reactor
336594,different people staking abc token pair token eg usdc eth
336595,1 way renting liquidity maybe cheaper still costs emissions would encourage reading thinking liquidity 
336596, ye still rented liquidity still brrr
336597,thanks insight sers yes that's i'm trying study basically new ways attracting liqudity without aggressive inflation read

336722,pleb loser
336723,ngmi
336724,apparently u self delegated 0 tokens u claim one elf whitelist spots
336725,maybe misinfo maybe retroactively excludepunish people
336726,ye risk guess want elf thing
336727,agree think people
336728,definitely bcoz basically nobody claimed according etherscan
336729,still 11 holders
336730,guess worth punting gas
336731,first minting drop live delegate voting power others eligible minting elf nft
336732,even message delegation

336738,trying share potential alpha venerable community
336739,guess claim delegators balance fair one
336740,bitcoin fees i'm wondering btc really sustainable terms fees miner rewards seems like today fit around 2000 txns block miner rewards 6547000 usd meaning protocol stops paying miners work txns pay around 65470002000 15275 usd per txn that's way much even initial setup thots go wrong

336764,10 elfi would love
336765,thatd unicorn fdv unreasonable
336766,first days depending market liquidity later well see fair letting airdrop bag speak kek
336767,trying trade
336768,hol sec fellers elfi actually surely protocol operated fine without decentralising token deserve 1b fdv gonna slow judgement mean yields fixed yay wahoo damn they're almost boring bank's
336769,88mph years ago proved legit noone cares fixed rate dev team rotated another project
336770,depends usage defi security predictability fixed rates one things may drive adoption decentralized finance
336771,always good options right
336772,holy ivan lot voting power
336773,even kek
336774,people delegated 0 tokens banned whitelist need redelegate claimed
336775,anyone know actually trade elfi token interesting airdrop
336776,need someone make proposal
336777,indeed risk tolerance completely disconnected rest world lol hope boosts tvl protocol fees want work see successful example yet 3
336778,well works fixed rates quite standard thing defi dozens protocols mean

336979,ser meant authors pushed journal 
336980,quoted arxiv cause earliest version found know arxiv works thank
336981,anyone confirmed phd degree field coauthors without phd there's sure certain percentage higlyengaged works get much attention
336982,ah pardon usually theres link arxiv page paper published thats confused ty ser
336983,googled accusing bad scorched crypto communities throwing peer reviewed papers walking home arxiv link suggestion never enter radix community platform

336988,chat entitled community members wed like devs chat stay chat
336989,well observations aiblockchain used establishing optimal mining strategy improvement 5g6g technology security several studies saw one interesting realworld application eyes ai blockchain used distribute load due ddos attack onion site system detected situation automatically copied containers new ips thus ensuring 100% availability site users actions coordinated smart contract managed load private blockchain ai used build clever system analyzed logs endgame implementation
336990,blockchain two basic things help everyone ability reliably store validate information cannot faked use alternative layer backend frontend data layer benefits security logic take two mix ai
336991,ty ser something like keepers triggered smart contract coordination since smart contract cant action without called
336992,done automatic mode manual mode buy lot ip load system
336993,unfortunately young remember everything detail load balancing system definitely worked blockchain
336994,modern blockchain could feasibly support enough compute data practical ml model time ai blockchain buzzwords used best centrallyrun model applied blockchain data kind smoke mirrors since model doesnt care analyzes blockchain data particular train graph cnn classify blockchain txn sic model kind graph data really theres nothing intrinsically web3 projects ones ive seen anyway
336995,anyone know excel google sheet add able pull information eth contract ex many x tokens wallet holding

337007,alas takes social engineering genius make hacker make mistake least hypothetical situation

337013,dont think interesting arb without deploying contracts trading bot either written tsjs golang python help submit transactions youll need program contract executes complicated strategies onchain
337014,
337015,interesting distributions
337016,thats nicely written pretty cool
337017,way interesting ones uninteresting ones saturated wont last long 
337018,yeah
337019,
337020,redacted bought terra
337021,unofficially bought 
337022,reading wrong
337023,basically ye
337024,forks dying dont think bad move smart making interesting degen econ things issa interesting read
337025,ye sounds like win win tbh
337026,
337027,5% market bribe actually quite high bribes cost gets diluted oblivion
337032,anyone else besides polygon using plonky2 zk rollup
337033,actions coordinated smart contract managed load can't imagine would look like would need smart contract load balancing logic also debatable whether smart contracts private blockchains actually smart contracts regular distributed apps
337035,whole soon aiml deanonymize tornado users thing also highly questionable kind magic work around cryptography likely reduce manual effort needed unmasking people made mistakes first place
337036,researched question one found great stuff using smart contracts ddos attack mitigation 
337037,mentioned know described system works exactly well something compare based studies
337038,anyway original question practical application blockchain mlai concepts went far definitely trying fud tornado awesome tutela received grant well
337039,approach proposes architecture implementation approach signaling white blacklisted ip addresses across multiple domains based blockchains smart contracts advantage using smart contracts blockchain make use already existing infrastructure distribute rules without need build specialized registries distribution mechanismsprotocols b apply rules across multiple domains means even autonomous system victim applying rules traffic still filtered c victim control customers get blocked central element remaining show proof ip ownership seems relevant part idea basically use public blockchain distribute filter rules attacker ips
337040,cryptography seeing 1 02 02 02 02 02 1 allows narrow significantly
337041,humans like centralize that's vector mldriven analysis
337042,get idea thats exactly works already
337043,yes nsa software identify based way write i'm gonna suprised they've already cracked torn
337044,people math always weak link systems like
337045,yeah 100 people 01 eth 100 people take 01 eth able find exactly responsible deposit
337046,like writing styles tons unique markers
337047,yes one person steals exactly 3852 eth fragments another wallet slowly receives 3852 eth course several weeks start make educated guesses need parallel construction
337048,see likely reduce manual effort needed unmasking people made mistakes first place
337049,assuming split walelts withdrawn fixed increments like 1 eth
337050,putting 3852 eth withdrawing exact amount single wallet kind mistake talking even problem plausible deniability
337051,think vastly underestimating computing power thrown problems like remember deal computers today crypto records gonna around 5 10 20 years computing improved even
337052,people thinks ml analytics solve lt wont think regulators demand full kyc resource funds every single wallet used mixers couple years
337053,throw much computing power aiml want possible logical solution problem wont get solution
337054,yes sufficient datasets assume sake argument i'll know exchange accounts slowly withdrew around 3852 eth seemingly showed torn wallets
337055,basically saying unmask people dataset allows unmasking point many cases wont due nature tornado works ai magically going change dont input variables output want lets say 10 people interact tornado cash exactly way never able tell apart beyond reasonable doubt
337056,tornado magically going keep private
337057,technology use properly used properly theres also limits ai
337058,seem missing point amount x went torn anon wallet amount x flowed bank account wallets known control came torn watching io flows reasonably narrow list people received x scrutinize thoroughly start adding io personal level something add easily apply scrutiny found right person
337059,could certainly see someone making risk score per wallet based already known patterns interacted tornado hold compromised eth sure something specific wallet hack relevant level one needs keep monitoring wallets abnormal activity dig deeper needed manually
337060,cba discuss certainly whos missing point gn
337061,know value created know value destroyed know flows list unknowns need solve data lasts forever whenever get new tech throw problem sound like winning game
337062,simple though one using properly doesnt matter anyway far nuanced convo pretty useless 
337064,thats like saying able determine whether 2 2 actual square root 4 need technology computing power 
337065,discussion reminds good quote theory theory practice practice
337066,i'm claiming narrow 100% confidence narrow set small really make difference human
337067,kind like image recognition got point computer could reliably tell difference dogs cats got good multiple layers took 3 decades phone background
337068,maybe could track every 20 dollar bill used today doxx based information
337069,tornado free
337073,protocol free gas optional use relayers
337074,part proper functionality either way saying unmask people basically put neon sign backs announcing wasted time using tornado cash means aibrockshane contraption unmask everyone reads manual impressive case jumping conclusions bias due exploit notwithstanding
337075,handwaving away unsolvable problem saying ai solve really make sense
337076,may silly i'll give bandits may redeploy set adjacently related addresses leave enough breadcrumbs pattern recognition tool ai connect dots back astute bandit would put work ensure modularized sequester stream exit points destinations example desire found high enough fragment aggregation time location disappear useburnbury 310% cheaper paying taxes think larger challenge reliably wash get want meat space
337080,cant believe got rugged nft airdrop literally put calendar mint today 
337081,alejoamiras vpepo mean rely uniswap optimism oracle given optimism every transaction confirmed individual block the blocktimestamp of blocks however reflect the blocktimestamp of last l1 block ingested sequencer reason uniswap pools optimism suitable providing oracle prices highlatency blocktimestamp update process makes oracle much less costly manipulate 
337082,adding computer power ml calculation need solve identification problem cookies user fingerprint data add range input features user yes one input amount well nns magic boxes
337083,next version torn nova could see reason withdraw tornado send receive swaps use defi funds live darkness

337170,hey coiner mean dev actually great question optimism evm updated return blocktimestamp timestamp actually work expected sadly can't find optimism's release notes
337171,guess going busy day defi come likely
337172,really keep3r oracle used widely
337173,also even audited afaik
337174,block price computing
337175,falling victim criticism duh
337176,referring keep3r inverse 
337177,inverse supposed ensure using safe periphery well really whole keep3r story tho looks like used way without additional measures
337178,we're nice cartel everyone support profits least like consensuslevel version pretending community vote cartel norm wen new larimer experiment
337179,new article vitalik masterpiece quite surprising see endorsing btc vs coins including eth actually
337180,monopoly possible crypto open source
337181,anyone unhappy exit build
337182,naive crypto invent open source
337183,naive builder whatever want severely underestimated powerful
337184,definitely harder think opensource prevents monopoly completely
337185,lol
337186,
337187,wow
337188,idealistic storytelling never cease amusing must've nice projects change licenses restrictive reality hit
337189,without idealism build anything new
337190,new things invented discovered
337191,maybe that's good enough justification stick ones head sand
337192,that's true science sociology
337193,ahem wen tornado flash loans

337203,ivigamberdiev got oracle inverse keep3r's 
337204,answered post earlier read dont think even percieved shill ivangbi asking stay fair redact legit stuff
337205,inverse oracles storage
337206,mainly asking oracle maintained year announcements done regarding
337207,never modified
337208,looks like
337209,welp 
337210,frax amo minter kind ui something like dai psm
337211, using keep3r network oracle deprecated using code manually executed deployer's address update price
337212,optimism dev 
337213,still advise using uniswap prices oracle i'm mistaken uniswap price reflects price last block least that's worked v2 optimism every transaction currently block mempool private lead situation attacker manipulates price buying lot tx performs action using manipulated price next tx reverse price manipulation selling bought token third tx submit rapid fire nobody able react fast enough enable arb manipulation since mempool private transaction processed fifo fixed upcoming bedrock release actual blocks minted regular intervals though obviously eliminate risks using uniswap oracle always required reading 
337214,interestingly attack still feasible sequencer real concern decentralize sequencer we've discussing saurik 2m bounty claimant
337215,interesting
337216,arbitrum vulnerable issue
337217,i'm super familiar w design looking arbiscan also looks libe 1 txblock would say yes
337218,
337219,
337220,interestingly looks like inversefinance hack looks exactly like attack described shows even mainnet immune kind attack looks like key possible really exploit inv price discrepancy liquidity pools nobody could inv store would recognize loaning inflated price good deal would really tricky bot figure even used twap oracle even naive spot price deets link shared 
337221,long
337222,i'm still trying figure maintained oracle high prices oracle maintained manually
337223,jesus
337224,insane
337225,looks like price actually arbed back late
337226,seems like oracle warded
337228,need maintain large period
337229,imbalance produced updated oracle rate
337230,
337231,
337232,
337233,
337234,got war room willing contribute lmk
337235,dola peg suffering small 4m bad debt raising rates significantly across lending protocols using feds peg fully restored within hours
337236,take lot bring dola given peg enforcement tools disposal
337237,hey nour sorry sad happened happy help
337238,appreciate kindness please dont feel sad sorry ive ready day 1 signed im ready take 10x
337239,founder's perspective get point that's right spirit 
337240,inverse already grown sustainable business model able pay debt growing revenue
337241,
337242,ammderived oracles especially l2s apparently somewhere deadend playing dynamite discuss
337243,really need define well want handle
337244,like probably linkies making party hack chainlink works permissioned system trusts entities behave intended
337245,inv would set require oracle update permissioned governance almost 0 chance happening would execute oracle update public mempool got frontrunned attack vector without attacker able update oracle
337247,frax pretty small 25b market cap compared dai 10b considering much attention frax gets cmc show token 205 25b top 60 cmc hates frax fxs seemed like good low buy 4pool news still seems expensive
337248,case expensive unscalable still permissioned bandaid perhaps redundant attack still possible permissionless system relied keepers whichever version
337249,bridge frax ust metis help get
337250,yes would allow transaccion triggered public mempool
337251,cost goes exponential need betting update transaction would arrive rug liquidity pool several blocks
337252,dola peg already nearly restored thanks increased borrow rates response demand drop 
337253,we'll continue raise rates across lending protocols dola 1 within next couple hours
337254,dang thats conviction sounds like dola good hands good luck
337255,hey nour get reasoning want get audit surely time arrived least consider one dust settles would really help professional set eyes look code dismiss findings can't deny useful process undertake pulling spite difficulties indeed impressive ways might prevent happening first place
337256,issue would caught audit volatility risk issue code exploit i'm finding alternative audits using defi olympiads experiment thanks bringing tho
337257,clear i'm corporate audits always get community reviewers look critical code
337258,pretty sure trail bits would caught least mentioned report consider comment economic well code relatedexploits top audit firms would definitely catch regardless great work responding situation quick impressive
337259,yeah remember discussing harry raised valid points low quality audits leading false sense user security
337260,context attack conducted would accountable auditor combination decreased pair liquidity mev games arbitrage inefficiency
337261,someone whos gotten multiple tob audits recurring annual contract confidently say would opinion tob one best firms space though im saying others would find debate good work response quick remediation especially peg consider tob good
337262,thank recommendation sam i'll genuinely consider
337263, page 13 identifies mev exploit sam paid tob maybe lol really take many different things account
337264,yeah kudos due otherwise good processes place deal impressed reaction speed otherwise

337296,aave fam invite take look vote fresh snapshot proposal get lido stmatic collateral polygon aave v3 
337297,arent kinds exploits also possible raris fuse pools mean use small coins collaterals surely theres chainlink oracle collaterals
337298,yep happens time lol use v3 twaps low cap pools easily exploited lending pools isolated though users encouraged use low liq ones 
337299,lowliq v3 pool even easier manipulate push price outside main liquidity ticks effectively make price infinite twap interval doesnt help much case v2 imagine twap interval used correctly inverse hack would way difficult impossible
337300,everybody knows fuse pools exploitable still keep hoping hackers nice ignore loot thats taking
337301,wtf 
337302,permissionless anyone create fuse pool
337307,love see
337308,see multichain tvl frax
337309, new comer battle field
337310,
337311,better plan cvx purchasing bribing 
337312,sympathize nour good postmortem media coverage plus building bear learned lot goalpost shifting shitting everyone sad weird agenda around toxic hell standing strong beliefs okay always reads like shit better criticism designs hate anything hope frens try critical designs approaches doesnt appear toxic rude cause sorry would change cool like
337313, samczsun ser wut happened poly bad lol
337314,yeah let explain somewhere isnt twitter
337315,want use weth matic
337316,expectation bridge eth matic use gasless swap get matic takes 10 minutes im done
337317,reality bridge eth matic gasless swap work metamask says signature long 1024 there's native trezor connect option rpc fails 90% time header found straight returns 429
337318,either find friend give matic pay mainnet gas fees buy bridge single matic sell eth stables bridge stables buy eth matic
337319,fuck
337320,last 60 minutes life
337321,sent swap tx rpc im pretty sure vanished void
337322,confirm rpc using
337323,polygonrpccom 
337324,fantom bit similar experience sad cause anon faucet helped throwing shade devs bought ftm wanted swap around multichain liquidity back aggregators didnt anything result either main one anyway found 10 ftm one bridge swapped received wftm could use gas fees great find faucet said multichain swap never used fantom get gas fees
337325,whatever autoprompted switch
337326,reason lmao
337327,thats old one sir use polygonrpccom
337328,even latest docs mention one preffered
337329,u try step new one please
337330,ended getting matic friends im set next time time spare ill try
337331,checked sites visited none tried add maticvigil rpc assume loaded research matic however long ago
337332,thats good least
337333,actually couldnt leave
337334,tried gasless swap
337337,trezor assuming
337338,yes
337339,huh what's rude tweet goal post shifting still think curve wars dumb
337340,toxic disagreeing status quo
337341,curve wars dumb causing billions dollars liquidity wasted sitting around nothing tiny daily volumes whole game maximizing liquidity sake liquidity optics looking huge makes sense fine i'm left choice year going 100% organic path 15m bad debt paid i'll play
337342,best luck navigating situation watching part w admiration wasnt dunking concrete case messaging across board making comment tough criticize anyones anything wo appearing toxic often calling friendsrainbowunicorns dont hate others succeed ser
337344,despite initial concerns still decided join dark side
337345,1 i've spent entire day exactly asking 2 attack far vanilla involving 3m capital cost attacker significant risk manoeuvring mev botsarbitragers deep understanding keep3r twap oracles flaws 3 spend time however want say whatever want 
337346,ser nice say assume dev spend enough time creation critical designs okay long good faith blabla doesnt mean cant hand hand coding learning designs also good understanding
337347,case incentivising vecrv holders right seems good job liquidity vlcvx holders risk premium dola significantly wonder apy pool actually recapitalise something market decide
337348,attack definitely nontrivial quite interesting study also
337349,lesser two evils evil would dying slow death trying organically build volumes dola pressure 15m debt simply impossible build long term confidence stability stablecoin protocol 15m losses due
337350,i'd context using curve v2 pools price oracles think need something prevent similar attacks used en masse especially smaller pools
337351,data capital efficiency vecrv vs vlcvx bribes
337352,nobodys tried manipulate yet abra cauldrons ones using afaik
337353,also tips timing votes better allocate bribes early vs later sorry i'm kinda new 
337354,llamaairforce stats votium think tweet good job comparing two approaches 
337355,couldnt find curvewars talk inverse discord look
337356,initially shared option twitter space since contributors going though different strategies internally
337357,think today proposals presented
337358,thoughts 'bribes' see like business deal protocols vecrv holders drive inflation towards new construction project defi lending platform interfacing via liquidity pool say abra bdeal curvedao 'bribes' mim3crv pool receive curve inflation benefits abra curve time right curve funding vyperlang someone could easily 'bribe' vecrv holders vote favor vyperlang fundraising gauge bit like decentralised monetary policy experiment today's best use case amm one day may fund ethereum devs via protocol guild anyone interested funding could simply interface votium better vote vecrv vlcvx hating 'curve wars' misses opinion
337359,whoever zapper airdrop w nfts idk saying make sure exclude address destinations see disperse sybilling around fyi 
337360,kept saying twitter could easily cover cause dola best designed stable inverse cash
337361,nour's communication could use work nowhere stated would easily done said unless take additional capital vc mantra want compromise future growth long painful road ahead make users whole good luck team
337362,could use work quite understatement heh
337363,sure crv gauge architecture feeling perhaps 'intent' solidly essence could protocol agnostic gauges anything requires incentivisation whether particular protocol's liquidity unilp metapool tied actual exchange gitcoin grants continuous protocol development etc
337364,thats already curve gauges agnostic funds current infra accommodates amm pools additional fundraising gauge vyperlang theyre getting approx 30k usd week funding use build amazing things collaboration trailofbits definitely limited people thought
337365,sure im also talking fuse pools created rari teamtribedao also use uni twaps right
337366,provide twap oracle attack tool anyone use euler oracleeulerfinance tells exactly much would cost attacker move twap given length given number blocks given % example raise 30 minute twap price uni 20% using 2 block attack would cost 648m contrast would cost 185m perform attack yfi 25k perform attack mim want explore current attack costs quickly display oracle rating appeulerfinance search using toolbar hover oracle rating see current attack costs
337367,send messages transactions
337368,anywhere get bit info see numbers ser
337369,
337370,works afaik eulers collateralliquidation system like auction time need respond prices instantly cant using average
337371,math person saying bs apeir99n help
337372,thanks sers 
337373,cool thanks info going dig implementation
337374,
337375,vefunder implementation specs there's max emisisons beyond gauge becomes dry votes gauge thereafter burns crv there's receiver address append logic receiver address could contract calls crv minter contract distributes inflation arbitrary logic 
337377,vezza95 see info
337379,here's example ui hover oracle rating see estimates attack costs even markets listed euler search search bar providing active weth pair market uni v3 present coingecko token list see roughly might cost
337381,i'm curious figure nour fixed attack vectors feeling might understand attack worked though must said counter nour's earlier point huge liquidity pools would made significantly difficult andor costly silver lining 
337383,protocols allow take loan yieldbearing instruments abracadabra sure feel like heard others
337384,think fiatdao offers
337385,fixed interest assets
337386,max working launching fe
337387,curve 3 pool little 1 token problem
337388,
337389,basis trade larry says rug
337390,think 4pool proposal ust frax folks missing main point algo stables aim replace centralize parties like usdc usdt better stable currency defi native defi already risking inclusion centralized stables 3pool dai ust frax better ecosystem whole current 4pool
337391,sure verifiable alameda famous delta neutral farming tbh surprised true
337392,tend delta neutral hyped stuff later borrow underlying nuke spot closing longs
337393,market maker charity worker
337394,mention charity anywhere
337395,frax terra going work maker collaborate provide incentives
337396,think usdc usdt providing incentives even matter like maker enable curve lp token daiustfrax new collateral type needed
337397,shouldnt incentives temporarily tools adoption
337399,defo basis trade imo
337400,maker continue getting free lunch
337401,improve liquidity algo stables free lunch
337402,4p could liquidity providers get benefits 
337403,work negative values
337404,nigh unlikely someone selling decentralized anything straightface genuinely missing point
337405,totally get frax majorly backed usdc risky lping usdc instead dai
337406,true reliance usdc usdt go away
337407,

337415,ill post becsuse many influencers protocol operators strengthen defi already seen regulators putting screws centralized exchanges quest ban unhosted wallets ust backed btc centralized manner tge 4 pool omits truly decentralized assets favor driving higher usdc dominance one thinks getting bed circle bad news permissionless finance
337416,think people agree
337417,doesnt need specifically strengthen defi ethos long keeps narrators story rich narrate accordingly
337418,nothing utmost respect teams especially frax something whole btc ust ust frax things starting sound little big fail
337419,arent frax team incentivizing pool containing lusd struggling gain adoption could use leg

337441,usdn seems lost peg possibly due recent fud wonder motive behind vote
337442,people exiting pool due fud
337443,looking great usdn recover imo
337444,yield also going higher less people pool 21%
337445,hey lobs anybody got ressources password strength regarding difference password uppercasenormal letters numbers special characters comparison 35 word find government info makes sceptical
337446,answer always depends
337447,five word password generally going easier remember least equivalent security memorable jumble symbols etc
337448,obviously password equivalent length 100% random characters entropy
337449,human cannot remember 25 character long string completely random garbage
337450,memorize six word bip39 seed call day
337451,yeah thats issue im wanna use passeord manager mfa use strong passwords logins use strong password manager may forget loose access theory would make sense use master password guess wordlist attacks would make easy crack since secret phrase wallets seem work fine guess feasable enough thanks input bip39 good searchterm
337452,find needing dd someone claims worked andre something chance anyone help reach andre reference check
337453,someone says worked andre 99% scam andres semifrens never say worked andre

337500,mim recovered
337501,usdn shall recover well
337502,overlyhigh supposed used veryveryvery correlated assets price difference basis points mim proven least volatile thus lower warranted imo
337503,well tokenschains something sustainable expect eth
337504,definitely exit pump waves 6 years going exit obviously
337505,mean exit scam exit liquidity party created rally taking profit
337506,ah gotcha
337507,exit liquidity also used big waves holders everyone else would wait swap 7 days
337508,many hot new super liquid curve pools feel like houses cards
337509,keep reading erc 1155 spec think i'm missing something ownership erc 1155 nft appears emitted log event actually stored chain contracts can't read logs events there's way within evm determine whether address owns erc 1155 nft owner given erc1155 nft would also mean transfer erc1155 nft would performed trusted intermediary erc docs refer operator address operator freely transfer nft managed erc1155 contract address want also implies user owns erc1155 nft would get contract operator transfer nft behalf actually nft contract operator take away time tried googling seems like nobody talks people even consider erc1155 web3 even real nft matter literally permissioned database published chain

337666,can't stop misleading people since horrible retroactive airdrop 
337667,usdn ded
337668,openzeppelin security research team along convex anonymous developers agreed best course action dilemma incorporate additional publicly known parties multisig making rugpull impossible
337669,basically oz like embellish stories
337671,go anon signer public one let keep wallet meme
337672,anyone used thought read usage nft represent private equity
337674,oz unprofessional way handled discovery process article also misleading
337675,multisig fully anonymous either that's also lie
337676,reads like clickbait written confused marketer
337677,miss something thing changed adding public person persons multisig
337678,strange article
337679,also convex dev team uncover vulnerability oz disclose anonymous

337703,general understanding question head cant comprehend wouldnt every protocol join curve wars long bribes earnings isnt effectively free moneyapy either treasury andor holders lping miss
337704,cause protocols dont gain anything deep liquidity books doesnt make revenue
337705,isnt emission bribe protocol would collect somewhat positive revenue stream
337706,emissions go lps doesnt achieve much anyway vague context stablecoins probably likely ye else tho
337707,protocol owned liquidity lp treasury bribe collect emissions sell increase treasury rinse repeat
337708,take step back ser exactly achieving bringing pol lp unless missed point
337709,dmed maybe head really burning crashing right

337822,best interact ignore transfer chances approving something
337823,interacted wanted know there's way remove said tokens
337824,remove means set balance 0 requires kind transfer burn token erc20applicable likely malicious transfer method might contain something alongside actual transfer unlikely another token approved attacker modern erc20 approval implementations eg openzepp checks msgsender eliminates possibility called explicitly user better interact double check contracts transfer burn method youre sure underlying codebase transfer burn still better seek ui solutions hide tokens eg mms assets list modified
337825,thanks
337828,jchervinsky retweeted good news defi bad news garygensler case binance last week judge ruled binance didnt sufficient contacts considered operating unregistered exchange us

337831,
337832,assume error
337833,forget happens yea error
337834,em get what's error
337835,guessing part costs almost full eth
337837,hey guys sorry bother hacked usdc metamask tx hash wallet hacker idea incan manage something
337840,hope bother yall would curious know guess 
337841,second tweet says heavily overcollateralized 240% anyone info whats total liquidity waves token redemption event people unlikely would like keep waves would heavily dumped traders natually would expect exchaning waves something fundamental like btceth whats total % fundametal assets overall econsystem waves im trying fud dont motivation curious purely numbers methodology calcs numbers specifically ust model usdn
337842,usdn waves redemptions happen smart contract without link orderbookscentralized exchanges thing 'mark price' based main wavesusdt pairs
337843,even tomorrow overcollateralization drops example 120%
337844,would directly impact wavesusdt would impact traders
337845,swaps get triggered get executed random time period 24h
337846,smart contract essentially plays orderbook
337847,sure answers question
337848,think instant need obscene amount nsbt meaningful arbitrage hence tweet inal changing parameters allow arbitrage
337849, check stats smart contract
337850,yeah that's issue
337851,think that's addressed properly it'll balance
337852,yes changed new system time storm lol
337853,meant centralize process looks like idiotic decision since no1 arbitrage
337854,meant counter arbitrage abused curve pool iirc countered arbitrage 
337855,fud related permanent depeg event unsubstantial way enough collateral back usdn
337856,long fix usability bridge
337857,q find profitable path dex without using ui 1 look existing token pairs initial token 2 map probable paths 3 query paths find profitable 'optimal path' function
337859,dijikstra's algorithm good place start
337860,referring uniswap using heuristic method code pretty readable also wanna use sdk docs 
337861,thanks look
337865,
337876,okay share project wanna shill pd got grant european union led researchers artists kinda defi moon nothing imo interesting i'd curious collect feedbacks 
337881,appchain crosschain
337883,like dfk mainnet imx
337884,yes
337885,l1 exhausted
337886,l2 appchain blow
337887,crosschain narrative
337888,brains blow
337889,barely know appchain
337890,think narrative
337891,could call dydx appchain
337892,fat protocol thesis true
337893,
337894,dydx earned hundreds million 
337895,could see much paid eth
337896,would consider parachains dotsama ecosystem appchain
337897,yes sir
337898,avax subnet atom dot
337899,could call appchains
337900,osmosis dex appchain
337901,acala defi appchain
337902,avax subnet seems lowest cost appchain atom needs connect ibc dot needs lot money becoming parachain
337903,lmao could banned ivangbi flushing
337904,nah okay u fine ser
337905,dapps become bigger think chain sure
337906,
337907,dont think app chain thing think itll app agnostic optimized chains natively bridge
337908,never understood polkadot auctions slots allows parachains become pretty close app specific instead launch large amount interconnected common goods chains
337909,let know anyone wants hire smart contract developer erc20 erc721
337910,benefits appchain
337911,appchains allow developers customize applications terms governance structure economic design underlying consensus algorithm appchain selfgoverned economy codedefined explicit processes reach agreements protocol upgrades
337912,cosmosibc future
337913,like dfk subnet solve jewel inflation problem
337914,yeah agreed see one chain per app scale vs common optimized chains example dfk need chain need gaming optimized one low decentralizatin high transaction throughput
337915,somehow figure highly reliable highly secure highly fast easy use bridges i'd agree definitely see happening though
337916,relates blockchain trilemma l1 couldnt handle dapp need find scaling solution
337917,become appchain 
337918,nah necessarily example dot one parachain super low collator count effectively accomplishing without needing build bridges etc
337919,security problem appchain validator 1 team
337920,allow app specific parachain slots gets used bunch random projects might go anywhere
337921,made thread fits ct topos aka might quite degens part core hopefully sums things well give good first glance leveraging crypto nfts design economy undermine funding issues tradart b question act collecting live art end thread there's github docs links leave introduction i'd really happy collect feedbacks willing share really like guys seem well aware need position listen take feedbacks account genuinely wanna meet new minds new mindsets kinda cool
337922,punch made typos thread ahah frenchies ans english long story
337923,sounds like building game engine make game worse os make app
337924,question eth20l2 experts several l2s fees tokens metisbobanii able become eth20 shards true optimistic rollups arbitrumoe able
337925,dont know need time see
337926,well like osmosis dydx dfk 
337927,agreed also question many differently optimized chains need build games certainly must level makes sense
337928,there's nothing unique unprecedented people think app devs interested faffing around consensus like make app people selling socalled app chains
337929,gotta verify audit chain code smart contracts
337930,oh claim coming 
337931,delegate u ivan
337932,vote exit dao give money
337933,sounds good much pay delegators
337934,mean alameda research says provide market making services essentially buy good portion supply makes continuous buys sells essentially always top bid ask orderbook
337935,top close maintain tight spread larger orders happen without moving market much also prevents massive abritrage oppose one scamware cex depegs another actually volume well reality arb yeah
337936,okay one side like possible service provides liquidity sells letting buys volatile
337937,ask even decide tell first place opaque also depends work require notional capital thenother side book use like wintermute time period profit split engagement directionally think asset usually cant mm invest semantics basically wont find looking trying deduct behavior sheer involvement mms magic
337938,mm means providing spread ask bids takes make market
337939,playbook get lent tokens mm fine carry risk get spread also usually get given free option receive tokens say 6month price k
337940,quite interesting thanks
337941,sounds like dumb question think various protocols offering smart contracts service scaas uniswap provides scaas form permissionless liquidity pools anyone deploy combination 2 erc20 tokens gnosis safe provides scaas proxy implementation new proxy contracts deployed created point canonical gnosis safe interface contract contains logic needed transactions would reasons two different forms people deploy smart contracts would happen uniswap used proxy implementation liquidity pools instead
337942,hey guys name jeremy bragin film producer currently working docuseries one russias largest vod platforms im looking connect lobsterdao team possibly get touch

337966,scammy rug wow
337967,yo peeps whats cost effective way get access eth node without running read data blockchain need able serve peaks traffic tens thousands users peak times i'm told using infura alchemy rack thousands fees using rpcs essentially need provider users dont metamask havent connected yet
337968,quicknode perhaps
337969,need access archive node 
337970,opinions creating community owned etherscan alternative
337971,super complex stuff requires constant maintaince hard monetize basically worst thing probably
337972,archive node needed
337973,that's art wdym
337974,huge infrastructure cost without easy plan monetization work community based project
337976,daaamn im glad asked postpone thinking thank

338075,anyone knows get hundred ropsten eth
338076,hellsing inu
338077,project working developing play earn game primarily rewards nfts usable gameitems ingame instead token that's need eth
338078, here's demo game want idea looks like
338079,hi convex holders bribed fxs vote guage yield lockcvx still need vote daily delegate
338080,wow looks old school hehe multiplayer
338081,see point nfts rewards game multiplayer competition pvp
338082,spotted cool tool daos3 
338083,first solo campaigns space needs continuos updates people think working hard enough yeah multiplayer ultimate goal ingame mechanics called portal essentially type coordinates go multiple worlds within game portals would used introduce multiplayer system game
338084,would cool something like soulslike invasion style may bosses haha
338085,defo like idea would invest tbh
338086,bosses
338087,that's hell portal
338088,well token know many people like idea taxed tokens soon nft series essentially find coordinates monster solving ingame puzzles defeat procedurally generated monster whitelisted minting
338089,crypto man token economies everywhere people group created way meaningless tokens judged token value worry thats opinion
338090,oh yeah sure different pitch different communities though really planning shilling here's website want check us 
338091,seems like would really benefit rmrk nfts going held back erc721 looks great can't wait try gaming resurgence making miss gaming 
338092,actually going ahead erc1155 erc721 yet stage make final decision wrong rmrk polkadot right
338093,btw want try playable demo bit rough around edges bugs still fun prealpha dm email enable access
338094,evm contracts testing rust pallets mvp state currently run colored coins mode aiming cover much ground possible happy show around plenty games already developing us one diablo like thing one thing similar single player experience course skybreach thing happy explore options collabing
338095,oh interesting really deep dived polkadot solutions mostly concentrating developing ecosystem around application specific rollup definitely intrigues
338096,hey ivangbi what's conditions eligible claim 
338097,lol thx actually know gear claim
338098,delegate cryptojohnbooneeth
338099,always ready paranoidal low level decentralisation cryptoweb3defi stablecoins affected usas decisions usdc data storage rely centralized products node networks dependence centralized infrastructure etc time almost definative products rely decentralised governance means token holders power largest token holders biggest defiprotocols much power brief analysis ethplorer snapshot shows picture example uni aave dydx 175m8m holdings one biggest token holderaverage number votes last proposals uni 15m250k aave 25m25m dydx guess one biggest token holder binance least wallets tagged ethplorer binances understand binance token holder participate governance though usually cexs dont binance would want become malicious actor power propose first suspend withdrawals stake govtokens needed vote malicious proposal hurt defiecosystem yes shouldnt look binance cexs like potential single points failure defiworld hope mistake logic
338100,i've mentioned couple times really hope long term crypto moves away token voting bicameral system like house senate one side votes straight tokens one side 1 vote per unique human guess small minimum token requirement things pass get passed
338101,obviously would make decision making even way slower already see board directors elected way maybe even liquid voting users delegate tokens directors
338102,kind polkadot works right ways gotta say loving
338103,proposal interesting terms centralizationdecentralization 
338104,works really well systems enough validator room lowcapacity validator systems much whales tend make bunch validators push everyone
338105,yeah combine random selection block producer boom higher decentralization lower incentives run many nodes
338106,agree lot different ways improve voting system chosing way traditional llc works board directors etc exotic methods though moment i'm interested question problem mentioned really exists yes looks strange we're trying decentralize democratize almost everything talking fear governments amazon etc time whole system affected one person cz
338107,clear system would rely sort unique personhood thing yet exist
338108,there's personhood voting dot right token voting board directors understand teh technical board actually replaced token vote
338109,really democratizing governance definition oligarchizing time that's likely best 100% believe need move forward
338110,tricameral theory plebs council technical committee practice really proof personhood despite us knowing people council tech committee actual unique people really help regards technical decentralization decision making
338111,much released internally mean start 100m right away released 2m circulation per week fast
338112,making personhood voting substrate chain though biometric consensus layer
338113,ah yeah guess theory plebs would split plebs lots tokens plebs 1 tokens
338114,yeah that'd super cool basis bicameral house senate type voting system personally think representative democracy work better direct democracy lower level decision making think there's good arguments
338115,works basically plebs either many tokens use vote interesting antiwhale mechanics voting system whole kinda broken right revamped
338116,i'll check realize nouance thanks
338117,love trying make progress towards actual democracy seems like everyone else content oligarchy strategy probably oligarchs
338118,yeah pending change coming different tracks councils different parts chains aspects vs one council everything one tech committee everything ideally councils specialize etc
338119,plus antisniping added proposals sure day one
338120,ah interesting sounds like swiss style governance 7 presidents executive board directors specializes one 7 departments
338121,see dms ser
338122,convinced also need deliberative branch randomly selected holders
338123,
338124,think liquid token voting delegate tokens people redelecte time likely better outcome hard get random people speed end something similar us jury trials really known particularly consistent
338125,actually research bit nuanced 
338126,think mixed system liquid democracy representative deliberative solid
338127,goal able integrate complexity human governance crypto ream go beyond liberal democracies ok far far good
338128,disagreeing commenting 10 different jurys exact trial youd likely end 10 consistent verdicts issue good decision quality engage public
338129,yeah agree comparing think good compare also existing mechanism parliaments also good habit come 10 different solutions confronted issue question % epistemic vs social process achieve
338130,deliberative processes good begin epistemic
338131,working policial matters
338132,lol fair point
338133,guys recommend proxy provider static ips paid crypto
338134,remind point goal
338136,think sending people piece paper walk physical location get fill another paper throw box endgame
338137,better previous generations simple
338138,exactly endgame
338139,probably see people building software supposedly immutable db
338140,
338141,problems collaborating frontender implementing dapp based smart contracts wrote ie parameters clear something work etc created docs partially helps ever problem guys go
338142,living planet managing extremely difficult goal balancing individual freedom desire happiness common responsibility planetary boundaries questing infinite story better governance
338146,lol least there's self awareness
338147, important
338148,usually go call people walk different questions either works shows trouble understanding documentation lies adjust
338149,think blockchain ever solve issues related governance that's like saying internet enabling ease communication make people better communicators
338150,meant solve governance issues support process make robustverifiableefficient
338151,yeah that's i'm actually debugging point badmouth dev best thinking would cool tool exports sample projectdocs based natspec kind like swagger fe shows call given functions sample params point easier help 
338152,think trick tehcnogoly able many tech support social process
338153,yeah much else party lacks essential skillsknowledge babysittrain replace
338154,know that's i'm saying though rails facilitate efficiency governance process cannot solve issues governance unrelated efficiency governance process likely compound make even glaringly obvious
338155,depends experience level frontend dev new web3 think would prefer give typescript wrapper takes care setting plumbing exposes interface makes easier consume frontend app
338156,that's really interesting understand correctly ts would wrap smart contract function calls expose typesafe interface would act documentation sorts see working completely new case level keep idea mind
338157,yep exactly treat almost blackbox separation concerns experience makes updates uiux modular
338158,
338159,
338160,mean something like typechain even wrapped
338161,depends need honestly generally prefer bit wrapped keep surface interface minimal expose stuff absolutely need frontend scenarios typechain good enough
338162,maybe crazy question project founders accounting platform use im trending quick books im used anything better crypto
338163,ideally something ingest transactions fireblocks
338164,seems interesting involved consortium
338165,way make bid items specific art blocks collection looksrare allows collection bid entirety art blocks considered collection since pieces come smart contract
338166,defi fixed income projects currently traction approach makes sense

338390,inverse shorter list
338392,data much audits done auditor could take account % protocols hacked audit mean certik accounts 7 hacked projects audits made audits 90% defi projects makes completely different situation audited 7 projects 7 hacked
338393,power marketing huh
338394,stories followings effective tools web3
338395,contracts state time audit intentional fud chart 
338396,
338397,taken
338398,contract state valid consideration nonetheless however long projects allowed slap certik logo ui lul users false sense security i'm sure value 
338399,
338402,true would useful metamask whatever wallet could verify contract audited prior transacting
338403,pretty useless chart without putting relation total amounts audits done information whether attack vector within audited scope also would normalize data bunch factors tvlpopularity audited projects auditor get auditor x bad hack common meme anyone actually approached scientific methodology
338404,mention auditor could made recommendations team follow
338405,precisely assuming project audited certik post contract owner private key twitter go chart certik audited hacks
338406,topic security concerns general way nuanced 99% people talking recognize
338407,elaborate
338408,read
338409,happened sdt 
338410,audits marketing tools i've done due dilligence feel confident investing protocol matter anyone scientific research funds still got stolen faith auditor looking project interacted still got fucked auditors reputation line project approve gets rekt protocol follow recommendations write audit report actually read findings audit company allow protocol say audited several versions behind etc
338411,think making something something complicated needs
338412,audits marketing tools abused marketing purposes marketing certainly main concern audit auditors reputation line project approve gets rekt mean protocol follow recommendations write audit report dead end even project complies recommendations way auditor verify keep future means effectively revoke audited
338413,think one people trying simplify level honor reality whole audited projects gets hacked auditor blamementality account bunch scenarios
338414,expect problems arise audit data back hypothesis
338415,search bootcamp session
338418,audit says dev single key rug whole thing audit says luks gud k tnx bye yes
338419,problem many audit firms prioritize code bugs economic exploits certainly audit team opsec audited projects keep getting hacked
338420,also get pay
338421,audits created equal
338422,marketing may main concern certainly part reputation line self explanatory different people chat saying touch cream 10 ft pole exploited several times waves ponzi insert story there's little ambiguous even contracts public cared verify time exploit

338426,pretty damn cool
338427,uni v3 liquidity mining 
338428,sounds retarded fuck
338430,lol
338431,think basic implementation idea
338432,guessing make really viable take effort tinkering
338433,hack funds contract guarantees 10% hacked funds
338434,simplify audit process team building automated tool intention vetting 5060% issues development stage project lifecycle happy conversation anyone looking try
338435,arbitrager thing seems bit wonky id bet many hackers opt guaranteed 10%
338436,happens 10% marketcap project
338437,means hack already happened fund user fund r rekt address set third party also might want fee otherwise address hacker even 
338438,larping marketing good one jfc
338439,idk maybe milkyklim vshvsh consider product fine idk
338440,apeir99n thots
338441,what's difference escrow contract
338442,
338443,wonder way automatically put owner project multisig
338444,probably
338445,stupid
338446,10% hacker normalized i'm switching gamedev
338447,onchain offchain
338448,tabletop
338449,nightmare pr crypto media report hack without including recovery details regulators pull examples crypto scam
338450,think generalize discussion white vs black hat people choose black hat 10% higher white hat bug bounty cases nonexistant compared 10%
338451,first step hacker would nope bounce
338452,btw whats best way launder 600 mil asking fren
338453,start olympus fork
338455,joke works
338456,would know
338457,50 different addresses lping uni v3 position hacker wallet swapped stolen stuff senslessly fro eth random shitcoin collect fees whitewashed money 
338458,idea they're supposed turn white 10% make 25%
338459,compare bounties claimed immunefi example theoretical payouts
338460,idea better position negotiate someone balls hand
338461,best irrelevant correlation
338462,hacked already u already balls
338463,goal make shit able get 10% wo hacking protocol fud
338464,product makes 0 sense
338465,automatically send tornado wallet hacker designates programmable escrow tornado built
338466,10% clean money 25% dirty 
338467,would know
338468,suppose could implemented
338469,say i'm okay 1% relevant actual blackhat vs borderline flipflopper imagining
338470,empirical data ser many hackers decided go route instead otherwise
338471,go ahead provide data
338472,cant
338473,playing idea getting others contribute make better maybe stage community convarge around
338474,kinda add anything project offering 10% per normal disclosure
338475,normalize 10% theft
338476,projects rarely offer 10% b offer whatever hacker disclosed vulnerability happened many many times project essentially tells fuck reducing severity delaying payments etc
338477,stuff chance beginning make sense tvl meaningful relationship marketcap projects handful projects defillamacom marketcap 10% tvl including top 2 even bad 1%
338478,course offer ridiculous
338479,agreed faced similar kind situation couple times
338480,hacked wormhole thorchain etc immdiately offer 10% bounty
338481,curve gets hacked they're worth tomorrow 10% 2b that's want pay flipflopping blackhats
338482,hacker tornados away gain
338483,quick death vs slow one making fraud feel good
338484,hacker spend next however long figuring make 2b tornadoed funds something actually spend
338485,looking shoulder rest lives
338486,hmm even calculate 10% tvl liquid money certainly capital team's control
338487,already got tweet suggesting add log function amount know going usable
338488,least gave 90% back makes sleep better night
338489,incentive problem adding smart contract change anything hacker control funds choose whether accept projects offer
338490,18b slow death either way trying best damage control point negotiating imperfect human part job
338491,imperfect one thing pretentious fraud another
338492,% high going change mind take 25% project still gets 75% back
338493,75% large number
338495,
338496,instead giving someone literally billions even millions instead make police report start investigating massive billions dollars stolen cash
338497,like lmao idea going launder 20b tornado
338498,maybe they'll open 10k eth contract
338499,arbitrary numbers point give thief free money give back money stole instead track thief stop old fashioned way
338500,everyone interested guy literally stole twenty billion dollars
338501,like spend
338502,10% bullshit maybe makes sense theft 1m
338503,negotiate imperfect human giving free money absolution
338504,make work oh stole 20b i'm really interested see going turn something usable willywonkajpg
338505,even think authorities competent 20b bounty real life blackhats
338506,there's 20b account guy control think 5 wrenches coming way
338507,multisigs good prevent compromise single keys turning power high value account they're also good deter opportunists seeing target knock get candy inside
338508,yes something 20b going attract nationstate tier attackers point kinds people actually pulloff simultaneous assaults multisig
338509,nation state care give back 90% either
338510,they'll take 20b
338511,yeah point protocol ownership 100% abandoned protocols existence nearly 30b tvl governed 35 multisigs
338512,impoverished 3rd world country lot money plenty guns people value lives i'd look see softtarget

338519,
338520,
338521, psa starsagora exploit metis 
338523,looks like everything alright suggest checking access another pc incognito someone might able generate malicious valid cert like kakao recently tornado cash see 
338524,maybe one browser extensions compromised testing one one
338526,reproduce incognito normally extensions disabled incognito
338527,unless enabled specifically
338528,looks like get incognito enabled metamask incognito
338529,okay testing bit even got incognito
338530,could please record video screenshot send dm everyone give update chat well
338531,im contact tornado cash team rn double check ps attack observed yet looks like someone reported relay avast thus avast highlighting phishing relayers decentralised maybe one operators abusing others make users use relay emailed avast get info
338532,okay
338534,yes ligma deez
338539, exit liquidity bit hyperbole otherwise contains interesting metrics
338542,well product algo stable working mechanism keeps peg would pay incentivise sink

338554,anyone else noticed larping choosing eth reserve smart contract platform competition means could replaced unlike btc goes add avax reserve anyway marketing reserve stability imo
338555,actually surprised would add avax reason
338556,may well see add others moving forward
338557,high fees high fungibility high sustainability low fragility good price support eth wins rest way eos etc went

338569,lot chats first weeks token launch try look back chat history
338570,potion unlock tldr game theory behind unlocking early vs late
338571,significant part codebase holdout demand certain things else wont release ur part secret unlocked early think got bonus sorts
338572,oh potions needed unlock use get tokens minimum needed finish launch would able hold entire system ransom interesting
338574,max 90 days team decide unlock code anyway game unlock community build community project
338575,holding 90 days quite painful launch
338576,also 'most rare nfts' redundancy 2 meaning code hold unlock also 1 nft one needs unlock part code available hold 1 category take chances play hard ball hope duplicates idea community unlocks creative way instead holding protocol hostage 90 days

338641,soon action results increased market cap competitor crypto biz dev teams warm copy machines let guess offering anchor yield 1% said stables
338643, 05% ser
338644,though anchor protocol apy decreases increase
338647,

338655,stripe released fy21 annual report good fintech read 
338656,good takes 
338657,upcoming l1 stablecoin war usn near vs ust terra assuming usn uses collateralbased mechanism sounds like could really dominate ust imagine 2 banks issuing bank notes stablecoin bank takes basket assets deposit collaterals issues iou banknotes that's proportion deposit riskier asset lower proportion case bank run high market volatility liquidate assets unwind iou ensures bank notes always redeemable equivalent value assets bank b promising upstart issued stock native token issues equivalent value iou bank notes hand stock guarantee someone wants cash bank notes always create new bank stocks equivalent value pay back bank's equity supply elastic essentially stock buy back good times stock splits pay ious bad times idea bank sounds revolutionary seems never unable pay back debts go insolvency shame see something like tradfi yet u given choice user holding bank notes bank bank b giving 20% yields would pick sound throw sweetener bank b's yields scheduled come soon think would happen case anyone gets confused bank would near i'm speculating mechanism bank b would terra
338658,isnt l1 stablecoin war ust cannot sustain without outside funds
338661,risks downward spiral luna waiting watch happens lower yields
338662,l1 stablecoin wars probably happen since fraxust 2 biggest players already ust buying select l1 tokens like btc avax frax buying l1 tokens proportional much frax used chain we're natively issuedmintable 12 different chains sure good idea start stablecoin scratch instead ustfrax issue natively mainnet buy l1 token fraxust friends expand chain double demand l1 token
338663,lol
338664,
338665,agreed bribes properly working mode would work concept design issue execution issue
338666,plans work centrifuge regards realworld assets
338667,notion l1 war probably ethereum king forever frax also seems much smaller dai atm i'm trying attack frax fact think frax interesting mechanism would definitely choose ust day seems really unfortunate would want tie fate frax ust ride coattails
338668,usn 20% yield 
338669,making native stable coin best way keep ecosystem value distributing profits investors affecting others
338670,pegged first 
338671,
338672,user acquisition

338685,bizdevgrowth guy good would like another kind person
338686,thank dmed sir 
338687,youre person personal intro well
338688,hi everyone received dappnode yesterday playing got gnosis offer 4 gno stake cool wondering also run tornado relayer would love privacy decentralization future cool stuff cli bla bla wondering would need least 300torn that's quite lot portfolio adquire anyone experience running relayer
338689,think better run gno validators almost 17pc apr
338690,happens onceif btc alts making another 50% dip 
338691,leverage destroys smaller players
338692,ust backed btc alts value tho safety measure stop death spiral luna sell happens ust technically backed assets
338693,stables mechanisms use frax ust there's already dai integrated everywhere users get option choice better alternatives rise capture market share
338694,technically yes correct market psychology player aka alameda might try play game
338695,interesting project im producing podcast narrativestoryfocused nft initiatives live performancestorytelling aspect project mention artist enablement mechanisms interesting dm discuss theres potential might interested team show thanks
338696,anyone know leveraged yield meant work struggling figure profit funding
338697,like selling margin farm
338698,dont funding rates borrow rates sorry silly note rates imbalance great question 1 markets never ever anywhere efficient even boomer good information asymmetry 2 even information perfect risk perceived differently passive lps would rather make lower apy susceptible liquidations different risk tolerance 3 making yields converge crosschain still early af stage 4 etc
338699,case abracadabra works like 1 abracadabra lets one mint abra's stablecoin mim yielding position 2 one swap mim yielding position process repeats abra nice ui process automatically margin comes growing liqudation risk
338700,multiple reasons rates different really oh number 5 might protocol protocol loan case given lower rate like aave give cds gearbox dai3 module protocols genuinely happy 3% even brrrr retail happy pay 3% time
338701,abracadabra great example tho things cause broken system cause daniele crook
338702,u expand
338703,danielle crook thats explain months false promises false hopes mismanagement shady stuff multiple projects idk else wanna hear tbh
338705,ty everyone crab market tg best tg
338706,got reading
338707,real takeaway thread dani know disperse
338708,yeah obvious broken system danielle
338709,dm'd
338712,sorry removing praise forks chains sure relevance
338713,hmm maybe understanding properly btc treasury supposed mechanism prevents players taking advantage depeg right aspect treasury lessen chance psychological impact even relative market downturn
338714,i'm starting think ust like kind perpetual convertible bond commercial paper rather pure ponzi still think could qualify definition stablecoin still open system requires external cashflow peg
338715,thats debatable vedao owns significant portion solid emission initially created gain voting control solidly right looking evolution project solidly flaws yeah end would solidly fork yettobeanounced major changes
338717,would fork ghost chain
338718,lets leave discussion thank u nothing discuss really
338719,mean vedao solidly general right
338720,yup tbh sure whats new solidly either
338721,deus teaming 0xdao bribing interesting one watch imo
338722,ust minted luna debt need pay back saying pure ponzi sure comparison bonds commercial papers applies
338723,would thought discussion shortcomingfixes solidly tokenomics great relevance much details maybe better bring back specifics available look
338724,yup feeling ideas may similar perp bonds ust may directly compare companies issue bonds promise yields acquire funds sort like people buy cash inflow luna mint ust yields anchor yield paid lfg burn ust luna sort like redeem equities convertible bonds like happen real world company going well price bond crash ust depegcrash luna going well
338725,buying btc avax may sounds like building reserve i'm question really mechanism ensure liquidationredeem case severe depeg
338726,treasury lessen chance psychological impact that's going work well gmo veggie yam one thing market understands there's backing another market thinks algo stable roundabout collateralized stablecoin
338728,using highly volatile asset purpose stabilising could gone wrong
338729,
338730,rug valhalla ichi
338732,borrow tokens deposited
338733,dont know ser 
338734,interest rate
338735,bad debt
338736,dont risk collateral ichi xichi losing value liquidating everyone
338737,oh yeah see yeah guess compare models like even level current cash inflow luna comes monthly cost 120 million offered subsidized apy anchor guess hard reconcile cash inflow model
338738,anyone found clean way catch custom error try catch statement dont care params passed custom error care thrown solidity
338739,yes indeed current number issued ust current apr anchor can't justify stability stablecoin
338740,guys much block research membership costs
338741,cant find anywhere website
338742,
338743,finally
338744,anyone knows token reputation scored
338746,i'd guess pagerank
338747,heuristics include extremely high supply able transfer unlock date domain names name etc
338748,also matches unicode confusable property whitelist contract names
338749,
338750,package used metamask example helping protect possibly fakemalicious ens names
338751,interesting concept 
338752,i'd imagine uses beyond monkey jpegs
338753,imagine read seen
338754,asking discussion beyond article enemy
338755,sorry ser felt differently bad anyhow guess u say kinda multisig specific assets think u make kind guardian staking contract u stake erc assets security measure think would need testing thinking bet lot people got hacked would live way save assets even though got hacked think staking implemented token
338756,basically multisig
338757,yep kinda
338758,something like eth pos cause slashing
338759,assets locked guardian cannot transferred user still holds ownership assets cannot directly transferred user ownership
338760,lobster daily 376 daily recap 8 april 1 seafood techcrunch future programmable money watch video link link discussion 2 avax instead eth reserves link discussion 3 gearbox protocol update link link discussion 4 wolf wall street defi 20 link link discussion
338761,i'm reading feel idea ok nfts would pain many trxs u erc20 nfts u idle wallet
338762,think work default nfts base requirement nft complies basically allows staking giving sort benefit user long asset control without actually move another contract
338763,frens ever tried use offline smartphone coldwallet i've checked parity seems abandoned coinid vaul also btc app would suggest goal keep vault sometimes sign outgoing txs ethbtc
338764,
338765,
338768,also tails os whonix live usb great solution creating airgapped cold storage classic still works ok keep mind airgapcomputercom
338770,better learning use qubes virtualization
338771,
338772,best get wanna sophisticated stuff
338773,would advise use hardware wallet
338774,hmm set tornadocash like zk based nfts still inplace virtual staking instead guardian transfer nft address backup key
338775,yeah thought revest clone first something bit different similar function fnfts though standardized manner concept decent one however existence smart wallets kinda obviates true staking mechanism use eip1167 deploy smart wallet lock assets smart wallet transfer ownership smart wallet nft
338776,granted want security mechanism avoid bayc getting stolen pretty good option
338777,reminds credit freeze irl
338778,guess really snark there's hiding addresses owned nfts still better guardian address custody nfts
338779,really keep address secured hardware wallet stake dubious ponzis
338780,im still xenforo forums times dat stuff thank awesome tip
338781,yes that's i'd recommend however see angle guy coming
338782,yeah idea makes sense basically non custodial staking tries address problem verify onchain verification onchain whether someone moves assets therefore reliably distribute rewards based basically hook notifies staking contract asset moved
338783,think point guardian contract 721 disable transfers contractlevel mind that's useful person compromising wallet realize valuable seen exact scenario play revest someone lost private keys hacker took everything fnfts containing value rest assets put together know impacted user able wait month return wallet transfer impacted assets hacker moved security obscurity secure method still break hackers figure going
338784,fair still ton people clicking random things even like 15 years
338785,opinion never able fix give people self custody going stupid things way solve taking custody away thats called web2
338786,suppose impression prevented transfers anyways wrap eip1167 asset appear static transfer rights access smart wallet matter exact way rvst work lqdr gets around base curve mechanics one lock per wallet use contractbased smart wallets tied nfts allow staking via proxy custom smartwalletchecker whitelist everything taking liquidity vecrv positions
338787,thank farm42 lafayettetabor qubes good i'd like mobile device try mmk airgap
338788,i'll give time saying solved pain big enough someone play idea solving
338789,unsolvable problem imho person possibility stupid thing stupid thing take possibility away taking part custody rights away
338790,u give option example u first need interact contract
338791,anyone come across good background check provider actual expertise cryptodefi
338792,maybe best solution hiring osinter daily due diligence suggest looking osintfrcom native osint communities sometimes better train right people look people similar fields like 
338793,mean background check
338794,hiring contributors standard criminal bankruptcy judgment stuff ability check crypto sources references
338795,perfect narratives lobsterdao like reputation system lobs nft curation thoughts 
338796,work typically done internal security department mostly expolice exmilitary using osint techniques maybe buy leaked based darknet forums osint adintgeointfacesearch
338797,like get someones cv know check public government bases certain data darkforums get needed data leakages private detectives detect social engineer aiming get hired etc
338798,hope wont sacrificed telling yall true due diligence
338799,interested suggest checking cybdetective ibederoven much cool info topic
338800,awesome thank share
338801,what's best way get exposure eth via stock market ethe something gives u yields staking
338802,canada brazil spot eth etfs burgerland yet
338803,eth inactive staked
338804,buy spy tanks eth price tank
338805,ethe burgerland
338806,get rekt contango maybe better writing representatives voting crypto friendly leaders
338807,i'm citizen us lol much rekt 2% apr 
338808, consider dealing grayscale
338809,quote ethe started trading december 2017 assets management stand 118 billion trust 111% far 2021 comparison ethereum returned 408% words interested investors would likely better investing directly ethereum 
338810,wow sucks thanks info
338811,polygon base fee always 0
338812,hey guys anyone knows ammsliquidity pools run centralized exchanges binance's liquid swap
338813,idex kyc hybrid order book amm model
338814,bitcoin utxobased common approach storing bitcoins secure manner put cold storage means keys stored device connected internet however order retrieve coins one must regularly albeit infrequently interact keys makes vulnerable well introduce recoverable vaults reduce incentive bitcoin private key theft vaults provide two mechanisms increase security first funds stored vault recovered using recovery key case vault key compromised second case recovery key compromised well owner still prevent attacker moving coins worst attacker prevent owner regaining full control funds reduces motivation key theft users permissive storage private keys reducing chances key loss 
338815,gateio amm
338816,albeit quite garbage
338817,major vcs credible auditing team let portfolio companies use paradigm lot researchers auditors seems like itd real differentiator
338818,binance certik
338819,internal auditors would mean vc could become liable case hacks
338820,oh missed credible part
338821,hence use external companies keeping internal engineers 'labs' dept
338822,fair enough ill rephrase question vcs internal security researchers help protocol security totally agree shouldnt publish reports marketing purposes would big conflict
338823,pretty much reputable vc arrington example tough dd standards tech side
338824,hobby mastered wouldnt trust reasonable sums money 
338826,biggest joke weekend thanks ser vcs reputable house auditing firm simply wouldnt able manage paradigm sam others maybe whitehatting daedalus valentin sometimes glancing dialectic dean shitfaced thats gonna match audit
338827,stephangoss
338828,vcs enough sc engineers would spin defi projects
338829,d2d loans loans daos sound interesting especially additional liqudity guilds would nice opportunity borrow money secured treasurylps daoguild reputation
338830,d2d loans sound interesting especially additional liqudity guilds would nice opportunity borrow money secured treasurylps dao reputation
338831,continue jellyf axdvdv
338832,logic trail bits et al would stop audits build defi projects seems vc strong auditing team gets lent projects ideally public audit pass flying colors would valuable differentiator
338833,auditors liable case hacks
338834,drainage top auditing firms across board
338835,cant hire sc dev cofounder position portfolio company let alone make sc engineer tram audit others practical really
338836,letting somebody else part point vc though
338837,yeah convo weird vcs vcs auditors auditors would merge best get intro fast track network
338838,sure really arguing topic lost feels like fugezi convo answer question anybody knows r free suggest add warning answer someone look code going diet 50% cheat days like might first place
338839,yup convo continue fugezi
338840,apologies sir meant internal rd defacto act internal auditing firm
338841,really different things anyway garbage invest often par polkastarter rugs
338842,imagine top tier audit firm took payments seed allocations
338843,could probably yield higher flat fee
338844,actually second thought youre making good point smarter structure would vc firm bulk deal someone like trail bits allow portfolio companies pick auditing time even matter expensive anymore basically impossible even get time vc firm guarantees access would big leg getting cap table
338845,causes huge conflict audit public instead internal use
338853,vc want tangled sort attacks none parties liable
338854,case event people always point fingers least would want internal audit team fault correct
338855,vcs poaching hiring auditors top tier auditing firms establish internal auditing division team matter fact already happening within vc landscape strange would think
338856,i'm gonna name vc tell happening
338857,makes sense one biggest upfront expenses toughest squeeze connections lot new protocols
338858,agree general vcs negative reputation space competition increases crypto native vcs raising shit load capital web2tradfi institutions entering space higher strategic value add required demanded crypto projectsprotocols providing gtm support bd tokenomics introductionsnetwork becoming less strategic day vcs keep boosting value add remain relevant space therefore offering tech support product testing feedback governance support audits crazy may think
338859,
338860,yeah one wants vc audit instead hiring auditors vc firm makes sense establish partnership audit firm
338861,certain
338862,offering help code one thing probably want publicly say audited vc firm audits supposed independent examination conflict interest degree retail already sceptic vcs think would perceived well would create credibility vc firm expertise etc way simpler make partnership auditing firm could even invest
338864,anyone know good video editor available quick turn around
338865,hmm possibly guess perspective matters regards latter part vc could internal auditing team help portcos jump queue trail bits openzeppelin
338867,kinda agree analogy
338868,honestly rotten apples everywhere vcs truly toxic detrimental vc reputation
338869,however different angels
338870,question becomes want raise money retail sure dump moment receive airdrop
338871,auditors allow projects jump queues vcs allocations extra money shady reasons auditors they're criminals posing auditors
338872,ethically agree
338873,going back initial question responding illustrate side story
338874,30k oh 
338875,retail even skeptical audits
338876,
338877,problem death note still getting paid 2995k worth negative reputation worth crypto
338878,looking ux feedback anything appreciated 
338879,hey taking look 1 dark mode 2 max button swap ape mode 12 max also good lp etc 3 maybe colors there's many colors yet 4 looks like work mobile etc expected great job happy give feedback next version

338929,work
338930,samueldare we're building saas based product come handy entreprise teams working together collaboration slither mythx difficult run codebase unless different imports place scan give proper results also find alot false positives dynamic reporting structure provides additional functionalities like mark issue false positivewon't fix fixed issue next iteration report bug status fixed manual audit services well performed well know security researchers focus use research manual audit build signatures auto detection

338932,we'll release user guide end week make easier users go various features product sambacha
338933,tbh false positives really annoying slither always throws open zepplin libraries found mythx less false positive prone slither however let mark threshold issues site nice ux fail see really fixes anything audits wish best
338934,samueldare manual services always going effective kind automated solutions initiative root 5060% vulnerabilities earlier stage development make manual audit process faster effective enterprises leveraging reports plus new projects without funding difficult smaller teams accommodate budget towards full manual audit see typical published report platform details issues found history project ones fixed later iterations

338953,share 2 cents person running tech diligenceadvisory vc pipeline reaching 1012 projects month simply wouldnt feasible keep inhouse auditing team would able cover volume said usually track design product team ongoing basis least identify centralization bottlenecks economic efficiency issues attack vectors etc lot glaring design flaws addressed even team gets actual audit
338954,friend front end web programmer looking get solidity maybe post nice info start learning scratch
338955,
338956,thank much

338961,oh wow thanks randomly thinking protocol working come remember bancor v3 hoping allsided migration sounds like outward bound hosted bancor pools
338962,narrator one click
338963,great post thanks mean etherscan shows dex swaps browser cannot get api im getting results etherscan api would call dex swaps missing
338964,unless added something recently think etherscan api endpoint would give dex records address etherscan display swaps happened inside tx open browser able give request 'give dex trades x address'
338965,try pair erc20 token transfers tx hash see part dex swap something like found reliable way get need
338968,
338970,given event name parameters data know mapping parameters data
338972,take event example know part datas maps values parameter
338973,u need use abi determine types emit
338974,information screenshot cann't figure value data right
338975,etherscan shows contract code abi
338976,actually ask try use duneanalytics logs table distingushi value data table shows raw data field
338977,cann't use abi directly dune support
338978,shows 2 uint256 arrays data
338979,data specific encoding format dune request contract abi added data decoded
338980,yeah already submit contract address decoding curious whether find patterns data
338981,challenge may they're arrays rather types
338982,output includes array lengths
338983,also stored data
338984,many libraries use decode look web3 docs
338985,link event youre looking
338986,
338987,transferbatch event
338988,thanks limitation try use tooldune specific tablelogs distinguish values
338989,oh interesting looking extract two last parameters arrays
338990,yeah way array length fixed 4
338991,
338993,turns 2
338994,also sure whether two arrays lengthif still extract
338995,
338996,bytecode array always start length array
338997,right params indexed applies parameters without indexed attribute abiencoded data part log youll need x k elements k assumed type uint256 encx enck encx0 xk1 first value length array k k fixedlength pieces containing values array
338998,cactushoes freeatnet got appreciate help
338999,dune decoded values need decode resources dune postgres database afaik
339000,might wrong decode exactly actually always takes bit messing beware paddings also note x lenencx multiple 32

339009,byte offsets
339010,sorry yes correct

339054,either would need bot swap limit slip
339055,seriousness set high slippage get tax argument ui tells upfront price impact whats point overly generous

339128,later options oiler believe also diver well see quite shall available choose
339129,ok think see youre saying etherscans api endpoints arent great fit say writing debank split returned data type distinct endpoints endpoints dont quite compose ie get txes given address via txlist one txes swap see outgoing request want know much usdc returned swap fetch event logs via getlogs queryable block range tx hash need machinery youd guess im stuck writing languages supported libraries available none especially tolerable anything larger bash script
339130,lyra options amm
339131,already thanks 
339132,yea i'm getting confused dw head split sell single contract lp without choice

339137,good deri panama based regulated fca nfa tho
339138,parity smart contract wallet users ever compensated devops199 2017 exploit regarding polkadot turned huge financial success compensation plan would make sense imo anyone opinions matter
339139,pinging muditg since recently tweeted ser
339140,compensation
339141,parity behind polkadot right
339142,right
339143,compensation afaik there's liable party compensating
339144,also suffered hack public sale msig also hacked
339145,300000 eth 1b public sales stucked forever
339146,remember whether big drama back ordinary users back people losing life savings todays defi hacks people cautious back since degen culture thing yet
339147,think reaction reaction hacks days maybe slightly worse
339148,really remember big movement ask compensation
339149,multisigs suffered hack means power users suffered mostly project's multisigs held salaries treasury degens culture icos culture icos risk compare 4% apr lending power users knew risk
339150,afaik parity lost ico participants got dot mistaken edit oops thinking polkadot devops199 parity 
339151,think one section demanded hard fork overall people investing parity less aware risks
339152,witness events say everyone understood risks
339153,polkadot developed parity think might confusing two different incidents parity multisig suffered malicious hack multisig often fades comparison devops199 perhaps nearly memeable accidentally killed
339154,hey lobsters arrive amsterdam next week happy visitmeet person nice events events planning go

339752,guys farming atm stables eth
339754,rl job ftm stuff
339756,revival omnichain interesting think worth seeing goes
339757,restrictions lido max size staking maybe trivial spin validators 50k eth
339758,lido deploys eth time due staking queue works anyway eth queue still earn staking rewards
339759,unless steth trades discount always better depositing lido directly
339760,rokectpool can't trick need extra available validators first
339761,till seems total scam raised millions selling nfts totally useless since still cant borrow
339762,currently looking uniswap v3 liquidity stuff anyone know logic different contracts thrown within tx show considerable differences amount1 would understand regular one happen often 3
339763,yea failed boost cold start paid nft collateral initially treat value base gratully move general collateral value consensus borrow pool provide enough liquidity nft lending
339764,anyone know investor discord mods dont seem know anything regarding roadmap
339765,probably whale arbitraging anchor's incentives
339768,wen elon
339769,
339770,
339771,kind measures impact can't people transfer assets non blacklisted address use anyway long blacklists recursivetreelike updated absolute realtime possible make difference
339772,wen fork soon
339773,forkworthy also forking something like tornado hurts privacy original forks users model depends many deposits different entities possible
339774,lf contract immutable anymore way blacklist hacks etc
339775,yes there's problem model changes good deposits
339776,seemingly small give inch take mile what's next relayers start running script verifies good sufficiently kyc'd somewhere maybe relayers taken already la tor hyperbole maybe
339777,would form whitelisting basically render whole point tornado obsolete
339778,disgusting absolutely terrible standard set
339779,generally agree imho much organizational structure behind tornado already makes vulnerable kind stuff best deployed anonymously immutable
339780,gotten rid inperson leverage ahead
339781,think tornado stay regulator complaint though otherwise addresses interacted tornado would banned cexes thus leaving almost easy way stay anonymous still ability cash money internet cash
339782,definition regulator compliant thing regulators handle obfuscation funds
339783,thats move kind odd anything everyone involved aware without canceling whole thing
339784,provide services regulator compliant though 
339785,window dressing
339786,aaaaaand case point people unironically okay
339787,yeah thats good long regulators okay way tornado currently one use freely
339788,people unironically okay stuff users tornado makes sense
339789,surprised
339790,people send tokens exchanges darknets
339791,well use dont need
339792,yes that's exactly ronin bridge exploiters right blacklisted address transfer eth addresses use tornado
339793,yeh least long ago wh something like 2030% tx coming directly coinbase 
339794,mean best way solve problem actually rebuild regulations makes sense provide proof funds whoever asks put jail wont lets leave discussions
339795,supporters privacy censorship resistant platforms imho
339796,best way solve problem make irrelevant
339797,assuming structures charge regulation acting good faith
339798,actually dont see way avoid regulations currently
339799,kowtowing weird frankenstein monster
339800,funnily sanctions oracle operated eoa i'd think twice relying 
339801,clear rebuilding regulations way tolerates products like tornado whole goal get control people recall meaningful reversal regulations opposite direction lets reopen conversation tends become spammy
339802,easy integrate narcware products backdoors abused
339803,easy order able maintainers need protected otherwise go doubt tornado people aligns vision product
339804,maintainer basically absolutely anonymous extent law enforcement track thats tricky days gets tricky every day
339805,unfortunately need fight protect maintainers eg 
339806,protection absolutely anonymous software immutable decentralized possible running sort central twitter account already problematic imho tricky topic basically communication online matter small open window identified
339807,keep mentioning liquity
339808,things depend single maintainer could part solution work also set way allowing churn protect people leaving things become heated everyone different perception risks nothing preventing ideas proliferating
339809,may practical every project one way there's nothing strongarm compliance everything else less solves
339810,also oracle pretty much useless pretty sure chainalysis knows what's idea v2 script relayers track transfers
339811,probably tell regulatory boomers look comply holy sanction list really silly think shows point someone really get stuff works
339812,ok growing weed
339813,code freedom speech rule big 
339814,good speech determined current fads

339955,missing samurai's katana
339957,well least works
339958,cowswap price action
339960,nice that's like definition composability crypto
339961,every avalanche subnet validator must validate main chains scaling coming
339962,scaling comes small amount validators specific subnet performance pretty high subnets centralised
339963,subnet validators must also validate avax chain avax validators validate given subnet
339964,validators it'll interesting see outcome
339965,can't find anything uh validator stakes main chain affected activity subnet would random subnet t1000 validators colluding insert whatever penalized main chain
339966,malicious subnet validators arent currently penalized main net
339968,wow dumb trade mint steth 1 1
339969,likes curve much want swap way anyway
339971,hey i'm complaining get buy crv ucrv
339972,steth pool popular seeing several 10 mil trades breddy goot
339973,like curve wont swap slippage worse thats ngmi strategy
339974,size already gmi generations
339976,bcb 
339977,add cross river bank metropolitan bank well usa
339978,hey everyone we've vulnerability disclosure funds risk full rundown 
339979,bcb take months months screw around hire people trad banks really get crypto accounts guy ex military idea startups rejected 100m hedge fund client emailed gmail fund managing partners personal gmail
339980,anybody familiar auditors
339981,nope sounds like brand new
339982,know much subnets avalanche say cosmos shared security model sounds superior securitydecentralization aspect interesting launches
339983,could subnet's validator set collude produce invalide state
339984,dedaub found multichain exploit code4rena really auditor read description screenshot
339985,
339986,old post response gavin woods criticism subnet security model according thread subnets subset larger universe validators subnet's security independent larger network would think yes answer question trouble finding information avalanche docs go security implications risks
339987,finding one exploit say much company auditors consistency researcher found exploit guy working day day audits good hunter always good chef
339988,right though case one exploit significant really crypto's significant case though much new without marketing clout
339989,guess definitively answers docs recommend 5 validators subnet going 10 methinks going end well
339990,dedaub however great reputation
339991,get work ethereum foundation
339992,
339993,also publish academic white papers
339994,imho says list audits tbh
339995,seen three sigma labs work good well niche
339996,ethereum foundation renamed fiat foundation sell much eth fiat surely pay bills eth least promoting kind adoption one legal goals
339997,contractlibrarycom
339998,pretty sure winding operations eventually one goals
339999,dunno 99% world wants dollars eth
340000,yeah ethereum foundation 99% world
340001,expenses assume
340002,shit sherlock
340003,thanks genius take
340004,hold eth centralized
340005,thanks wait someone actually knows talking
340006,dumb take selling fiat 2018 saved
340007,et herium otherwise
340008,sell amount need expenses arise know much fiat bought last year
340009,generally time top perfectly use advantage
340010,time literally move market
340011,they've sold 55000 eth fiat
340012,last 12 months
340013,there's nothing costs much
340014,signals lack faith using eth payment option
340015,fact crypto payments available almost every good service that's necessary ngo
340016, nonprofit
340017,hypothetical someone set real ethereum foundation took fiat btc donations used buy eth refused use service providers accept eth thus buying using eth millions dollars worth ecosystem payments inside outside crypto world would foundation benefit ethereum ethereum foundation aka professional fiat acquirers
340018,kinda obvious needs volatile asset mean payment
340019,liquidate anything want upon receipt
340020,assets currencies volatility
340021,comment comes across never paid anything crypto
340022,bird hand worth two bush
340023,one eth worth two eth later
340024,today eth 3000 tomorrow 70 ez
340025,fiat maxi
340026,ngmi
340027,ser
340028,called nonprofit meant make profit
340029,u sell less eth moar dollars moar good things u less eth
340030,also realize buy sell things services eth
340031,think kinda smart move sell high
340032,someone impersonate moonbirds twitter account website actually transfers nft address
340033,need fiat
340034,
340037,nft chat group
340038,tell guys fixed prices eth twas 1400 dropped 70 totally rekt
340039,sry mate salary dropped 20 times
340040,cann't talk anything nft even thought lobsters may scammed
340041,tell vic complete noob welcome cryptocurrenies fully designed payment system good luck bags hope hard work people put making ecosystem grow helps bags somewhat
340042,group hearing words react love
340043,that's misconception though name help point though said probably end adoption convenience wins
340044,great real purchasing power whatever usd gathered last year fallen 9%40% depending inflation index use
340045,dont worry bout bags ser
340046,realize stopped participating public groups
340047,40% still better 20 times drop year
340048,u forgot 2018 okay np ser
340049,muh ecosystem muh payments
340050,telegram account made less year ago
340052,find strange ethereum foundation would dump eth needed reduce risk treasury could always hedged using derivatives probably would better move made sense
340053,
340054,trading derivs option due legal consequences might cause
340055,foundation individual shitcoin slinger
340056,give grants eth
340057,yeah doubt stuff weird like transferring 9 figures stack straight exchange think really simple sending message 
340058,every single time send exchange signaled top several days yeah clear message newcomers 
340059,maybe self fulfilling prophecy market believes eth foundation selling top
340060,sure using options futures hedge risk introduce legal complications simply selling spot market would common practice sorts organizations source assumption fact liken using derivatives shitcoin slinging makes think latter
340061,even eth foundation want eth can't find use reasoning
340062,well many jurisdictions trading derivs requires special license assumption common practice software development organization
340063,assumption eth foundation jurisdiction perhaps yes actually important people fit narrative whatever want see viable looking secret meaning eth foundation dumps coins like still looking satoshi really
340064,one kind large software development company uses derivatives hedge example i'll leave discussion clearly clue talking 
340065,fair
340066,still requires special license
340067,need special licence trade derivatives organisation least usa
340068,first think would fairer set schedule eth foundation built fiat reserve regardless price action instead selling sporadically second think eth foundation always regarded authoritative figure ethereum ecosystem forever
340069,broker easily allow easy buying regular equity though want something quite sophisticated may need counterpart take side buts never question licensing
340070,
340073,wow scammers scored two moonbirds azuki get tagged daily seem large stock verified accounts address accumulates eth make liquidating stolen jpegs 
340075, defi treasury principles apply
340076,selling think eth high seems like good treasury management
340077,hedge fund charity whose entire purpose promote eth
340078,thing get eth widespread adoption resources pay good devs people
340079,insisting paying every vendor employee forth eth even size eth foundation impact probably ultimately negligible
340080,emergency sell small amount need arises
340081,
340082,principle applies ef eth
340083,hundred million dollars
340084,mean consistently selling near top thats really good money management imo
340085,want much runway possible eth development finished
340089,hey wondering usually go trade tokens otc private groups airswap still smth 
340090,grapefruit

340104,stablecoin thing decently popular like week ago
340105,survived like forever
340106,honestly respect team keeping long
340107,guy tweet explained bean uses stablecoin governance flash loan borrow enough control governance pass commit malicious contract rug
340110,wait actually donated ukraine
340112,even buy dip control gov price never recover
340113,bean thing even sophisticated
340114,point protocols flash loaned gov proposal passed drained
340115,didnt even know protocols allowed instantaneous onchain proposals pass even delay something
340116,excellent horrifying question
340117,yeah even get approved without thought
340118,seems like poor mechanism
340119,since i've made proposals thought wider window minimum
340120,
340121,yep

340133,sad
340134,btw bean dao contracts audited 
340135,wtf omniscia though
340136,post audit conclusion codebase beanstalk team considered high standard outstanding issues remain within codebase
340137,
340138,amazing audit dao contracts flag could acquire enough voting power propose vote execute one txn usually propose using power gained prior block there's proposal delay there's voting period finally timelock actually execute
340139,researching yesterday parking 6fig yield farm god bless lobsters chat searched bean many people warned stay away dodged bullet
340140,allegedly old harmony wallet getting hacked idea true also longer supported would uninstall still asap
340143,yeah lots recommendations ct bean great place park funds

340193,people investing bean reminds guy biz invested bingus token cant help laugh thats exploit
340194,kept going probably would happened lol
340195,wait next algostable hype farm capital shift
340196,yeah nothing exploit many reasons fail actually surprised guys like jack niewold posting bullish stuff beans thought really irresponsible getting exploited shortcut final model algo stable stable 0
340197,meh rather people experiment proper algo stable 500 iterations fiatcoins fiatcoin wrappers
340199,fund sol new wallet anon even use portal bridge
340200, foreword would like state code exploited attack audited omniscia introduced beyond initial audits system 
340201,exact code audit
340202,final contributing factor governance module contains emergencycommit function allows caller circumvent usual lifecycle proposal immediately execute supermajority voting power function highlighted right audit
340203,check code yet traveling see bunch commits postaudit seemed touch core features i'm unfamiliar protocol
340205,anyone know tools analyze lp positions kinda like seedlefinance revertfinance one supports chains specifically pancakeswap
340206,maybe good toolsresources github repo
340207,checked daily ape didnt find anything

340341,probably ac mind personal trust could actually strong element decentralization amount people personally trust naturally limited makes theoretically stronger anchor economic incentives securing blockchain would set group trusted people exchange could define regulation truly independent called local economic trading system lets hundreds attempts spanning back many decades aim selfsufficiency comes cost economic efficiency global markets updating model web3 would mean groups would aim selfsufficiency could multiple groups limited set goods traded within group trust strong reduced moving group trade global trade work parallel system overlapping lets groups would enable people pick degree decentralization type regulation want
340342,trustlines sort stuff
340343,encointer

340345,trustlinesapp lets establish debt connections trustlines establish connections lines etc added favor currency back open channel 1 favor means owe one owe one open another channel 11 someone else 2 favors give also owe two one direction technically ask favor connection
340346,one common good chain polkadot relies inperson meetings proof personhood schemes kinda doa good see experimentation kind like live idena
340347,sounds close mind traditional lets balance 0 group members start buying puts minus commitment sell something group member prices freely negotiated trade voluntary scaling needs rooting personal trust keep system decentralized groups independent otherwise return global economy others bigger say deciding rules economic interactions

340510,purely immutable contracts would kill 95% defi would include almost lending protocols extension protocols depend base layer perhaps people would fine really people want extremely rigid capital inefficient financial system suspect dont shouts void artem runs fingers ears
340511,isnt suboptimal dump whole fpis stack one transaction 
340513,agree really great apps matured hardly one example like quote disperseapp works nicely without token
340514,gnosis safe worked well without token people get paid
340515,small markup would better strategy token launches suck money retail insidersdevs model like charge 011 ethyear create gnosis safe might nice top premium support etc 
340516,governance tokens way get around regulation teams real decisions made governance mostly anyways
340517,sure theres anything noteworthy tbh another ct shillerinfluencer discovered blatant pnder
340518,anyone know nonevm chain integration metamask
340519,hi lobsters would like share new article article discussing competitive advantage governance tokens feel free reach dm comments interested also implement new vision stable coin project 
340520,chain support evm spec integrated meatamask rarely possible requires creation additional middle layer
340521,dont think metamask plans makes sense use try port existing metamask codebase use non evm chains check clover wallet good non evm option enjoy multi plex connections means easily naviagte chains different tabs without reset network manually
340522,liquality also multi chain wallets atomic transactions

340544,vision modular snaps never took isnt comes metamask would find implement many helper libraries might well rebuild also metamask tightly coupled evm works remember things like block tracker nonce tracker head

340700,mean wormhole celer nomad anyswapmultichain working interchain messaging bit even chainlink announced ccip last year altho sure right layerzerostargate team deserve huge credit success recognition narrative tech exactly new happy corrected curious perception opinions
340701,cosmos also ibc working
340702,
340703,better ones
340704,hes shitposter
340705,watching get repeatedly ratioed wormhole team statisfying
340708,forget multichain anycall tech different protocols uses different approach especially terms architecture us believes approach best multichain believe smpc nodes network best approach end maybe fully correct answer dont think infighting solution
340709, forgot mentioning anyswapmultichain
340710,router protocol
340711,think
340712,think challenge category lack understanding around even things basic constitues bridge mean liquidity network mintandburn token bridge generalized message passing channel cosmos ibcs credit project focused building underlying data channels since early token transfers one specification sending packets zones however given massive need noncosmos chains yesterday seeing proliferation high quality teams building infra evm environments standards language fragmented makes hard nontechnical user understand whats going hood allows playing loose fast positioning
340713,ahaha saying make mention protocols saying simple
340714,indeed pranaymohan rightly pointed standards different approaches significant tradeoffs hard evaluate retailnontechnical users easily swayed narrative positioning
340715,soon new crosschain message aggregator emerge heavy lifting devs select bridge use sending messages beleive ibc standard become base standard implemented layerzero others also implement socket already great job aggregating liquidity bridge soon might also data bridging
340717,ooh yeah movr networksocket tech working really cool several big brain folks really ultra passionate different approaches speaking aggeregators li fi aggregates 'em btw knowledge primarily asset transfer soon data transfer tooo there's across protocol one awesome lane
340719,
340721,fud really possible
340722,aggregators taking positive slippage long know feature doubt tho user quoted 35k ui
340723,read comments likely 50% slippage
340724,ibc protocol seem like best tool job trivial implement outside cosmos based chains however multiple parties working implementations light clients 
340725,xcm pretty great advantages ibc allows incentivised message passing also ensures message executed correctly via spree think xcm dark horse race one seems talking
340726, another thread look
340727,
340728,llama stonk
340729,beauty decentralized systems anyone make improvement proposals considered community use cases evolve see new token standards created characteristics solve larger ecosystem ultimate list token standards evm nonevm chains 
340731,doesnt matter slippage used still stealing lol
340732,slippage couple days back fell broke hip i'm calcium tablets
340733,data onchain click decode input data see minreturnamount 18138 minreturnamount amount user quoted slippage user specified unless user trading 50% slippage settings 1inch fact quoted 18k yeti keeping everything quoted amount standard 1inch monetize service like check paraswap believe used take 50% positive slippage sure current approach firebird collect positive slippage rather takes 005% service fee swap
340734,positive slippage big part aggregators earn revenue pretty sure paraswap 0x think sure
340735,pretty bad model
340736,ton ways trade go bad user introduced another one
340737,could use low slippage
340738,51%
340739,get hyped launch low slippage
340740,would use 1inch get hyped launch
340741,interact router directly etherscan example
340742,also allows put slippage want
340743,well personally everyone knows ways
340744,million dollar question
340745,happen slippage though
340746,since price lower tokens returned 1inch gives user min amount still less value
340747,get price quoted 05% 1% problem use 1inch look aggregators fund way whilst still honouring price quote seen new launches advising buyers use aggregator service search back november last year discussed maybe earlier
340748,thats point using aggregators usually launch one platform right pay extra gass
340749,say freeloading
340750,sers know good agencys nft marketing preferrable one one arts pfp's
340751,hey guys anyone assist ticket maker event today
340752,good note thank
340753,
340754,change zero nonzero balance technically that's happened never knew possible design
340755,nonstandard token sure

340757,coded
340758,macha 1inch decentralized services would considered centralized given individual companies operating api offchain aggregation
340759,lobster daily 387 daily recap 19 april 1 lobsters amsterdam link discussion youre amsterdam hop chat hear 2 crypto regulation vs regulated crypto read link discussion like discussion 3 vitalik onchain governance without minimum voting periods snapshots link link discussion 4 anyone know nonevm chain integration metamask link discussion 5 possible receive erc20 tokens without transaction log receipt link link discussion
340761,definitely centralized can't relly use contracts without using api
340762,noncustodial
340763,apart restricting access iran sanctioned countries centralized apirpc operators known licensing obligations rules follow
340764,well create rules wish point centralized systems
340765,legal chat follow relevant restrictions users
340766,

340769,wow
340770,news relevant ser
340771,brb sybillin
340772,lol nice find sybililin' protocols details airdrop structure
340773,trouble understanding synthetix staking snx staked minting susd snx still tradable can't people sell staked snx understanding wrongly
340774,collateralize susd minting snx locks snx repayburn susd unstake snx goes value unstake though long maintain 400% collateralisation ratio
340775,hmm what's preventing people selling snx mechanism prevents happening since staking traditional sense
340776,snx locked repay burning susd can't sell
340777,injective
340778,whatever happened remember rage back day
340779,still building think interesting launches likely coming soon 
340780,fourth year testnet
340781,shots fired
340783,instuction unclear mean fork canon solidly protocols solidex maintaining solidly 
340784,would first get official hard fork ad hock team think
340785,contracts immutable solidex maintaining ui solidly can't fix bugs
340786,oops pasta lol
340787,tweet reads redeploying contract copying states new version
340788,people would migrate liquidity new pools yes sounds like kind snapshot new token
340789,
340790,wonder decides canon protocol situation interesting see rolled
340791,usersliquidity thing matters end
340792,effectively launching solidity fork 11 airdrop existing solid holders unlocked vetokens thing canon imo etc canon
340793,judging chain activity believe eth canon etc kind asymetric bet hardcore ethos
340794,ye situation would similar eth etc users prefer fixed protocols vs others stick original
340795,canon ultimately decided culturally right
340796,'layer zero' consensus people feel like eth canon etc uniswap definitely canon sushi best guess people see existing solidly noncanon creator longer working got bugs open source almost seems fair game beneficial reboot
340797,uni sushi different tho team active og vs fork story rather canon orphan story
340798,said i'm rebootteam well
340799,ultimately similar thought process guess one real one one fakecopyforknoncanon
340800,
340801,seems like element kicked airdrop szn rd 2
340802,that's pretty cool
340803,awesome access come inside currntly first room left come come meet front
340804,xpollinate bridge right
340805,yes
340806,awesome must ran many wallets thing back like four chains
340807,hey everyone suggestion antidetect use multiple coinlist accounts
340808,one probably announcing
340809,taboo topic
340810,well much point door everyone already keys
340811,hi guys given recent development fudshill opinion ldo value first article take easy 
340812,thumbnail says much lido actually worth instead true valuation lido much lido actually worth stuck thought id share initial thoughts ser trying anal 
340813,done
340815,nice one ser
340816,update tokenomic vemodel 
340817,would seem case let's wait see use dao treasury evolve
340818,pls
340819,would honestly projects try wacky new token models rather everybody going 'eh venomics alright lets try
340820,works alright curve mean it'll work would rather see experimentation tbh
340821,i'd say works project need governance yeah experimentation token models absolutely necessary
340822,
340823,
340824,guess hard projects commit 'try something new' could tank bags bigly wacky tokenomics ideas public good whole space
340825,think even best thing liquid staking protocol
340826,lurking ages big brains mean might way rug pulls soft rugs hacks 
340827,well liquidity one theres also solid argument fees 
340828,yeah liquidity dex volume would 10x cexes
340830,underlying blockchain scale 10x binance's throughput
340831,good question actually
340832,hopefully one day
340853,anyone examples lido staking integration directly contract looking function swaps eth steth contract audited well would great 
340872,assigned mutes bans machine style native shill pls thank
340874,meant version people use one we'll care end
340880,im still curious someone outsider perspective v3 meantime beta gone live
340882,information stake distribution validator set
340884,
340885,original source 
340886,binance usual 
340889,thats good birthday present
340890, seems inner battle
340891,know crazy 
340892,us treasury sanctions russian crypto miners first sanction mining 
340894,also happy birthday guy killed hitler
340895, ivangbi funny true rihanna gearbox dao 100k gear tokens course think true would fun true
340898, wouldnt simple fix makes oracle attacks fuse pools financially infeasible choose appropriate gamma pool dont think would classify guard rail since borrowing power follows organic price increase time scale snapshot distance could probably chosen aggressively something like couple hours even shorter thoughts technical reason prevents design
340899,gm lobsters name giancarlo sanchez im software engineer working new web3 project dappify nocode platform launching dapps templates nft marketplaces event bookings qr code payments every dapp tokenized nft i'm looking creative people want custom branded nft marketplace first template perhaps know code budget build free democratize building experience web3
340900,who's paying make checkpoints
340901,hm choose 24h checkpoints maybe simply pool operator manageable think
340902,expensive roughly write 24h twap chain
340903,24h sounds like lifetime considering volatility things might make sense stablefiatcoins much everything else cost vpepo posted stuff like
340904,really interesting idea
340905,also relevant considering infrequently oracle updated 
340906,hey everyone guys know could find info regarding protocols exploits correlation audits found info saying 2122% protocols exploited unaudited mean much know global percentage unaudited protocols range studied like maybe top 1000 projects something like goes info available rekt
340907,34 eth initialize regarding reading around 200k gas per call
340908,proposing somewhat similar done keep3r btw uses 5 day twap
340910,correction reading 25k gas per observe initialization 
340911, sources
340912,make trigger borrows 24h period went one borrows gets updated whenever
340913,curious vulnerable someone manipulating price beforehand borrowing
340914,thanks yeah that's i've looking i'm wondering stats top 5001000 protocols know many actually audited want see audits actually helps refrain exploiters way i'm 100% convinced
340915,whenever borrow update collateral liquidated block rather next one
340916,manipulation can't happen within block like manipulation borrow
340917,hmm
340918,iirc quote updates start new block
340919,would manipulate easily arbitragable sufficient market
340920,liquidated borrow would rather limited due 24h twap 20% threshold
340921,note oracle updated every block calling observe secondsago value 0 return recently written observation recent beginning current block older 
340922,guys see shit lol
340923,univ3 oracle used fuse verified 
340924,guess source code 
340925,one find really good like top teir web designers crypto project dribbble seems like meh dono spent days behance find something good
340926,wait updating every x duration checkpoints work
340927,checkpoint reference actual twap used
340928,every 24 hs update 24h twap order reference 15 minute twap goes 20% reference refuse update maintain old value
340929,ah see reply
340930,slight tangent would done anything inverse exploit
340931,yeah
340932,would render exploit almost nonprofitable
340933,ah wait
340934,used keep3rv2 oracle uniswapv2 contracts works differently
340935,comments related univ3 oracles work
340936,oh work v2
340937,oracle inv using
340938,could make work tho
340939,wrong assume it'll require frequent onchain updates achieve thing
340940,would gascostly frequency
340941,need write storage bad need reread guard value every operation guess
340942,yeah
340943,also need store timestanp guard could perhaps lose precision price pack together since need reading time
340944,sure tech implementation specifics sadly people mean opinionated oracle v3 i'm wrong topic 
340945,
340946,propose deprecate xsushi relocate revenue towards sushidao funds sushi achieve financial health able grow team create sushi ecosystem fund overall enough money scale business
340947,also check defiyield rekt database 
340948,reminder today last day gyroscope testnet game 
340949,arbitrage opportunity 
340950,borrowing power say 10k coin x deposited collateral borrowing 9k theres bullish news coin x rallies 100% would big problem wait 24 hours borrow additional 9k twice valuable collateral
340951,thinking liquidations due genuine price drops 30% like hardly unprecedented
340952,nbanft nation3 crazy 
340953,checkpoint idea meant protect protocol standard attack 1 deposit collateral 2 manipulate oracle increase borrowing power drastically 3 borrow much assets pool effects liquidations might issue possible let smart contract use different value decide eligibility liquidations value takes decide borrowing power must 2 things fundamentally linked together
340954,however dont see whats problem price goes could elaborate worried liquidations would occur since checkpoints lagging notice proposal uses minimum function mincollateralpricegammalastcheckpointprice price drops everything simply works though checkpoints dont exist checkpoints effect price increases
340955,smart contracts power nft marketplace
340956,fugaaaaziiiiiiii
340959,yes that's checkpointing works differently mind
340962,
340963,anyone intel caw koo cluk situation
340964,
340965,dont know wtf means asked go
340966,hi owen dapp nft orchestrates one multiple smart contracts per template dapp using builders tokenized dapp nft ownership across smart contracts within app smart contracts source share builders creation process aware logiccan someone validate
340967,advertising allowed group
340968,ask
340969,deployed mainnet docs would def interested peeping they're available
340970,yet plan launching second week may still ironing things id love invite discord answer questions 
340971,sers question coinbase wallet something weird going signing message kovan mainnet message basically kovan works fine mainnet signing process sign either uses method fugezi happens alert window adds something extra ruins requiring coinbase whitelist
340973,function using sign recall right several deprecated ones different security concerns maybe ignored testing prod throws warning edit nvm metamask could still related choose different sign functions maybe dont require wl
340976,
340977,maybe helps general issue seems signing functions generic could used trick user signing transaction instead message eip712 lastest attempt solving
340978,eip712 work properly hardware wallets unfortunately
340979,great guess would split implementation cb wallet others actually issue
340980,hey devs tested building anything polygon rollups hermez guess starknet want share experience trying figure likely win race integrate stuff earlier
340981,probably issue related ethers 544 seems fixed update 564
340982,protocols yfi forks mainnet
340983,there's yfii aka dfi money sure looking coingecko surprisingly well
340984,right thought dead
340985,bit established
340986,harvestgro
340987,yfi fork though coingecko nice research feature check 
340988,anyone data self hosted wallets hot marketshares
340990,uhm gro leveraging yearn's code back days though idk evolved since
340992,
340993,create2 otherwise that's stupid 
340994,seems like
340995,alameda's bags disbelief
340996,
340997,uhhhh yes
340999,masterchef seen better days ser
341000,
341001,told since snx enabled staking finally going masses
341002,somehow time word staking repurposed redefined instead receiving rewards contributing chain security collateral stake modern staking seems mean idk give coins reward dont sell current coins lol
341006,start harvest stakedao gro
341007,
341011,can't wait stablecoin backed stable coins
341012,enough watch one project blow must watch collapse entire chains
341013,crypto needs 
341014,ya coming
341015,already 2018
341016,there's even stalecoins related datasets days think next step makerdao jpegs
341018,definitely paid make ust seem stable safe relatively
341019,
341020,ponzis forked ampl coin rebases price milk added three whole eth liquidity collapses maybe five figures lost ponzis new stable coin backed much crypto asset reserve currencyyield bearing instrument believe us look questionable math flowery language understand collapses brings entire chains
341021,
341022,1inch always done fud reemerges twitter probably twice year get called theres always users learn first time though since 1inch wont publish
341023,could somebody tell could see decentralized stable coin supply centralized stable coin supply ratio 
341026,anyone know developer channel group want smart contract development preference survey developers
341027,thanks guys
341028,
341029,omg amazing
341030,thanks man
341031,hey guys staking contract selling tokens sending mev address loosing eth tokens
341032,
341033,someone help checking what's mev bot sending selling tokens
341035,think web interface might exploited somehow
341037,anyone got full pdf 
341038,thanks
341040,pinky promise wont take private keys
341041,trust
341042,hero 
341043,ser pls read docs direct vote 1inch network's 'instant' governance system swap surplus amounts distributed 1inch network treasury user referral rewards
341044,missed whole conversation yesterday strongly agree statement terminology well defined almost impossibe avg application differentiate
341045,ive read docs clear users keep surplus get twitter mobs calling whenever gets noticed large amount
341046,wasnt saying wasnt clear ser
341047,something thats widely advertised known users
341048,binance
341049,binance probably still celebrating 420 lol
341050,works fine
341051,oh 403 refuses authorize
341052,primordialaa exactly example dunking wrapped assets doesnt help clear risk representational assets escrow underlying omnichain tokens supply peg one chain risk underlying trustroot compromised supply peg broken
341053,see fundamental technical obstacles implementing something like ser dont visibility twitter hard get feedback 
341054,anything across two chains risk underlying transport protocol compromised nature messaging work improving validation mechanisms interesting
341055,important point
341056,agreed whats solution wrapped assets ive seen team criticize solution generating representational liquidity stargate capitalizes liquidity pools point im making selective use terminology make positioning marketing case ignores still risk since agree early industry need help educate vocabulary launder 
341057,issue wrapped assets clearly carries risk post transaction ie tx x b risk transaction also entire duration b exists 20b outflow insert total wrapped flow chain chain b 20b standing risk forever unwrapped meaning transport like corrupted tx point tx risk end user always carries exposure something like stargate pay higher premium latent liquidity completely removes standing risk ie 20b outflow chain chain b done without user ever exposed risk outside risk immediate tx without overall system risk ever exceeding amount currently stargate pools
341058,youre 100% correct escrow risk persists indefinitely post settlement layer transfer two questions 1 get exposure assets like eth supply peg mainnet need representational asset capitalize pools liquidity network like stargate right unless ever expecting fully native deployments like usdc permissionless tokens dont offer 2 youre flagging application risk smart contract performs escrow function bulletproof apprehension go away
341059,answer omnichain token native deployments everywhere rebalance liquidity using l0 trust root risk 
341060,thanks answering qs btw
341061,2 basically taken care light client bridge model
341062,1 youll never get native gas assets chain without wrapping thats extremely clear think interesting question wantneed ill save another day 2 consensus layer fails standing risk still exposed smart contract risk persists method period nobody solves writing good code problem standing 20b risk example validationconsensus layer fails corrupted forges tx
341063,well yes
341064,would say yes obviously disagree
341065,2 yeah true omnichain assets well trustroot compromised tokens get inflated 
341066,going say ethereum avalanche still need need somebody pass next block right still exposure people malicious verified
341067,course like said transport layers carry risk
341068,question shapesurface
341069,cant criticize wrapped assets
341070,apples apples criticism
341071,mean wrapped assets carries standing risk stargate carries static risk
341072,fairly clear
341073,jackzampolin clear weve straightforward forever think light client model best current model impractical current systems gas chains reduced factor 100010000 would absolutely implement validation library default everything
341074,agree doesnt completely get rid 2
341075,see would disagree w impractical current systems
341076,still carries risk building fraudulent chain prior state
341077,know would haha
341078,disagree 
341079,i'm building bunch light client implemenations
341080,good
341081,looking forward 
341082,trust chains transacting
341083,mean terminology confusion ser arguing application specific risk vs risk trust root youre arguing trust root fails escrowed assets rugged true affects tokens need maintain supply peg whether wrapping transport layer mint burn
341084,people passing headers header chains
341085,ethereum writing headers avalanche
341086,group nodes individuals
341087,verify headers need trust relayers
341088,vector
341089,trusted relayers vector
341090,could
341091,current state p
341092,yes hypothetically could
341093,bls precompiles bad
341094,anyway gotta run yall fun 
341095,eth light client run cosmos side
341096, cya pranaymohan
341097,ethereum side
341098,l8r pranaymohan
341099,cosmos light client
341100,writes state data
341101,gas expensive till get optmizations like precompiles
341102,relayers
341103,chain clients ensure state transitions valid
341104,world relayers malicious write false header forged chain
341105,ie prior chain 1 forged block next block
341106,would invalid state transition
341107,current light client security model
341108,contract cosmos side verify validity next block 100% certainty vice versa ethereum
341109,previous validator set verify validator set change trust threshold state transitions
341110,validator set malicious
341111,also anyways thats consensus specific clearly
341112,trust chains transacting
341113,yes validator set ethereum isnt necessarily interested security cosmos vice versa
341114,incentives totally different
341115,interested security cosmos
341116,would affect validity connection
341117,jackzampolin trying represent impossible
341118,clearly
341119,regardless love youre buddy pleasure always 3 im sure ill see twitter thread shortly haha
341120,23 eth valset would sign state transition invalidated ibc connection
341121,good work raise excited see layerzero products
341122,say ibc need trust chains running
341123,yes honest main chain fraudulent external chain relayers validators colluding
341124,thanks lets chat person sometime soon im sure ill catch conference
341126,looks like fixed blacklisting contract think contract buggy allows nonstaker unstake amount
341127,lol funnylooking function
341128,yes blacklisted contract avoid transfer tokens hackers
341129,function

341145,
341146,sounds retarded may use rough language
341147,oh
341148,im retarded situation
341149,yes see
341150,ok fail
341151,good investigation guys
341152,make blocksec startup
341153,staking contract blacklisted
341154,asking users vote get less money lol
341155,whole ecosystem playing hot potato would want turn money printer comp eventually die incentive program aave eventually rotators rotate world turns meant last beyond first years liquidity incentives
341156,look a16z half vote course
341157,true plenty protocol's fine without money printers yearn maker uniswap etc
341158,shocker
341159,think there's something said 'lindyness' something like compound aave vs new lending protocols high incentives yes hot money rotate new things noncrypto biz fintechs institutions etc looking yield partner they'll looking compound aave new hot money thing casual reading seems like gfx presented good arguments cutting comp rewards 50% drastic impact tvl seems like concerns around felt rushed cutting incentives 0
341160,know 
341161,bolting governance onto centralized products launch greatest idea
341162,built deep level cosmos many votes changes take place chain immediately
341163,
341164,take look osmosis governance real busy great turnout
341165,lets see a16z come uni
341166,ser bragging cartelized dpos network like cosmos rich
341167,2019 called wants narrative back
341168,also ibc federation pos chains pretty decentralized construction
341169,i'm bill gates' grandson
341170,think see compound governance much centralized going cosmos even individual chains
341171,
341172,
341173,done anything note worthy recently seem lose market share
341174,2019 called wants narrative back
341175,tfw compare random dapp multisigs broken consensus model
341176,think call consensus model secures hundreds billions production broken
341177,worry fit narrative guys gone great lengths passing pos total decentralized
341178,i've heard get coming sorry like proof stake
341179,would need change situation golden number nodes call decentrlaized
341180,lol level eos claiming decentralized ethereum paintjpg screenshot
341181,ummm nakamoto coefficent higher eth 2
341182,hub
341183,continue parrot outdated criticism cosmos model real boring theres real activity chains ibc far away used interoperabilty model
341184,nodes irrelevant brokenness dpos
341185,brokenness please expand ser
341186,nodes producing blocks every 5 seconds
341187,call outdated enough times go away
341188,continue say others
341189,stating thing make true tho
341190,says one regurgitating criticism outdated
341191,well keep saying pos broken without backing facts
341192,entire retort embarrassing tangent multisigs
341193,propositions path forward
341194,embarassing
341195,calling cosmos cartel 35 real cartel
341196,wtf tweet lol
341197,point think ridiculous tangent relevant ryan talking
341198,well
341199,
341200,mean continue dominant individual area's pretty incredible feat given industry hot ball incentives products work well retain market share shows need play ponzi games product good enough honestly know yearn fee structure easy way outcompete crazy ability retain talent mindshare
341201,saying every protocol glorified 35 multisig stupid untrue
341202,want people argue good faith take seriously gotta better
341203,i'm saying i'm saying many
341204,eth people make 0 effort understand built cosmos i'm tired old takes reflect reality would also ask better
341205,tweet says
341206,well vast majority eth defi contracts owned multisigs single signer keys
341207,base
341208,please correct i'm wrong
341209,ryan network cartel well things built network cartelized therefore something hope irrelevant saying
341210,anyone wanna engage point
341211,also cosmos cartel
341212,mean one largest defi protocols existence technically 35 multisigcertainly conversation worth
341213,top validators different chains disjoint set
341214,thank robanon
341215,know define think acceptable multisig looking top 10 tvl ethereum though would say reasonable level decentralisation protocol level
341216,granted think multisig far better halfbaked governance abandoning ownership even better
341217,reasonable level decentralization
341218,abandoning ownership best
341219,that's blanket statement can't apply every protocol
341220,what's point yearn abandon ownership
341221,would define cosmos hub would take 8 top validators colluding halt chain
341222,even 100% apps ethereum would still irrelevant 
341223,jack knows
341224,many defi protocols top 10 would meet bar
341225,think irrelevant
341226,look recent bridge hacks
341227,that's he's brought distract said
341228,think top 10 two protocols halted
341229,state actor beginning take interest space type security things need discussed dealt
341230,many entities take exercise control protocols
341231,best often reasonable unattainable goal strived reasonable milestone set many cases certainly figuring abandon ownership time ideal obviously longer go without breach battletested code considered
341232,
341233,color surprised lol
341234,
341235,list
341236,i'm pretty sure top 10 admin keys behind
341237,admin keys
341238,whats actual security offered protocols
341239,upgrade contracts
341240,could also used steal funds
341241,said two top 10
341242,know wormhole polygon hex admin keys least
341244,bet dug would find
341245,clearly clue talking
341246,bs list sorry

341248,well share better one
341249,exactly list
341250,
341251,210 upgradeability

341446,hey ser yes yearn discord tesseract channel deployed polygon avax atm sadly hickups last 2 months hiring time weere bit slower adding new strats changing speak
341447,thx god token less shitting 
341448,hi guys ideas mass send tokens cex
341449,depends cex basically move funds automated relayer script proceed bulk transfers
341450,wanted address exchange appear withdrawal wallet
341451,build script would call cexs api withdrawals

341464,perfect thanks
341466,gm lobsters finished writing article storing crypto securely opsec tips awesome references hope useful3 
341468,decentralization
341469,anyone solidly talk discord channel link
341470,agreed beginning stablecoin innovation journey im currently looking yieldbearing stablecoins never leave wallet
341471,hi guys smart contracts hood execute abc function b public returns address return msgsender function abc public returns address return thisb opcode thisb
341472,dont understand call delegatecall callcode
341473,check volt protocol
341474,watched trailer golden
341475,stableunit working well
341476,frontend domains owned dao avoids single person owning eth domain avoids dns names bound censorship tied single email way make frontend updates make governance proposal turned rep holders found bad update rep non transferable governance token earned contribution dao way achieve handing ens domain dao proposal created update ens point new ipfs hash voted boosted governance process passed ens points new ipfs hash google analytics analytics depends upon centralised parties want privately use uniswap sushiswap always use swapreth directly talks contracts without taking fee routing another contract pretty decentralised compared every frontend would say
341477,call like crosscontract call
341478,hmm tells entity rather individual owns ens name frontend decentralized uniswap dao tornadocash filter bad addresses frontends
341479,dao control frontend uniswap labs
341480,single person deploying changes dao 
341481,dao can't control website front end
341482,
341483,sure ethsites 
341484,uniswaporg controlled owned new york private company
341485,thats
341486,hey trying research token came across something weird take look pools positions generated erc20 tokens 0 usdc anyone idea going
341487,someone owns domain pays server bills thats person control dao decides matter regulators legal perspective
341488,well speak blockchain dns ie bazar
341489,wondering
341490,eth domains ipfs frontend
341491,ens uses ipfs free nothing centralised needed
341492,icann always look registrar
341493,well eth ipfs hash gets around
341494,someone's name always
341495,one talking icann
341496,aware thats case uniswap tornado right
341497, set dao address able modify records fully chain 
341498,werent talking uniswap tornado either
341499,kind scroll
341500,attempted misdirection might interesting cryptonians think we're dao makes frontend decentralized darknet helped last guys got rekt
341501,saying read process deployment decentralised extent deploys chain traceable saying deploys go dao never said dao 
341502,isnt point took steps necessary dao decentralize frontend
341503,one thing we'd need change core allow
341504,come system depend icann like ens
341505,need need full shadow dns system
341506,asked dao hold water
341507,hmm that's valid point dao considered legal entity instead community case website frontend truly decentralised
341508,sure mean terms reaching existing social system tech top
341509,also let people download frontend verify contents run main problem interferes usability security concerns impossible principle comes tradeoffs people seem ready
341510,true thats say dao dapps org fi icann websites kinda feel cringe
341511,intelligent reply
341512,dao doesnt mean frontend agree stuff alex
341513,sushi claims decentralized owns sushicom
341514,single person
341515,daos frontend 
341516,like dao make frontend decentralized whether dao constitutes legal entity that's probably gonna end thorny conversation uh governance token there's nothing welldefined govern
341517,agree tradeoffs long deploy process takes 5 days us update ens point new ipfs hash 
341518,governance use holographic consensus token based pretty resilient towards whale voting buying tokens pass proposals
341519,check frontend deploy goes onchain governance 
341520,hmm frontend available ipfs achieves flow similar effect hash that's guaranteed point files look see hash one updated onchain txt record ens controlled contract onchain governance
341521,wrap way that's digestible average user make sure slow fuck we're good go way see people like already easily run access decentralized frontends that's matters product like uniswap
341522,hmm that's browsers like brave services like ethlink comes guarantees still exist way access abstracted away perfect ofcourse introduces points failure still way average user access site
341523,someone needs host though something ipfs offer anything either case need think hard shutdown let cloudflare case see ethlimo says lot without saying anything reading links medium content privacy policy tos certainly quite interesting
341524,right initial pinner still liable afaik
341525,one run ipfs pinner
341526,ofc higher technical learning curve downloading running locally back start
341527,think circling back yicalex's point tradeoffs
341528,probably started decentralized frontend even mean maybe owned x surely
341529,id lean towards controlled x
341530,controlled governed x x single person multisig
341531,process slow fuck sincerely believe need towards frontend decentralisation
341532,skeptical tvl since time protocols started printing farming shitcoins locked 90% supply protocol integrated shitcoins another farms part tvl especially funny see bridges stablecoin farms billions tvl liquidity utilization around 01% alternative metric tpv total productive value 
341533,ethereum similar would decentralized frontend would tornadocash need filter addresses
341534,dont understand filtering addresses would help optics looks great hackers cant use frontend etherscan contracts still open source used right
341535,point need even optics ui decentralized
341536,least decentralized frontend one defined frontend decentralized even though allows limitless access x nobody shut
341537,obviously succumbed legal pressure tornado dao sufficiently decentralised maybe wouldnt filtered addresses first place
341538,rugged ivangbi booth
341540,
341541,merge expected ard august
341543,ser let eat brb soon
341544,would dao benefit social communities quite get point good existing examples dao already benefited social communities understand brings selfpolicyselfgovernance community cannot see dao would big social environment maybe im missing crucial point
341545,
341546,notice said strange 
341549,allowed add single side token uniswap v3
341550,v3 pool
341552,add 342901 usdc pool
341553,simple staking smart contracts study
341554,masterchef sushiswap
341555,great write add discussion tvl shouldnt tied tokens market cap ratio often see metric sites tokens goal isnt match tvl amount dont see correlation apart speculative valuation tvl tpv case eyes lifeblood protocol high tvl equates healthy protocol high usage liquidity trades team getting paid vice versa low tvl imo narratives got change point ratio mctvl meaningless would better estimated annualized inflationdeflation rate %

341589,thats important ever take working phone sim pc attending public place described 
341590,nice confirm he's one got pocket
341591,still 100% confident wasnt tbh
341593,u expand ivan tech u mean
341594,great means recommend people switch foundry harthat like testing given zero switching effort upsides enjoy
341595,pure solidity dev hacking foundry way benefit hardhat js test suite serves live documentation really useful case since i'm working frontend developers new web3 since use tools js tests mostly ethersjs could check highlevel specs implemented instead poking everything also hardhatdeploy really confortable use there's equivalent yet foundry least last checked discussion github implementing deploys solidity well get point context switching needing learn two languages point feels like using wrong tool job
341596,
341597,
341598,similar concept mainstream good search engines within apps coingecko example search nonindexed term returns error example error correct
341599,interesting zerion debank zapper edit much drink zapper right 
341600,zerion one shows historical chart portfolio balance even tho right completely broken addresses
341602,also press coinmarketcap coingecko go search bar
341603,use combination ddg personal settings bangs worth look eg eth

341619,gm sir please join daorelated things3
341620,looks like soyjack
341621,make difference return value function returns uint256 foo returns uint256 return foo preferred due convention thx
341622,unless becomes possible host frontend network like would contract probably going work
341623,agree fontend hosts always going liable anything happens provide could protocol make worth people host front end via financial incentives
341624,posted premint link ml spots cryptofighters alliance anyone interested want spam chat welcome see link
341628,i'm looking buld something track hisorical balances address converted dollars would grateful suggestions plan collect historical data something like ethereumetl modify lib make work chains i'm less sure get pointintime pricing data historical holdings coins wallet could find liquid pool time hand picked selection dexs farming positions guess could go protocol protocol figure price lp tokens historically eg uniswap v2 v3 need custom solutions simpler way get histprical pricing holdings require special treatment protocol thanks pointers
341629,zerion one shows historical chart portfolio balance even tho right completely broken addresses
341631,well thats interesting 
341632,nice read imo wdyt

341636,100 keth
341638,subgraph best option
341640,dmd still trying help couple ppl luck
341646,first case require explicit return foo usually results less lines code also uint256 foo 1234 needed function body identical functionalitybytecode afaik
341647,hi sers top money markets solana good competitor solend innovative stuff
341648,hey lobsters nft platform without fees royalties
341649,hi anybody using aiml blockchain applications kind challenges facing planning launch move2earn web3 app uses computer vision algorithms tracking want know need train run ai algorithms decentralised way
341650,hi lobsters please let know zapper project project good potential upcoming days 1 year passed still launch mainnet
341651,hi read messari article aboud stakinkg derivatives eth derivatives currently represent originally staked eth plus earned staking rewards since december 2020 ankreth projects underlying value currently 1 ankreth 1051 eth true steth lido real price steth 1 eth
341652,steth rebasing balance every day
341653,got thx
341654,total supply steth represents number staked eth rewards
341656,subgraphs sound like good option would need subgraphs every protocol adrress may used main concern maintainability especially since personal project without team
341657,francium novel competitive lending rates
341658,
341659,ive heard neptune wonder theyll
341660,isnt tulip well
341661,sudoswap otc tho
341662,solutions either argent gnosis safe combining dad grant hardware access 1 hour shift funds around example gnosis safe one keys grant full access work 1hr access removed automatically believe argent flavors functionality really someone else control wallet obviously useful fully trust person
341664,couldnt update gnosis accept one sig change back
341665,well 75 years old know use computer maybe getting argent mobile confirm message that's think get argent signer gnosis wallet might looking
341666,done mobile ledger x personally i've never tested blue tooth could prob usb otg tho function called ledger gnosis safe phone
341667,tried gnosis mobile app
341668,downloaded awhile ago l2 support bailed away
341669,gnosis set allowance given account way expire automatically thoughas far know
341670,yeah need separate gnosis chain afaik
341671,im looking leading insurance protocol firm looking engage insure smart contracts risks linked stablecoin dex amm usage connected w etherisc nexus mutual ams seemed great start anyone research whos got projects mind happy hear 
341673,ever technically possible smart contract wallets cross chain functionally least ethrollups need one deployed rollup
341674,anyone idea check many holders signatories multisig
341675,gnosis open multisig website click signers settings
341676,rollups technically possible already done actually atomically send l1l2 messages viceversa protocol decide messages actual crosschain difficult since atomic security
341677,know least starkgate want check actual code erc20erc721 bridge starknet
341678,yeah cross chain important good know could easier eth rollups
341679,using orbitor difference stargate
341680,one zksync
341681,pretty much idea compatible since starknet evm
341682, one
341683,got
341684,got one well
341685,fishy indeed got though never used opensea apart connecting wallet
341686,yeah dm
341687,received one wellfrom teamopenseaio probably scamdont remember providing email
341688,guys emails hardware wallet breach great list phish
341689,i'm touching link provided never crypto stuff
341690,unfortunately also personal one think use burner lessons learned kek
341691,bought hardware wallet breach 
341692,maybe still available public lol
341693,sure
341694,checked really opensea remember field faked
341695,certainly opensea issue scammers got email addresses first place
341696,hey good faucets get testnet eth google seems indicate even getting 1 full eth testnet hard hardly anyone gives 3 socials even socials 1
341697,try one faucetparadigmxyz
341698,yeah best distribute risk though setup doubt there's financial incentive sufficient push comes shove
341699,needs twitter 15 followers
341700,wait wtf saying replied w pvt key get opensea airdrop
341701,unslashed
341702,hi researching alternative chains ecosystems tried find main drivers tvl ecosystems growth looks like 1 first dex 2 first lending 3 convenient bridges 4 hyping nft collection 5 mb also local stablecoins necessary elements defilego andor could drivers rapid tvlgrowth also ecosystems representation matters could achieved powerful patrons ftx solana kwon terra andor strong marketingtop vcs aurora time see algorand dex yep hacked kind common thing defi lending nftmarkets vcs 150 mln tvl think possible formalize drivers could lead rapid tvls growth algorands problem missed parts mosaic easily fixed eg bridges bit marketing tvl explode problems deeper
341703,1 vcs 2 everything else
341704,yeah would work similar working already liquity
341705,came across extremely clever scam discord scammers even managed get xxxx number username

341778,yeah wonder viable get rid centralization
341779,wonder viable 
341780,probably market way around everything lol
341781,ser believe try precisely deploy delta neutral strategy basis trading difference call dynamic hedging sounds looks like basis trading dumb ass tbh dynamic delta hedging options trading strategy aims reduce directional risk associated price movements underlying asset done selling purchasing options underlying asset purchasing amount underlying asset options even futures ensure delta portfolio 0 investor aims reach delta neutral state docs there's nobody team da house would could could post explainer difference mgavaudan could explain difference smol brains like
341782,well lemmas part know strategy primarily options based rather perps based
341783,taking direction perp earn funding hedging spot put simple terms possible

341786,basis trading defi primarily based carrying equal amount spot perp contracts aim delta assets cancelling theyre delta 1 1 aim ur collecting perp funding rate basically risk free theres need rebalance except managing ur margin portfolio delta spot futures dont change mgavaudan attest basis trading doesnt scale well defi protocol unfortunately chain perp rate arbitrage even could hard sort pvp tradfi think basis trading could options idk sure ive seen basis trading derivative defi typically defines everything differently would say basis trading first definition defi
341787,we're building rysk uses options primarily also use perps spot manage delta could say yield comes harvesting volatility gamma depending want look reason reply guys dont think volatility mispriced lol something alabeda making markets ultra efficient time decay delta comes pool prices incentivise purchase derivatives move delta back 0 whilst pool aims delta 0 dream delta option changes hedge needs dynamic say uncorrelated instead delta neutral unlike basis trading static hedge
341788,dynamic hedging delta hedging spot moves
341789,theoretically hedge options delta perfectly continuously realized vol implied vol options purchased u would break even

341796,solidly stable pools uses curve kx3yy3x otherwise kxy bitoken pools
341797,hard add 3 pool relatively speaking available pools support
341799,add current solidly implementation afaik impossible pool deployer immutable
341800,would involved adding 3pools hard wondering included
341801,balancer nearly successful curve tho seems superset functionality curve
341802,higher slippage traders always prefer curv
341803,balancer well many basic uniswap v2 dex's either superset less slippage
341804,uniswap competitive advantage wellknown ui people go routes uniswap pools case marketing works balancer ui unusable back day good guess curve competitive advantage well spinned sustainable governancesubsidy system pupm important pool earlier stableswap crypto pools also performing somewhat better constantproduct alike
341805,advantage uniswap ui well marketed fairly big uniswap2 usdtusdc pool making quite good apy even constantproduct invariant consistently getting traders rekt
341806,crypto pools also performing somewhat better mean curve pools crypto
341807,curve crypto pools v2 eg tricrypto crveth 
341808,balancer implements stablecoin algo stablecoin pools
341809,clones alternatives expected token economics curve something protects moat rather intellectual property things whatever
341810,part protects moat well 4y lock convex sort translated 16 week lock
341811,lock
341812,feedback loop feesdao emissionsusers
341813,solidly alter uni code formula fork curve pools code
341814,stablecoin pools solidly uses special formula adjustable parameters infinite liquidity density middle think
341815,solidly basev1pair contract literally goes like pool stable use x3yy3x otherwise use xy stable flag set pool creation
341816,heh
341817,what's curve 3 stable pool mathalgo boil
341818,well number coins stableswap invariant
341819,curve oss code basic ui runtest 3 pool contracts
341820,led zeppelin
341821,brahma finance
341822,solidly based curve 3 pools support adjust formula kxy volatile pools wanted nice curve math explainer 
341823,curve advantage defined market stables opposed every token ever uniswap
341824,idk think andre wanted experiment bit
341825,seems better many volatile pairs supported
341826,embrace extend extinguish
341827,heh
341828,maybe work fork curve uniswap
341829,well mean
341830,try saddle finance
341831,codebase isnt everything
341832,curve uniswap aesthetic distinct
341833,could used stableswap invariant really wanted figure pretty nice experiment must say
341834,balancer
341835,summarizeelaborate
341836,
341837,like experiment
341838,teach man fish etc
341839,like bonding curve parametrized becoming dense stablecoin stabilizes
341840,especially latter
341841,pretty interesting
341842,mean like formula x3yy3x 
341843,wen procedural liquidity provisioning ser
341844,bad support 3 stable pools think bother supporting they're big deal
341845,dont forget bancorv3 soon
341846,looks interesting
341848,haha love scroobius
341849,especially nice shimano reel
341850,bancor v3 innovative like first amm omnipools trip 1 big pool tokens thereby guess also allowing unlimited 1sided il free staking infinity pools il even paid 3rd party tokens autocompounding rewards where's oss ui code tho
341851,blog yet explain omnipools infinity pools set prices though guess revealed later 
341852,possibly dumb q pays metamask infura rpc free use everyone
341853,legally speaking ofc know go use endpoint without permission
341854,i'd guess omnipool gets prices regular pools
341855,data pays
341856,
341857,vpn bypass bites dust
341859,vpn nothing change 0xbad banned user
341861,move funds another wallet bit hassle much
341862,read screenshot
341863,prevent withdraw move funds use new wallet maybe need coffee
341864,indeed
341865,decentralized finance
341866,heh well hardly hardest blow system hit back buckle
341867,yeah we'll see funny defi platform devs think appease euus
341868,think normalize geoblocking based ip front ends enough trick normies difficult overcome via alt uisinteract directly
341869,really cannot euus go crypto anyway prevent escape depreciating shitcoins
341870,elaborate can't withdraw move funds another wallet use vpn use app
341871,ser see anyone make point
341872,easier tough guy ass that's gonna go jail respect regulations
341873,mean moderately interesting tangent sure meh
341874,indeed sir
341875,well kind get bitcoinmonero developed anons
341876,withdraw move funds another wallet said
341877,learning interact blockchain without relying frontends good thing anyways drive decentralization levels

341901,they're nft security experts 
341902,
341903,giving bayc holders lot credit assume know check contract see others interacting
341904,that's fair
341905,even know etherscan debatable

342094,back reality ser
342095,yet passed gov needs approve also elections sunday need wait new gov yes quite crypto friendly much first proposals
342096,thought another attack using mev would possible someone broadcast transaction buy let's say mutant ape still ability claim apecoins someone could frontrun transaction maybe even flashloaning eth buy ape claim apecoin sell ape interested buyer eventually sell repay flashloan
342097,could buyer protect case
342098,already done nftx apecoin launched
342099,yeah first ones hidden tax thatbwas decided based various random reason could lead 50% correct im wrong though
342100,done slightly different
342101,interesting know
342102,sure would work moment frontrunner buys ape transaction original buyer fail
342103,yeah doubt
342104,probably dont understand scheme would someone frontrun buy transaction buy transactions make difference case believe anybody buy apes still collect airdrop collect airdrop return back wrong
342105,mean attacher would free ape could buy ape knows someone else bradcasted transaction buy ape price beeing sold attacker buys x price claim apecoin sells interested buyer x price got free ape buyer end ape apecoin
342106,said would assume transaction original buyer would fail sure case
342107,done lending platforms exchanges maybe thinking along lines precondition kind stuff basically return nft within transaction opensea allow
342109,case borrowed apes course good idea borrow apes claim tokens fine
342110,frontrunning someones else transaction different story though
342111,thing buy nft someone else special angle somehow inject middle buy claim forward person frontrunning
342112,thanks
342113,exactly question
342114,essentially even current status tax crypto unless profession exact rules become trader strictly set x amount trades days decided casebycase clear triggers investigation comes prove trader best luck trying collect tx history new bill would simplify lot lot lower tax 5% really cheap tbh
342116,apparently us dod forbids sha256 ec different curve bitcoin top secret systems mean crypto
342117,broken

342492,yes
342493,yes
342495,someone lying internet
342497,engagement
342498,unheard people finding guessing private keys funds tho
342499,google ethercombing
342500,yeh articles thinking couldnt remember name ty ty
342501,private key accidentally uploaded public repository thats part training dataset ai model
342502,sure message point private key isnt magic depends key generation
342503,really funny farmers trying drag conversation spread fud real users affected
342504,thanks sharing posted updated airdrop farming evidence proposal fix easy 
342511,articles threads stepn tokenomics gmtgst im interested learning different axieslp terms burning recurring sinks mechanisms
342513,literally thousands wallets unclaimed eth find hard task find unclaimed wallets golden
342514,legal precedence like rummaging trash dont want legal advice ill take article want read something
342518,unclaimed eth need find wallets unclaimed eth technically legally one owns unclaimed buddy found 94 eth last year one wallet
342519,good otc channel advise thx
342520,anyway set state variables within view function
342521,that's entire point view function
342522,im thinking library call somehow
342523,pay gas
342524,caller
342525,use view function
342526,call view function signing anything sending actual transaction mined
342527,whole point view function query current state blockchain without initiating transaction
342528,hmmmm
342529,maybe fallback
342530,caller contracts interface
342531,contract needs implement
342532,view want change state contract
342533,staticcall guess
342534,can't view plain simple
342535,fails directly compilation stage even
342536,would want change state function view function
342537,caller function sends data want store
342538,contract iercmycontractviewfunctionuint xxx uint bbb
342539,need save xxx bbb
342540,understanding view functions definition modify state 
342541,yes hmmm think way
342542,honestly probably look design rethink external interface provided something view function done facilitate constraint calling particular function cost gas change blockchain state whole point interface guarantees contracts implements interfaces constraints breaking break tools maybe working assumption external calls function free
342543,try fallback staticcall guess
342544,hey sirs could please share easy useful crypto tools simplify life like 
342545,ultrasoundmoney
342546,best way wrap eth
342547,check compendium 
342550,use uniswap
342551,awesome
342552,incredible amount work appreciate
342553,death taxes nice one wonder safe mode let recovery instructions pass away
342554,great started already using checking key contacts insurance section guessing sort simple ranking would genuinely help ie github commits vintage year community
342555,eitherway genuinely appreciate work
342556,hey yesterday launched something really exciting built way allow users seamlessly swap chains without leveraging bridges trades mev protected try tell us think
342557,
342558,yes good feedback thanks glad like site
342559,brilliant ty
342560,find details works technicalities
342561,publish technical blog post next week general outline follows mms manage pools chains hold inventory assets native chain trader requests quote mms use inventory issue quote trader submits tx onchain one transfer happens source chain network validators relayers confirm tx deliver payload destination chain perform second transfer
342562,pricing handled offchain via signed rfqs get around things like sandwich attacks crossdomain mev cuz theres nothing front run
342563,managing mmsvalidatorsrelayers
342564,aight thank ill look forward technical papers
342565,frens technical question im sure create multiple accounts metamask one private key compromised attacker get pks related one
342566,like reverse pk seed
342567,
342568,iirc
342570,right acct still
342571,think im 100% sure
342572,seed phrase got installed mm gets compromised lights everything
342573,yeah 100% dont know go pk original seed
342574,
342575,copilot find suggest private keys cant gpt3
342576,one could've achieved interchain messaging chainlink's ccip multichain's anyswap since goes series validators difference relying standard bridge
342577,
342578,there's almost chances revert seed private key mathematically impossible two metamask accounts generated seed phrase accidentally expose one account's private key attacker wont able reconstruct wallet's seed phrase therefore account's private key
342579,doesnt add bigger problem control order flow trade users similar citadel robinhood
342581,generally view problem long users choice take quote like anything allowing mms price discovery better market structure allows essentially price asset limited spotblue chips obv certain degree centralization around price discovery think ok trade long centralization choice forced upon anyone via monopoly gatekeeping
342584,obv certain degree centralization there's anything wrong uh decentralization enter equation described
342585,trading completely decentralized permissionless youre custodying funds anyone full control trade submission receive quote
342586,permissionless means decision use yeah means anyone use i'm curious happens validatorsrelayersmms get request someone that's exploited protocol also noncustodial sure decentralized mean
342587,need mms actually handle pools tap existing liq pools cross chain settle need bridge period matching mm rfqs wont settle origin destination chain bridge right pools stables let's say want sell bnb get eth two trades bridge happen bnb stable stable moved stable eth
342588,
342589,we've built contracts modular validator sets including l0 wormhole nomad axelar launched alpha l0's oracle relayer model planning allowing users chose validator sets depending comfort level risk valditors relayers mms compromised collude time attack vector
342590,that's use bridge using generalized message passing perform two trasnfers swap eth bnb right 
342591,since u shill openly marketbuy least 1 nft 
342593,need pools stables
342594,people want trade stables there's whole lot users still convert stables various chains
342595,need use stables proxy
342596,part flow mm rfq system instead swapbridge solution
342599,one stables
342600,yes
342601,remove endless stani spam please saw tweets back made conclusions need spam stuff
342602,nah mms still quote stables tiny spread mechanic swaps stables stables exciting users still keep using native long tail assets atleast
342605,dont verify contracts etherscan 
342606,shortly complete audits rn we've limited trade sizes tvl kept product beta
342607,saw talk trustx days ago still sure 500 year justified anyone sub peter opinion depth
342608,idk universe living
342609,omgggggggggggg shook
342610,thought joke lol
342611,
342612,cool stuff
342613,
342614,nice fantasy though let's tokenize elon's new 44bil toy drop everyone like 200bil play name one thing can't web3fy tokenize airdrop mean perfect business model literally anything
342616,sybilfarm elondrop
342617,doge tweets
342618,provocative gets people going
342619,44bil would top 5 marketcap
342620,nice move gno proposals burning 7m gno 70% total supply funding gnosis chain ecosystem growth initiative 
342621,anyone knows status element governance surprised almost one month none proposed making token transferable
342622,would proposal like pass though
342623,how's burning tokens better dao benefits current token holders tho make much sense dao burns assets could govern spend creating something useful
342625,wanchain partened cardano serve evm sidechain cardano
342626,backs bushes
342628,hey i've written guide reading transactions case study olympusdaos zapstake functionality hopefully help readers use metamask txn window learn details transaction use etherscan navigate smart contract codes detect transaction wants take money 
342629,evmos second try airdrop called rektdrop goes live 1600 utc 
342630,always called rektdrop
342632,sure belongs nft avenue defikingdoms bug really get terminology people unlocking tons locked jewel going
342633,apparently devs told january held governance vote nothing implemented
342634,technical 
342635,oh right thanks correction guess memory gets fuzzy trying go back 8 weeks
342636,would love know thoughts 
342637,huge issue rn tbh andre point regulation
342638,think elliptic pretty awesome regard wallet screening risk scoring without need kyc
342639,see source funds known hackers
342640,regulation maybe come outside tho however really hard problem solve
342641,100% agree crypto gotta learn regulate traditional kyc defi would heartbreaking see
342642,know uniswap wallet screening like surely must blacklist
342643,blacklist frontend
342644,always balance pro regulations think general sentiment regulations increased mass adoption thing often word crypto associated tax evasion people dont understand technology
342645,sell stuff local marketplaceflee market money receive robberytheft make money clean tainted
342646,opinion money get return sale asset clean long asset stolen
342649,probably know aware source funds b say sell item 10x even 100x market value one may argue certainly
342650,finally published first part open everyone's feedback improve scoring factors useful everyone ps tablesdashboards protocols stables risk scoring open models data etc none making mvp potentially useful community
342651, official statement tldr send miner quest game checks see locked bag start end middle send miner quest one per wallet transfer locked bag jewel wallet wallet there's 10% chance hit jackpot unlocks jewel people using bug unlock tons locked jewel
342652,reference jewel dex harmony tokenomics similar bao get yield front locked
342653,hey could anyone tell there's way check whether signature tx harmful
342654,mean know change received lovely farmer bought chicken cash involved terrorist attack legit concern considering blockchain public open ledger much easier scan detect things unlike parliaments thinks thay easier criminals wash money crypto

342723,yeah exactly
342724,anyone claiming lying
342725,swap 10e doesnt work
342726,much apy would want new good looking project lock tokens 3 months could claim end versus claiming rewards continuously 2x higher
342727,trade limits currently ramp liquidity
342729,much liquidity add liquidity like lp mining
342731,rn 7m tvl

342773,10m
342774,nope 
342775,fair today roosh liquidated 105m ftm many transactions biggest one 2m ftm fueled competition among arbitrage bots course network online time gas though surged 20 000 gwei time 1k gwei enough ttf half minute
342776,referring tweet
342777,still says lot even concern
342778,well poor roosh responsible network congestion bunch ftm projects today approx 25% drove users interact network hopefully foundation proposal lower required amount ftm validator scale tps consensus mechanism ftm asynchronous
342779,crash pay transactions btw that's means since ftm boys used low fees 23 fees outrageous minutes also go metamask default estimations ofc
342780,ok tweet regarding reason loan lie devastation would cause chain way liquidate chain crashed hour
342781,like exaggeration
342782,different meanings different people retail uses daily default metamask go crashing
342783,little bit hyperbole
342784,i'ts beyond common put custom gas ftm anyway see even hinting something touching nerve i'll leave convo

342858,
342859,good luck
342860,rekt fei
342861,fei fuse
342862, common thing large defi protocols could aave curve uni etc also pause withdrawals ie actually custodial
342863,curveuni cannot
342864,aave afaik
342865,yeah permissioned mitigation logic
342866,many hacks happening lately true gathering attention big players also true 1 protocol exploit week growing gonna kinda hard
342867,imagine telling fund might risk capital exploiter
342868,audited certik
342869,certik saddle sure bout fei
342870,also kinda useless get audited launching stop think protocol huge tvl undergo periodic security auditing otherwise shit like keep happening main problem everyone trust protocol others already
342871,fei audited zeppelin
342872,
342873,last audit july 2021
342874,they're pretty diligent getting audits also making ts dotted internal crossaudits
342876,generally speaking getting constantly audited protocol matter
342877, quantstamp audit fuse
342878,lotta repays redeems coming
342879,funny always coincides general dowtrend
342880,possible get hacked
342881,pretty much eyes boomers btc except 2022 currently still long way go outperform traditional assets always everytime stuff like happen feast
342883,
342884,peckshield wild lol
342885,can't detect simple math vulnerability code reviews still face post kind stuff
342886,people talking auditing firms instead pointing correctly ones shit feeding beast audits work auditors liable point shit factorylike auditing firms peckshield pessimistic etc
342887,tetranode what's going
342888,lol
342889,recycle reuse
342890,seems auditors liable extent part audit agreement that's something protocols negotiate part contract opposed general liability sort thing
342891,guys sherlockxyz testing theory love team check
342892,agreed overall there's lot talks auditing world moving status quo here's pdf invoice good luck
342893,lmao
342894,nah auditors liable people specifically know auditing firms give fuck reputation avoid even represents product launching 6 months due queues firms
342895,particular reason think projects negotiate sort arrangement seems like helps align incentives properly
342896,making auditors liable would put 10x premium audit prices would 10x slower
342897,comment
342898,think service still desirable maybe every auditor think would good
342899,solve anything rather makes extra difficult thing execute downside issue arises time future
342900,would seed stage protocol pay 500k 1m audit raised 15m
342901,ahahaha uniquely qualified say wouldnt pay 500k
342902,ive exact situation
342903,well that's 10x i'm referring hehe
342904,lossloss projects auditors
342905,think adequate approach could include insurance pool audit process
342906,fair point costtime increases think realistically auditing firms would purchase insurance know market like assume bad expensive
342907,yh thats sherlock
342908,audit market market auditor customer demand far exceeds supply everywhere queues several months advance curb demand many auditors prepare code test software solutions unfortunately fall far short human eye hand still unscrupulous customers want cut dough soon possible instead making good product
342909,protocols buy insurance issue users concerned ones buying insurance
342911,yeah misspoke meant auditing firms
342912,one cares see nxm's revenue
342913,auditing firms pay 3% premium 100m tvl per year protocol
342914,yeah think correct market seem learning lesson firms like peckshield
342915,want cynical value audit stamp produces revenue without security secondary since exploit 612 months road matter already cashed chunk profits
342916,plebs stop suggesting security practices like first time happened literally retarded sorry rude like every time hackexploit genius starts suggesting holding auditing firms accountable auditor deposits contracts making certik memes etc
342917,u fan pessimistic checking
342918,bit aggressive sir think concept holding people whose negligencepoor work accountable outlandish concept certainly outside crypto plenty damages irl negligence inspectors like answer might seem obvious looking inside protocol building getting audits obvious work end
342919,know 1 experience terrible
342920,wrong discuss things 100th time genius ideas thrown around thats whats annoying haha 3 much love
342921,agree w luciano said
342922,feel hired bunch people ogs took mgmt position
342923,alas enough time read lobsterdao archives 3
342924,thats issue concern 
342925,nobody would ever work w premise sorry makes 0 sense
342927,
342928,ideas different dull dull
342929,back sick nvm
342930,agree hearing arguments discussion i'd
342931,scuzi need find aspirin
342932,u boys discuss read
342933,new intern edgy tone
342934,can't wrap head around tho lot beforenonreentrant afternonreentrant
342935,reentrancy
342936,fucking gall account
342937,can't believe peckshield still song dance every hack
342938,sorry ivangbi that's unoriginal point
342939,auditing space fundamentally broken static code checks 1 million dollars year please ah think thats expensive suck sunshine everybody else charging shit buidlers
342940,peckshield provide inputhelp finding issue back guys hacked getting audited
342941,particularly that's really point i'm making
342942,point unique insight post tone deaf matteroffact tweets almost every exploit body count well billions point gall
342943,3 exclamation points jesus christ
342944,know trying gather data points projects audited bad experience ones better input kind criticism
342945,like horse race
342947,mmmm nothing entices builder flippant braggadocious auditing firm laughing fellow builders i'm definitely going use peckshield future really value professionalism
342948,emm hacken isnt bad seems lol
342949,already costs much though depending clout auditor see bean figures
342950,whether adding liability would cause 10x debatable can't charge nobody willing pay that's happen there's enough demand willing pay current rates there's incentive anything change
342951,bean paid 500k audit
342952,350k tob 250k halborn least afaic remember voting thingy
342953,sounds like something would need change insurance end things hard see happens
342954,
342955,wonder insurance costs similarly risky things mature insurance market anyone know
342956,though maybe good parallels
342957,
342958,yeah one older tob one 
342960,think fair 40k per week peckshield charges 12k per week
342962,yeah 10x feasible top tier audit firms one
342963,also reference compound's openzeppelin contract 2m quarter 160k per week specification amount auditors people involved
342964,fair suppose methinks something tad weird end result buying maybe probably lose money using regardless happens promise hold us part whole liable statement statements would claim much
342966,
342967,wtf dfk one jewel
342968,kids got rugged latest people behind
342969,isnt jewel defi's kingdom token harmony game afaik
342970,frens shilled back
342972,safer never use 777 benefits using erc20 warrant using w checkeffectinteracrion pattern implemented correctly
342973,jewel first intro yield farming uniswap fork w gamification pretty cool features behind farmed got 95% lock 5% unlock exploit found allowed people unlock remaining 95% dump market mods knew months anything
342974,theres twitter thread iirc can't find
342975,looks bad parties involved especially since many kids liked jewel gamification
342976,pool 2 token basically insane apy hidden game ct guys shilled hard play2earn exit liquidity
342977,first subnet avax good precedent set
342981,know included we're satisfied came
342982,step copy stepn would thought anyone thinking actually trying serious stealing money gonna wonder one point ever believed lol
342984,lol true garbage guess ye 
342985,found 2 critical vulnerabilities audit
342986,auditor market completely broken going c4 contest way budget timing doesnt work get toptiers way
342987,thats smth bad audits one found smth audit covers everything unless mistakes mistakes trivial ye sign
342988,one pretty trivial skipped lost complete respect also vulnerabilities report clearly automated tool human doublechecked
342989,c4 also great confirm super demanding team's tech side
342990,know audit find everything impossible bug bounties exist
342991,definitely can't complain audit quality choose certain cheap auditors
342992,ah able execute contest yet seem pretty timeconsuming generate report right
342993,go rubber stamp audit get rubber stamp audit
342995,yeap knowing rubber stamp question misleading inform audits
342996,toughest part retail users want audits big budget rubber stamp idk maybe better try inform community side
342997,getting real audit increasingly difficult scrutiny good firms want deal anons want audit projects think reasonable chance getting hacked top long wait times insane rates mean protocols cannot go real audit yeah get pay people realize audits worth
342998,that's auditing tho insurance that's different mine field
342999,yeap reason auditor market broken basically demands incentives completely align least yet c4 strives good middle ground imho
343001,helping bridge huge gap
343002,want audit projects think reasonable chance getting hacked even mean
343003,means speak nobody
343004,ah clout huh
343005,weird way phrase though
343006,time set clout dao funnel everything
343007,well yeah kind limited resources get two audit requests anon team another aave know one better business well one least likely get hacked
343008,perhaps earlier comment settling cheap audits problematic
343009,agreed complicated aspect could apply service needs carry insurance liability reasons medicine least us decent perfect analogy physicians carry malpractice insurance think means they're practicing medicine though
343010,great auditors ignore cloutless booked 500 years projects clout course said great business projects look great portfolio also pay nice fees come surprise cheap auditors chosen
343011,mean i'm blaming teams go cheap audits pointing realities finding auditors current market
343012,ux benefits token transfer triggering contract pattern never really caught defi devs especially newer ones often dont recognize reentrancy risks
343013,yeap seems pretty fcked situation theory market balance new auditor firms come lot prices times could taken dev eng could get 10x making token whatevs whats incentive midtier auditing firm
343014,clearly still lot rinse repeat ecosystem need
343015,aave critical vulnerability went unnoticed year missed multiple audits luckily security researcher reported responsibility collected bounty could let complete protocol drain audits often bullshit
343016,damn remember one sushixsushi one listing claimable assets value per share instant manipulable
343017,oh yeah tob actually found 
343018,ty tom

343047,what's interesting solana downtime really affecting people willing use solana build top solana
343048,understand distributed database
343050,mean sam office would stop building solana 
343051,aws msft google offer distributed dbs
343052,offerings formally verified consensus mechanisms enforcing operations
343053,cosmosdb tla spec github even
343054,whereas solana well noop
343055,
343056,use term strictest definition ymmv

343075,stepn launch bnb yet right game also player verify
343076,stuff sol bnb chain
343077,might player activation code system wasnt annoying 
343078,lanched separate account solana use solana bnb could use bnb also functionality works thing isnt work depositwithdraw
343079,least took something around time last times solana went rather true
343080,stepn joint dorahacks solana hackathon selected finalist get funding dorahacks team leaded binance quite surprised binance support still deployed sol
343081,cheap txs mainstream love security sustainability matter
343082,speculation take fact coordinating need order restart probably yuge task last time think 19 hours got back
343083,think lt yuga okay bears wanted take position bears binance rejected withdrawal l transferred usdt ftx floor 3x original time interest
343084,
343085,lt means done
343086,binance also cheap txs though
343087,understand agreed restart chain certain block

343155,lol another distributed db entering mix 
343156,shifting blame
343157,optimise contract move new chain
343158,cobie already submit ceo apechain
343159,love position decision consequence happened today completely doingdidn't gas optimize contract beyond important things could done meanwhile already made decision apecoin released ape token ape coin
343160,
343161, wrote something business management side crypto
343162,sharding done right
343163,wait apecoin chain we've landed
343164,i'd bet rollback chain scams occur lol
343165,yeah people actually need want nobody retail actually cares block shit muh decentralization ugly ux ui m3an still using metamask hello
343166,smart contract optimization blame ethereum make l1 isnt another way squeeze ape community
343167,cryptokitties chain flow much hype since nba top shot success
343168,quite simply decentralization reason crypto start normalizing centralization different fiatexcept wed putting trust tech startups vs centuryold establishments argument crypto would lost decentralized tech kinda sucks get better time
343169,aware ethereum infura conensys eg metamask investors backers
343170,one backer internet us dod
343171,smart contract optimization would make gas fees less case centralization would though guess thats yuga heading
343172,factor yuga would polygon
343173,can't roll back chain return stupid stolen ape user tho
343174,would consider eth holding dirty point lp wasnt aware shouldnt liable
343175,muh jpeg outgrew ethirium chain users wont hassle managing private keys seed phrases store safely protec
343177, unoptimized erc721 sc understanding mint process huge gas wars begin need chain 
343178,
343179,
343180,yes hand erc721a im curious use analogues
343181,cause need leave preference lands bayc mayc claims 130000 ids
343182,erc721a nature beneficial multi mint eg one mints 10 nfts one batch lands minters restricted 2 per wallet erc 721a would beneficial mint causing higher gas consumptions trading
343183,didnt know restriction thanks
343184,seriously though amount gas fees paid case lands depend gas optimization everyone competing get land others causing priority fees higher higher optimizing contracts case would lessen gas paid overall would change split base feepriority fee gas optimal contract would benefit miners benefit priority fee
343185,less gas usage mint txs block madness ending much faster even though amount eth paid minters would change much
343188,like pixelvault take care fans avoid gas wars
343189,totally crazy saw post paid fees mint project month 
343193,i'm convinced they're complete idiots part marketing strategy totally know tho right
343194,basically spent average 1 eth per mint 55k mints possible burnt 55k eth nice thing beneficiaries unless trying transact auction would raised mint price 1 eth per mint theoretically could captured value instead going burn
343195,
343196,big txs
343197,
343198,looks attempt
343199,guys send good defi tools like one 
343200,ust 9b flipping luna happened yet
343201,technically impossible understand something
343202,tool calculates eth spent particular smart contract's lifetime
343203,ultrasound tell major ones
343204,meant gas spent ryt
343205,say luna mkap falls ust issued stays additional ust minted via purchasing luna yes
343206,yes exactly
343207,completelly possible technically
343208,ust collateralized luna price drops one burns ust sells ust happen
343209,happens ust mc greater luna mc
343210,zedseee
343212,anybody minted nft yet airdrops optimism users 
343213,broad maybe vague macro datasets metaverse gaming nft messaging clear though typical consultants liked line regarding mass adoption though half surveyed executives say lack standardization accepted currencies across platforms impacts viability digital assets within gaming industry 47% cite high transaction fees many industry insiders believe mass adoption come users buy sell nfts ease purchasing item online single click
343214,want think exploits defi drama we've encountering past days also spilled luna ust ponzi scheme
343215,yet wil keep going fake 20% stops paid
343216,legit safe
343217,idk
343218,able mint didnt sell
343219,claimed nft missed airdrop ended feb

343223,oh ok think aurora whole near ecosystem making lot steps considering amount money backing near ecosystem see lot progress made glad attack resulted attempt another exploit
343224,money gone heard funds turned back 10% apy new stable near might fud might pretty brutal pull back since implemented stable coin low yield

343865,yearn v3 vaults solidity vs vyper end era
343866,v1 solidity
343867,didnt know would actually interesting article hear decision process worked go sol vyper sol
343869,think machi involved
343870,tron dao launched usdd 
343871,take award complicated bridging history shaking fear reading
343872,wtf scrolling alone takes day
343873,aka super sketch
343874,question usdd bridging
343875,earn 30% apy risk free 
343876,v3 also solidity
343878,
343879,
343880,main reason number developers know solidity vs vyper fact decision made soon current version vyper released release vyper ruled though
343881,one read homepage times i'm still entirely sure saying send tokens n addresses create bunch contracts address one contract someone call execute actual distribution creates bunch contracts disperseapp otoh goes straight point zero fluff inputting addresses also pretty simple compared table thingy split site
343883,one looks really shows immediately use send tokens n addresses spends lot time talking talking may useful something n addresses
343884,incredibly cool
343885,splits doesnt send tokenseth directly addresses instead gas efficiently updates internal balances allows recipients withdraw doesnt store data split ie address list percentages split actually provide every time call data
343886,get etherscan update proxy ui updating beaconproxy implementation still pointing previous implementation abi onchain everything updated correctly beaconproxy contract pointing new implementation contract
343887,try rerunning proxy checking tool right though say yet native support beaconproxy todo might bit wonky relies completed transaction's delegatecall trace implementation
343888,thank reply tried keeps suggesting old implementation contract would really cool one could manually pass implementation address try make call rerun rinkeby case makes difference
343890,yea get native support able track updates implementation addresses much better 
343891,worked made call new implementation thx
343892,interesting that's clear homepage suppose problem assuming niche something like disperse
343893,share team thank
343894,involve transferring ownership tokens
343895,hey guys i've made technical guide nft metadata immutability hope insightful 
343896,appreciate arweave awareness
343897,would say missing arweave integration wrt metadata easy use dev tools evm nfties
343898,i'm particularly aware average bulk nft drop prepared arweave everything centralised server terms storing assets metadata rules apply easily get files arweave use ardrive arkb cli
343899,im wondering isnt every nft project using solution like seems like brainer must annoyingdiffciult
343900,free like ipfs
343901,costs ar tokens
343902,imagine barrier
343903,yeah getting tokens guess rather cost
343904,anyone wants send small amount cover uploads cheap
343905,barrier imo temporary nature store everything storage chains least end
343906,arweave futureproof thousands miners incentivized store data hundreds years come
343907,take protocol labs ipfs spend lot effort getting projects launch stack even though ipfs mostly server basement protocol labs headquarters
343908,ipfs masterpiece propaganda everybody thinks store stuff decentralised
343909,haha yes actually arweave huge amount money flowing ecosystem projects
343910,fund things i'm involved infrastructure makes easier get content onto arweavw chain
343911,makes sense sorry
343912,admit expert would like use chance learn possibly help others learn reach conclusions let ask questions
343913,ok sure happy try answer
343914,first basics pay x ar store 1 mb file ar put chain used kind basis inflation paid store file give take
343915,side note arweave also contender eip 4444 proposal store ethereum's history
343916,there's kyvenetwork specialised storing chain history arweave easy access
343917,inflation fixed supply cost scales based formula takes account cost storage often hdds break
343918,every piece data stored arweave slightly overpays fee goes long term endowment compensate miners
343919,ok fixed supply preassigned given host files others paid ar arpaid files replicate fixed supply reserve assigned time based oracle estimated hdd costs
343920,i'm sure true fixed supply reserved given miner yes generally correct oracle price adjusted update
343921,yellow paper realm i'll find link
343922,
343923,okay lets assume economy tuned last 200 years pay 5 ar today 1mb file live 200 years beyond one gives shit since dead futurechildrens problems every bit media weaved bit media data presupposed everyone repin least data though select since weave linear right
343924,i'm sure get question general idea incentives dictate profitable miners store much weave possible
343925,called upon bit data recall block can't produce can't mine next block get reward
343926,ok jive builtin censorship module specifically
343927,profitable
343928,choose propagate content continue blocks content line linked produced
343929,profitable paid customer profitable anything else
343930,choose serve part weave step able prove recall therefore step mining rewards proof random access algorithm selects block proof miners
343931,
343932,hey guys i'm dev yeild aggregator recently gone public allowed post link docswebsite
343933,seems conflicting incentivized host everything regardless evil
343934,yes protections beyond nodes filter evil factor
343936,
343937,something make sense still screen content opt repost supposed repost per protocols rules randomly sampled protect kicked miners
343938,two layers architecture miners gateways gateways http endpoints choose bar content
343939,miners could example gateways
343940,ok many references shepherd actual miners propagating content gateways makes economic sense anyone store everything
343941,youre saying nft project dont use arweave think makes sense doesnt make nft decentralized
343943,way yeah mostly trying learn usp
343944,chose token barrier believe store everything chains last censorship potential still trying wrap head around
343945,someone ban fembot begins
343946,tag admins next time pls 
343947,5 ar payed incentivize storage 200 years happens ar crashes price 50% file stored 100 years instead
343948,ar recognized currency real world value matter yes entirely possible due price crash lack interest ar goes zero point becomes economically impractical host files due cost much profit even idle machines storage bits weave start disappearing availability becomes low one able continue chain thats mean storeeverything chains infeasible
343949,
343950,well said

343977,tfw mentioning something shill
343979,good review contributors rewards one compensation team token allocations 
343980,course there's alternative eg suggestion would already improve situation quite bit 
343981,alternative chainlink mean can't push chainlink better
343982,theater
343983,gives warm fuzzy feelings something done let's honest theater practically useless interesting attack 
343984,oh baby think could get worse
343985,ronin's hack would believe anything could happen
343986,updated 
343987,ehm that's exactly could prevent define primary secondary aggregator switching instant 320 case primary failure want add new aggregator switch need wait eg 12h
343988,pray tell even 500 layers aggregators anything regulatory attack
343989, get mean main issue right need 320 sigs instantly switch fraudulent selfdeployed aggregator solution proposed could still need wait 12h therefore give protocolsusers least time react
343990,read
343991,yes still get fear regulatory attack answer 320 signers solution
343992,welp carry
343993,wow good discussions thank valuable input
343994,point going back forth can't bothered read genuinely think suggested anything regulatory attack golden bridge nft sell
343995,wdyt thread direct rebuttal per se specifics 3out20 thingie discussion kinda address problem iwo 
343996,address much explain way things unlikely change much trustworthy network least afaics anything like chainlink inevitable trust chainlink never gets rekt least realize happens get rekt far really gotten rekt trust largely justified still however trust feel free crank multisig 1920 4950 even privacyconscious distributed setups plucked apart
343997,yeah kinda agree besides goes directly truth trust motto chainlink
343998,usually happens team member toxic dao let's assume toxic member community voted position toxicity realised public channels vote remove person proposal look like toxic encounters leaked anyone examples would appreciate one pops mind latest sushi debacle
343999,case case basis imo voted dao time immediately comes mind example
344000,one comes mind one ens 
344001,time simpler toxic encounters public knowledge issue happened dmsprivate chats
344002,hand toxic community member would dao
344003,thats true example using dao replace team members safemoon havent following closely ive heard theres shenanigans tied
344004,great question dao guidelines chats broken removed chat vote always valid tho
344006,must code conduct approved dao punishment resolution procedure dao delegates token balance voting
344007,thing exists create first
344008,inevitable could implemented optimisticlike model
344009,devil details semantics defines dao team member decentralised dao theres operating entity constitutes team etc
344010,anyone explain dns vulnerability leads modifying contract addresses website post mortem attacker used dns vulnerability modify router contract address hosted files understand exploit uses dns redirect that's vulnerability dns service that's problem implementation securing credentials account registrar see hacker could used dns replace contract address ui code without access host cache access files i've asked discord received answer 
344011,redirect
344012,isnt post mortem cya around sucker goodbye note devs
344013,like hacker would edit dns records targetvictim site point fakemalicious site 
344014,defi projects dns based attacks resulting loss funds
344015,yeah aware dns vulnerability allows editing html grants access host unless there's trust dns entry host able modify files without credentials
344016,dns protocol allows many things eg stream video dns however editing html static files one aware
344017,yeah trying track specifically going dns could used replace contract addresses could modified midstream content encapsulated https apparently users prompted approve malicious contract malicious contract loaded host claim fixed instantly wonder changed password reverted file
344018,nextdns service use helpful protecting kinds attacks sure would helped situation thought would share 
344020,

344030,
344031,actually good q even 
344032,figments imagination used exclusively pitch decks 
344033,trying throw shade orca cant imagine much daus general
344034,love see solana cyber bullying lobsters 
344035,going stepn app think stepn app 150k daus possible orca guess
344036,
344037,dont underestimate power move 2 earn revolution
344038,ah okok totally makes sense
344039,defining daus
344040,ips addresses
344041,mean understand stepn works right
344042,like metamask wallet u toggle addresses vm whatever nonsense
344043,mobile game phone
344044,150k phones pretending step
344045,pretending step
344046,friends gf gf buying shoes joke shit ponzi got real adoption
344047,looking latest popular collections looks like 90% volume created bots 
344048,idea 150k actual humans day using step tracker app solana almost ridiculous idea 150k actual humans day using solana dex
344049,lmfao 
344051,well income u get stepn walking daily higher average good job singapore isnt low income country
344052,another gud ponzi
344053,afford shoes
344054,ok saying one hundred fifty thousand individual human beings using every day
344055,vs like ten individual humans running tens thousands phones
344056,
344057,like dont even know find 150k people could tell solana
344058,tbf didnt say individual human beings said app mobile phone
344059,i'm sure that's exaggeration
344060,theres probably alot 1 human 10 phones though
344061,well beauty think average stepn user uses without knowing solana
344062,like isnt goal shit build eventually
344063,sure that's fair
344064,ok actually ask u app whether u want solana bsc depositswithdraws something thats
344065,i'd say implied actual dau
344066,infact sol bag holder bots
344067,would worrisome otherwise
344069,course
344070,91k stepn shoes minted lending released yet idk 150k possible app require shoe
344071,people get idea need walk
344072,actually produces worthwhile rewards people reverse engineer whatever mechanism hardcore bot unless limit account creation lot kyc something get drained rewards become low main argument x2earn ponzi doesnt actually require tasks solved humans even would eventually need actual income stream isnt emissions
344073,trying say stepn user doesnt even know address using app phone
344074,
344075,pretty much whip together shaking contraption strap animal end thing
344076,well yeah stepn another ponzi collapse eventually enough people exploit like axiescholars
344077,short lmao
344079,talking much
344080,like 150th fitcoin thing solana
344081,line thinking proof work magically imbuing value
344082,whats best way control exploit like p2e games ip blocking frequent phone number authentication kind way blacklisting wallets similar root wallets
344083,never stop bots end time
344084,looks like 2m exploit mmfinance dns redirect digging discord messages seems people reporting invalid ssl certificates time exploit initially reported
344085,
344086,asked soz list addresses identified sybil attackers already hop found 
344087, someone shared already
344088,
344089,
344090,gfs love shoes
344091,anyone rabbithole team accidentally found vulnerability allows anyone get admin panel interested best way report issue
344092,team probably best reach discord 
344093,misleading clickbait tho 
344094,ohwait sam kessler name rings bell think getting heat piece another protocol can't recall exactly
344095,probably referencing first article juno felt dive deeply enough background ccnthe whale frankly fair criticism imo week's episode interesting case study around validator responsibility definitely trying pump clickbait ill towards juno folks spoke record super thoughtful headlines generally worse tweets comes capturing nuance
344096,submitted feedback trying dm admins one cared lol
344097,nah juno piece first time read juno coindesk olympus maybe can't recall matter guess
344098,ah lawsuit doxxed one olympus's founders coindesk posted article back guess back forth around incident
344099,sustainable
344100,never ask 1 woman age 2 man salary 3 defi protocol sustainable yield
344102,yes completely literally possible flaws system

344143,shhhhh
344144,insert 3la airdrop
344145,question would prefer projects gib steps taken removing airdrop farmers b attempts remove farmers airdrops
344146,c airdrop
344147,given fact i'll sell airdropped tokens within two weeks care project looking new responsibilities
344148,call whistleblowing 3laspeak wen whistle token 
344149,actually one question users airdropped since already enjoyed service
344150,unless farming arguably ev across airdrops attempt made exclude farmers data based opinion
344151,wen whistle
344153,snitches get stitches could good campaign 
344154,whistle managed snitch dao
344155,proceeds successful snitch gets distributed rektor team responsible takedown
344156,arguably enjoyooors likely incentives aligned show loyalty brand think op's modifier active governance also gd indicator gamed that's done
344157,sec inaugural placeholder member dao
344158,whistleblow another 3la cbdc accounts frozen social credit score permanently locked zero
344163,wondering team identify reliability reports manually
344164,aboard time dying projects try pretend relevant dying breath grasp community via token look optimism hop good way bootstrapping liquidity
344165,optimism lower tvl harmony ffs hop 110th stargate die already
344166,web op token 
344167,ok optimism slightly harmony snx 41% optimism ghost chain token wont revive
344168,hop dying
344169,personally like governance approach they're taking sure would enough revive beneficial
344170,dying going anywhere either crowded market euphoria wearing token launches address underlying issue better competitors pie shrinking every day launching token going hurt retail ape get dumped defi protocols need tokens
344171,admittedly followed stargate hop recently bridged 2b volume token sound like project going anywhere turn token incentives help compete
344172,fantom

344178,america sale dont daft
344179,token 8th wonder world ser
344180,stop youre making much sense fren
344181,reason new tokens use eip2612 know erc777 reentrancy issues 2612 seem like suffer issues
344182,idea utility could add chain art solana something like hight speed node like cubes
344183,possible filed fbi report rugpull like geist
344184,would sir risk environment innit
344185,rugpull though farm dump token exactly designed marketed
344186,i'm sure calling fbi cause lost money degen farm qualifies
344188, 3ac vs lfg drama
344189,dude slowly losing shit insanity there's huge shining vibe tweets
344190,founder 27 bil mc could distanced reality saying
344191,yes figured comes gigaton pressure especially building plane flying
344192,also taking lot stupid sides
344197,winning attitude crypto otherwise end like andre
344198,id say hes one elon musks crypto space right proportion course
344199,he's good builder sure much structure built props doubts
344200,sad possibly true
344201,dear fbi lost money buying token thought holding would make rich therefore rugpull pls something
344202,emn rug pull 
344203,thats regulation coming port big enough
344204,manage force banteg andre return money
344205,speaking force considering even ui thing anyone get forced torture finagling approvals etherscan put money random contract hoping they'd get richer
344206,one getting bug metamask can't scroll list wallets try connect one wallets 
344207,scroll offset keeps bouncing back top
344208,
344209,bullish
344210,great way know farm taxes away
344211, machine learning predict apy stability 
344212,mmm documentation relating could pretty problematic didnt see anything docsllamafi
344213,hi cant access balancers discord ill ask gauge tokens bstethstable gauge tokens transferable 
344214,optimism bridge slow
344215,machine learning kinda useless tasks probabilistic approach work almost impossible make generalisation financial signals large number participants involved
344216,guess predict changes tvl farming rewards 
344217,example changes tvl last 2 weeks pretty low apy stays otherwise tvl increases predict much changes later understand affects apy
344218,hey i'm copywriter specializes working projects web 30 talk writing work
344219,hey jacob looking one mind dm
344221,biweekly update polkadot ecosystem lot stuff happening 
344222,could see machine learningpredictive modeling useful im means expert farming id think features like pool age tvl apy relative similar pools would fairly predictive stability pool new high apy compared similar pools would expect apy converge market rate
344223,one main challenges information resource asymmetry participants insider information simply money generates massive randomness model model obviously aware information
344224,see transfer transferfrom methods would say yes
344225,model would far perfect im pretty confident would possible significantly outperform random guessing devil details success effort depends features modeling approach principle much easier forecast future pool apys something like stock returns tho
344226,would someone make random financial decision tho majority aping larger pool based reputation
344227,know lot people give good feedback 
344228,random guessing referring benchmark models predictions evaluated ultimately hard say good mode without seeing outofsample predictions
344229,pool apy higher order form stock return doubt could learn constants pool formula data give much predictive power
344230,reasons mentioned
344231,worries
344232,shitcoinstablecoin classifier outputs little emoji column everyone happy one gets hurt 
344233,exactly apy doesnt represent total return il changes values pool tokens short horizons stock returns less mean 0 almost autocorrelation apy always positive autocorrelated also things like incentives schedules may make things predictable
344234,open sourced model also 
344235,tyvm really helpfull dashboard
344236,awesome stuff appreciate free api ser 
344237,tbh get people find strange actually really easy tell naively whether apy drop example aave launched polygon easy tell 2030% apy last long since trusted platform battle tested sure enough lasted days apply logic masterchef pools launch see spike apy drops predicting things like quite easy see issue train model
344238,almost every crypto participant also able tell usually product launches apy high high risk untested lot people want risk time goes product doesnt get hacked apy goes simple prediction yet proves possible predict apy stability
344239,literally generalisation financial signals large number participants involved easy prove true empirically look defi launch
344240,reason simple risk goes time apy goes
344241,i'm saying unpredictable ml model redundant imho defining probabilities 51% 94% make much sense
344242,exactly think crazy teams set high apy distributions early days launch give majority supply handful degens prepared take risk little likelihood sticking around long term
344245,whats alternative ml model case would probability describes confidence forecast case llama believe easier use sort model describe relationships variables rather manually handcraft estimates something using model case provides scalability generalization
344246,reason defi founders large spike tvl start creates massive bug bounty protocol doesnt get hacked signals everyone protocol trusted trust lasts forever since assertion security smart contracts
344247,clarify model predict prices apy predicts probability current apy hold small forward looking window
344248,remember big data protocol
344249,anyone kept aftermath 80 million dollar bean exploit chance
344250,tvl apy protocol name enough imho aggregated chart looks dope would need probabilities would rather keen know what's averagemedian reatail position size
344251,case something closer proof capital founders traded token supply marketing
344252,ser else number go
344253,hehe
344254,guys topic validation cosmos gitopia project promising opinion
344255,like maybe build good product dunno though sounds bit think
344256,source available somewhere
344258,
344259,make make easier understand short sentences explaining interpret algorithm pool pages one stetheth pool convex
344260,algorithm predicts current apy 429% fall 343% within next 4 weeks probability 9900%
344262,dont like feature simply dismiss see people finding reasonable using ape pools low probability apy staying level
344263,see makes lot sense 3% steth staking apy unlikely convex pool gets extra emissions stable apy receives trading fees would drop apy threshold
344264,i'm trying convince anyone else friendly opinion discussion
344266,question two members situation involve people 2 sats 1 open discussion person topic problems 2 open discussion inside team part team hope find solution 3 work question means toxic like person racist insult others etc see brought bigger crowd possibly involves voting u always first call smaller group big stakes dao making full public funds whales active contributors etc choose wisely talk easily see someone oriented profit success protocolcan decide call le dump etc think way u wanna present open discussion always great get feedback fellow contributors u trustbefore 4 public discussion voting people mentioned ens thing example goes category way hope helps wish closure make best situation 
344267,thank thoughtful response 
344269,actually saintsal think share things core team alignments general team drama solving hopefully help even
344270,what's point sounds redundant
344271,makes easier also need apy dashboard since could go frontend every single protocol write apy numbers paper purpose dashboard make things easier purpose metric instead look apy tvl history every pool look every protocol see likely sustain apr use metrics heuristic save lot time
344272,metrics kind super alpha generating thing make life little bit easier
344273,lot case thanks hard work peeps
344274,find useful thanks dashboard
344275,ah let clarify mostly referring ml part seems less like ml proof agethis old rest makes sense though
344276,core ml identifying patterns point think arguing semantics tho
344277,check code tho open source
344278,love new dashboard building yield optimiser perfect
344279,congratulations launch great step forward defi

344323,published article counterfactual smartwallet system revest using value storage looking way central contract deposits allowed system become insolvent march attack we've figured entirely new paradigm predict address contract live future using eip1167 send user's value location inaccessible storage location ready withdraw use eip1167 deploy selfdestructing clone address withdraw value 99% time contract living address one deposit always map one address meaning attacker withdraw much value address associated deposit access sharing hopes inspire others defeat insolvencybased attacks 
344324,feel like needs talk gas cost implications especially ethereum
344325,see that's trick eip1167 incredibly cheap maybe 80100k additional gas works call selfdestruct cloned smartwallet transaction deploy avoids writing vast majority state storage
344326,

344397,tkstanczak hinted onchain gas derivatives impossible requires starknet stuff cause computations r expensive might paraphrased wrong
344399,think amm solidly bilidly models would work ethereum 001% fee ie nearly zero fee swap would relevant pay 80 swap except large swaps
344400,requiring speed network rarity ac extensions built base game aka composable nft architecture would much painful user achieve less auditory 10ish fees interact

344428,0 fees scam
344429,wait really
344430,hi admin can't join 
344431,exactly believe swap functions optimised comparing solidly's xyk pools uniswaplike got lower fees possibly lower gas cost comparing solidly's stable pools curve got lower fees lower gas cost execution liquidity concentrated much much lower reasonably sized swap mainnet would incur much higher slippage outweight feesgas savings

344456,contracts unverified nobody really knows
344457,everyone farming
344458,fomo first complain devs rugginggetting rekt later
344459,devs side assure security though always usersdevs asymmetry knowledge skills
344461,asymmetry irrelevant unless forced use thing
344462,anybody running pocket nework node happy tips begin
344463,plebs know using services stake iicc1 might
344465,unless something changed last 24 hrs i'm pretty sure single person money stuff saw gun manifest heads forcing put money i'm pretty sure it'll emn 20 blaming something happen
344466,asymmetry relevant decision making process tad complex magical free like saying okay scam people force buy wrong many levels
344467,meh okay scam absolve personal responsibility
344468,sure expect see fewer scams market twists pretzels excusing provisioning market scammers
344469,yeah looking blaming people systemic solutions beside can't expect everyone know contract read etc start started 0 knowledge speech personal responsibility good help solving anything
344470,blame people think good idea fomo first ask questions later hence providing market scammers scammers saints
344471,taking problem wrong way blaming acknowledging reality interactions engineered differently users protected builders
344472,imo
344473,can't expect everyone know contract read etc start started 0 knowledge could stay away things understand know better chuck blame somebody else
344474,never understand something fully also overestimate knowledge lead catastrophy moreover stuffs learned case crypto generally least form empirical experience theory teach
344475,really contradict i've said
344476,anyway let's agree disagree
344477,guys knows projects similar gitopia ones want overshadow github make separate platform web3 code
344478,radicle comes closest mind
344479,want try start 
344480,guys tool service allows track token emissions feeding smart contract address think dune require extra steps big brain

344953,luna price looks scenario
344954,pleb speculating dont sell probably get line credit extended usdt use defened peg threat defending peg bring front runners already closed gap dos words might even use btc done correctly
344955,demand terra blockspace right luna 1 probably ignorant buy pressure terra users outside anchor
344956,luna
344957,34b 16
344958,fully diluted vs non fully diluted isnt important point wanted liquidate every luna right defend peg luna would hit 0 could ust's peg function btc reserves luna liquidity measure reserves liquidity harder measure liquidity market cap necessarily linked
344959,fully diluted 34bn pal
344960,would possibly use fully diluted imminent implosion
344961,yes banks work well
344962,banks dont sell stock prevent bank run
344963,good example market cap liquidity linked chia coin launch 0 liquidity exchange marketcap rocketed 500m someone actually tried sell 10m worth chia would crashed price 0

345003, sure real time though
345004,i've found updates daily
345005,whoever debt denominated ust might interested
345006,thought shorting usdt play
345007,im surprised ust supply hasnt shrunk yet
345008,youd think thered arb bots buying burning 600m
345009,daily redemptions long capped could anything devalue right i'm missing something
345010,ohh wow yeah thats even worse
345011,
345012,luna price 30% last 24h 600m decrease supply ust
345013,
345014,lfg must buying straight ust burning supply wont change
345015,says 100m ust per day seems range 50m
345016,yea that's understanding
345017,wait would 600m decrease today according cmc
345018,never mind im idiot
345019,that's 7% dip p
345020,price lol
345021,everyone bashing luna shoulda sold top luna went hundred x past year average cost low many vulnerable huge drop
345022,look people paid see big potential drop
345023,effectively right cap maxed luna stability mechanism besides lfg
345024,usdtust kucoin 01% spread amazing market makers keep operating environment
345025,arbitrageurs r still interested
345026,remember early 2018 liquidity much worse crisis
345027,arb though
345028,market arbitrage
345029,trust faith
345031,
345033,literally since milly able exit market luna whales normal users getting 7% chop deposits
345035,
345036,seems likely case
345037,great timing 
345038,poor guys
345039,yeah sucks
345040,world turns burns
345041,sheit sorry hear man stay strong buidlers unite 
345042,said fe security sucks best luck devs use vercel cloudflare
345043,probably vercel hijack though
345044,mean leak weeks ago
345045,never seen vercel successfully hijacked thought whole thing api keys case please enlighten
345046,leak know tbh guys still investigating
345047,sure i'll inform info i'm dev support guy
345048,sorry heroku
345049,know right malicious code somehow injected via js code
345050,makes sense sounds like describing insecure js anything
345051,may well dns hijack well gotta make sure deploy there's gonna postmortem sure
345052,
345053,redeem 095 ust 1 luna sell usdc since luna crashing
345054,ah yes oauth tokens please use 2fa annoying kind shit easy block
345055,cant theres 50m max per day point possible ust would stay 1 whole luna went 0 ust would go 0
345056,sauce
345057,dude like 30 messages also recall researching ago matches recollection
345058,easy check peg supply shrinking massively isnt
345059,10 minutes ago delayed depositswithdrawals cex problem
345060,reserve thingamabob limit redeem thingy
345061,would peg hold everyone would arbing peg would stay 1 luna nukes
345062,emergency update ust live twitter spaces feel free join us feel free join listener want add speaker well
345063,everyone problems terra network congested cex nodes lagging
345064,one everyone monolithic models theories would believe everyone held would rich
345065,whats reserve thingsmabob understand dont know name supposed
345066,afaik thing supposed buy back peg limited figure per day avoid draining attack
345067, idea frens
345068,probably sold last line defense idk anyone know wallet
345069,peg back
345070,5%
345071,wait hows different saying point top limit much ust redeemed luna
345072,wut even going dextools reporting 98
345073,what's oracle say
345074,dunno trust anymore
345075,reserve randoms luna
345076,anyone know time daily limit resets luna
345077,maybe limit exists though docs
345078,doesnt mint new luna redeem ust thats process thought limit makes sense limit avoid infinite issuance type situation like iron finance also means currently really backed much anything even luna
345079,limit def makes sense otherwise luna price would get crushed immediately arb crowd least gives lfg time react everything goes totally shit
345080,binance suspended ust withdrawals
345081,besides redeemers also arbitrageurs buying spot markets 095 selling higher hit 1 make money maybe algo stablecoins need insurance product insures peg insurer one constant arbitraging optimizing algo algo stablecoins would work better least partially backed commodities go zero fiat either thinking aloud 
345082,sell higher
345083,buying praying price goes doesnt count arbitrage 
345084,
345085,restoring ust peg
345086,peg back also can't sell anymore

345316,ust got wide adoption
345317,used payment method whole new level
345318,monthly option
345319,
345320,next one
345321,15 mil actually tiny needle market
345322,ust experiment shows flaws copy paste ust decides exactly expects different outcome well played justin
345323,cause jsun 
345324,joke aside pure makerting movelike el salvador bought dip yesterday
345325,yep course nothing original ever comes camp
345326,really happening copypasta projects taking long hard look underlying mechanics probably dont understand try learn happens scale periods high volatility
345327,think justin used stealing everything doesnt even bother making theories anymore
345328,meanwhile near thought bringing 10% stablecoin similarsame ponzinomics smart idea
345329,thought justin left tron bring defi south america something
345330,algostables trade directional risk exposure collateral time decay instead i've seen one tiny protocol something general direction cannot unfortunately locate
345331,uxd
345332,think summarize luna issue simply didnt enough btc guarantee peg next time better buy 34x much
345333,going help environment falling btc
345334,dont think good ponzi theory works try assume reacts fails
345335,probably one expected implode
345336,implode mango cannot pay big price movement lack liquidity mango liq fund depletion
345337,liq fund uxd's insurance fund
345338,mango liquidation fund
345339,thats excellency
345340,thought uxd hedged derivatives instead actual tokens honestly felt like smart way get volume mango ftx markets like directionality hedged stable sounds good itll lot less efficient doubt itll get adoption environment everyone exclusively chases yield
345341,probably perfect storm equities commodities bad day yesterday hedges
345342,real irony seems tether right along hide reserves exist everyone assumes might dump like doesnt impact one model whatll happen unlike luna feels like bad lesson
345343,thats worst idea ever
345344,human thank much reason asked audit usdd
345345,real giga brain move would turned whole thing purpose go massively short ust let fud get hand soon dumps nothing let dump harder seems doomed unwind short massive profit put lfg announce 5x collateralized stable hed come well smarter real lunatic held fuck people sold pray god
345346,yes kinda add exchange counterparty risk mix even interesting mango going settle stable pnl usdc actually also exposed
345347,oh yeah dont particularly like either lots risk marginal extra capital efficiency
345348,
345349,abracadabra
345350,central bank restrictions buying eurdollar retail sanctions almost need buy cuz buy nothing useurope matter retail business sp real demand moment export works still selling gas oil even eu countries pay rubbles measure pay gas rubbles response sanctions demand rubble real exchange rate see demand change fiat crypto 7379 rub

345361,yeah regulators would love move even south korean one bet
345362,im sure wont love imploding either yeah youre definitely right
345363,dont see going like lfg related entity market making either matter long actively trading stuff seems like major reg risk
345364,retail actually get hurt manipulation gets regulators' balls tingling justice
345365,think likely would short ust
345366,oh mean agree unlikely probably bad idea saying would hilarious would near certainly work outcome would crazy
345371,would interesting seeing overall pnl luna foundationlfg jump capital 3ac alameda luna ust related activities
345372,someone probably shorted right 
345373,least hedging shorts
345374,yeah feels like anything coming alameda always gotta read lines technically say something true dump despite never actually lied
345375,
345376,says selling ust mention example massive perp short position technically selling ust etc hedge risk entirely would even net benefit implosion
345377,ofc we're selling stg bought pre sale mean farming hell market dumping 'rewards'
345378, get answer cmt

345422,evidence 
345423,literally call lunatics
345424,previously reluctant holders rush get correct i'm wrong 16b ust circulating that's water according coingecko 60mm exit liquidity largest pool accounting slippage 120mm daily exit burn mechanism best seems like fire crowded theater kinda scenario vcs looking get asap right
345425,think much less circa events even first day redeeming around 12bln iirc
345427,less circa meaning vcs mms heaviest bag holders never sell retail exit first also ust anchor mean can't withdrawn exit
345428,even assuming doesnt go 0 itll probably lot harder convince people go anchor 16% yield risk perception dramatically different seems like pretty much entire attraction luna
345429,give market much credit
345430,remember last umpteen times someone said things would different big event barely 2 weeks later business usual
345431,indeed
345432,think like iron
345433,iron still around near
345434,replace anchor bitfinex time haircut people memories goldfish space would agree situation potentially salvageable
345435,speaking luna bagholder got wiped think real shortterm comeback terra would entail ditching downplaying anchor strategy redesigningrecalibrating stability mechanism facelift narrative

345442,hethey look jsun
345443,think ever fully recover ie get back 18b market cap
345444,btw anyone stats justing ponzi tvl collateral etc
345445,trying kick strategy viably drive demand ust anchor yield that's linchpin ecosystem failure attempts diversify demand away made anchor
345446,looks like one bother count tvl chain

345474,
345475, profitable arb due spread
345476,ahh tweets twatted kwon make sense im familiar piece
345477,basically mechanism creating arb incentive also created slow burn obviously prevent arbs pushing price way correction
345478,spread big delay caused serious concern thus even dumping pegged token increasing spread
345479,laymens understanding maybe
345480,lot moving parts basic foundation relationship lunaust mint luna ust contraction burn luna ust expansion past 'basic' explanation going miss key points turn wall text

345507,lido's stake numerous node operators many dont relationships w outside participating lido lol
345508,also named governance attacks contract exploits

345768,new
345769,saying shorting btc asset less dollar every minute 
345770,recommending
345771,adoption graph going still undisputed market leader querying onchain data
345772,wait missing letter right 
345773,anyone else think lunaust thing massive consequences beyond bubble temporary market contagion regulators critics ever needed excuse mean even excuse shit like allowed grow billions even good faith argue even someone rather hostile regulation evidently failed self regulate despite relatively huge number people calling get go
345774,probably yes especially stablecoins
345775,yeah marketed stablecoin eg usd makes 10 times worse thats favorite angle already
345778,failed self regulate rather would self regulation look like
345779,like actually self regulate people rekt self regulation though
345780,good point seems impossible guess ideal scenario would collectively let grow point know thats never going happen incentives reasonable behavior
345781,chance ust saved everyone still staking big portion hold breath
345783,mean
345784,lot trust lost ofc
345785,basically crypto trust human greed
345786,selfregulation dead may scam play cards right profit
345787,want right make money
345788,recent iteration talk good vs bad projects that's dangerous
345789,self regulation looks like certification tags boxes products buy self regulation would look like best legit stablecoin players making review board assigning certifified non risky stably coin legit players consumers know holding problem would usdc right bet goodwill current best players let new players
345790,course force compliance order claim goes protect largely people like innocent retail market enable scammers
345791,know fiatcoin delete money whim furthest thing legit book
345792,actually government regulation also doenst save incidents enron lehman r lot examples
345793,certainly want kingmaker powers constitutes legitimate
345794,thats true think still absolutely going try invade space stuff like ust ponzi help
345795,withdraw withdraw thin air
345796,could pegged 01 fully collateralised
345797,
345798,made something quick
345799,full vid anyone wants
345801,didnt realise ever undisputed market leader niche reliant specific subgraphs slow clunky
345802,first thing sign lose 100% money put confirm money entirety disposable
345803,else except parsiq
345804,depends sort data
345805,bitquery google bigdata nansen dune etherscan api etc etc
345806,hmm meant like graph infrastructure designed ofcourse way smaller compared centralized options
345807,problem underlying indexer poorly architected least bsc usual copypasta everything eth second tx volumes grew imploded weight inefficiency fell hundreds thousands blocks behind
345809,maybe show already degenscore place gatekeep access innovative risky defi products sure whe'll love
345810,hmm makes sense wonder covalent better indexer
345811,
345814,well encouraging idk tho sad case sad everyone
345815,fiatcoin fiatcoin things also want bank know either said though
345817,
345818,
345819,
345820,basically says
345821,remedy coming
345822,lawmaster10s tweet likely true deal happening
345823,
345824,one
345825,live see another day maybe recover time vibes
345826,fair thats kinda grim
345827,strat absorb lowest prices try recover dust settles ok understood
345828,imho
345830,short ust returning peg burning slow limit much burned want able increase amount mintingburning allow faster mechanism

345832,
345833,burn converting luna
345835,like ust going eat luna
345836,wont luna burn 
345837,please stablecoin gods
345838,pacman luna ghost can't fight back
345839,
345840,faster mechanism apart crashing 0 one day
345841,think incorrect info moment tho
345842,lemme check
345843,dashboard working properlt
345844,yeah basically he's saying people want sell ust problem arbitrage mechanism slow making people want sell even increase speed mechanism reducing fear caused depeg basically people want sell luna holders take pain
345845,really nothing late doesnt magically create demand ust make system better dumb please correct
345846,even going anyone buyside books
345847,worked luna would dropped ust would kept peg better ust dropping low sub 25cents death spiral started
345848,believe want believe spent treasury yet basically saying let's flash crash maybe buy bottom
345849,probably little late
345850,isnt accurate analytics lagged
345851,try sqeeze little bit liquidity die hard followers big players exit fundamentally game ust reputation burned thats stablecoins feed even still personally believe thing regulatory risk high sane person use gg
345853,
345855,whilst branding anyone extended logo check beyone 
345856,
345857,aaaaaand done
345858,make dai v2
345859,1 let dump hard 2 try buy lowest possible 3 hope reserves enough 4 yes luna ust holders r rekt 5 manage buy majority stop bleeding return peg turn collateralized 6 likely expense luna 10 cents sold vcs stuff like
345860,first we'll increase speed luna drop second got nothing anyone else
345861,
345866,hi sers lunaust driven frenzied state mind still completely mistake though sent usdc usdt address kucoin ethereum address since compatible blockchain think recover funds back sorry inappropriate group looking info
345867,anyone got minting address watch flows
345868,wym minting address
345869,swaps native chain
345870,check usdc eth address showed otherwise going need contact kucoin recovery
345871,foundation address check much they're actually minting
345872,thats trouble
345873,chance ask support
345874,try emailing crying thats u
345875,dont radically increase rates motivate holdingstaking ust
345876,lol

345879,got trouble first place lmfao
345880,contact support im sure somewhere
345881,pretty sure pay fee get back assuming agree give back
345882,made right decision oof luna holders mega rekt forever
345883,yes
345884,luna never going recovr ust might
345885,ofc thats legit policy gov banks case currency devaluation
345886,currency devaluation classic sense word
345887,200m luna minted last two days
345888,hard say usdt hit 50cents point largest stable coin agree look good impossible get point crypto people forget honestly people's attention spans could next year
345889,yes where's address tho want see new mints
345890,sounds like dragging pretty historic experience give examples services issues verify problem still exists hunch
345891,compare usdt depegged due liquidity issues among uncertainty principle fully collateralized reply muh usdt conspiracies thx
345892,err i'm pretty sure there's one address minting
345893,yes sure dump addresses
345894,hell couple days
345895,want see mints best bet look mint transactions
345896,swap module literally cosmos module
345897,built right terracore
345898,magic way make less ponzi project obviously prone downward death spiral first days
345899,stop putting resources failed let die dont start bailing stuff deserve people always criticize existing system
345900,though let everyone wants leave ust leave luna close 0 ensures project survives reduce retarded apy anchor put cap gradually increased ust supply
345901,guys anyone redeemed ust luna manual
345902,imo fair high risk 20% fixed apy want less risk use overcollateralized least fraxlike stables
345903,think need take broader perspective things riskreward ponzi farm
345905,fully collateralized way forward
345906,reminds
345907,opinion whole lunaust thing net positive space done like time asking regulation simply bad ideas get called especially becomes undeniably evident bad ideas
345908,problem logic markert watches sees front runs shorts luna time voted luna already 0
345909,really need
345910,opinion luna way risky tvl regulation solution
345911,say anywhere regulation solution solution stuff like absolutely bring us closer getting regulated
345914,means stop putting resources stop
345915,response idea saving ust increasing apy ignoring fact would even work
345916,accomplished native wallet terra station see market swap section 
345917,two wys 1 ban luna way another 2 let people stablecoin builders learn trial error would choose second
345918,think net positive like byproduct defi freedom net positive
345919,agree w mt call hard regulations usually dumb regulations always mean dumb retarded boomers restrict everything like fuck
345920,also already market safety what's point turning crypto knockoff numba go
345921,except one talked regulation regulation bad doesnt mean save ust raising apy point
345922,
345923,bad ideas called even publicly twitter nobody listens lose money
345924,
345925,another casual 2 billy defend next ponzu
345926,speedrunning bear market innit
345929,
345930,thats biggest concern gets tether seriously looked people get nervous itll exponentially damaging since usdt completely integrated everything
345931,think ok collateral though
345932,
345933,think nyag case tether serious investigation
345934,lets pray
345935,understanding ny ag investigation never lead full thorough disclosure assets hand
345936, beef w frax sam always clear w comms id say careful well
345937,whats reserve % set frax days
345939,luna sell btc borrow usd
345940,furthest thing net positive considering every algo stablecoin damaged mention like literal scams money could've gone legitimate projects oftrepeated invest like pretty naive calling good ever tried calling something numba going walls make better conversation
345941,thanks
345943,lol
345944,thank rayne signature rayne steinberg
345945,lps locked managed normal users withdraw anytime
345947,there's still observable 12 block latency realtime told time entity operations sequential take around 30ms point still stands indexer fit purpose need realtime data fine casual queries use graph data trigger strategies onchain example timely information needed
345948,sure mean full thorough disclosure assets investigation looked books revealed time tether backed around 70cents plus debt sure they've gotten worse closed gap rumors tether insolvent think would found something damaging
345949,30 millisecond latency okay that's lot different first statement
345950,process entity block hundreds thousands sometimes
345951,theres 200 transactions multiple chain operations required unpack tx explains 12 block delay
345952,total delay around 30 seconds sometimes 1 minute
345953,yeah specific insights beyond rumors dont get wrong point purely gov starts investigating finds good something pretty deep trouble understanding theres really transparency much kind assets currently held ust nuking seems like big black swan
345956,owns liquidity though hundreds millions liquidity basically renting hoping stays around
345957,gm fam what's lfg latest plan print luna buy ust luna usdt ust
345958,many things happening i'm missing point
345959,let go zero pray
345960,happens luna goes ust price death spiral dynamics pretty much remains right incentive burn luna ust
345962,70% owned protocol even 30% withdrew sold curve pool peg cannot break wonders collateralization 
345963,
345965,sure problem bsc rpc's least hosted service streamingfast grant graph develop solution called firehose parallelises data input it'll roll production network later year overview solana breakpoint conference
345966,
345967,enough liquidity market confidence
345968,likely ust still massively peg luna approaching 0 way remaining liquidity luna enough fix also incentive people buy luna would like donation ust holders
345969,yeah that's thinking mechaism worked peg restored luna fell 90%
345970,problem there's one way get
345971,everyone ust tripping repeg
345972,mechanism works every version works luna gets rekt
345973,doesnt work
345974,depends prioritize peg luna lol
345975,ah get saying yeah luna rekt ust wont go back peg either think
345976,logically definition works includes price luna going ust demand increases opposite also hold
345977,luna die ust die
345978,principle entirely dissimilar maker printing cover missing dai black thursday
345979,always clear luna would potentially go 0 peg restore quickly enough
345980,difference automated vs able vote nope
345981,graph hosted service ethereum
345982,yeah doubt happens unless oft mentioned billionaire friends show even lots rekt
345983,luna dies reason ust live even peg restored
345984,yes
345985,one going pay anchor yields
345986,feeling seen creative solutions deployed yet
345987,algorithmically impossible luna recover unless get large cash bailout restore ust peg
345988,forks airdrops etc
345989,fdv luna less 2b 7b ust 045 cannot come back
345990,perfect time lfg buy ust add onto yield reserves

346034,explains constant 3pool imbalance
346035,that's tether
346036,maintain 3pool
346037,pool imbalance likely short term fluctuation larger orders filled equally reported prices probably using third party apis smoothing underlying assets prices calculations
346038,aka probably nothingburger caused volatility
346039,dont forget 3pool 1bsp going live like 2 days thats going help arbitrageurs

346157,eventually pick price ust eventually repegs
346160,trying understand month ago people praise luna much even ust could repeg pp still believe could dead anyone explain internal value whole thing speculation people including devs hardcore lunatics right like launched early days anyone pls let know things couldnt oversee
346161,worth chain actually pretty good block explorer diabolically bad there's really great documentation fast relatively cheap super centralised w 131 validators selected competing chains fewer rust makes things slightly complicated they've lot work integrate python
346162,better lot eth clones tech ok strategies deployed leave desired
346163,best feature flashloans
346164,isnt tendermint based chain
346165,yeah ibc tendermint
346166,enough justified fud 13 months ago mean someone literally bet 10 mio luna price
346167,good lord block explorer worst ever seen
346169,yea mean terra plan mint luna save ust first luna's price pick price eventually due internal value layer 1 relative ok ecosystem
346170,technically innovation terraust part protocol anyone able run tendermint chain 12 days middlesenior level dev ops guy huge requirements validators validators pbft consensus participants
346172,prefer anul
346173,huh makes sense first delve tendermint based chain i'll look similarities osmosis
346174,afaik built top cosmos sdk
346175,yes
346176,yes anyone many could build many fans ecosystem around like terra like good product need good marketing relatively average product good marketing could work
346177,lunatics army strong enough hold luna 001
346178,shitcoin like doge shiba still hold proving strong community could hold token without much utility
346179,argument shiba internal value still hasnt dead market panic luna
346180,bad stablecoin design hardcoded death spiral attack
346181,case ust couldnt repeg yes
346182,plan minting luna able save ust
346183,need billions usdtusdc asap save anything related mintsburns lunaust doesnt work anymore money gone already

346254,got addresses holding nfts eth locked staking see pic
346256,since definitely valuable right actually rug entire assets terra
346257,theres steth anchor
346258,afaik issue trying 51% attack need lock luna time
346259,attack fails stuck locked luna
346260,21 day unbonding period afaik
346261,yea probbably hedge funds
346262,believe many unstaking funds end 21 days total amount staked much lesser luna

346307,issue defisaver's automation there's less incentive stay sp becomes weak happens sp runs funds bad debt might wrong thoughts
346308,yo guys
346309,gas wise usually cheaper multiple require statements instead big require multiple right
346310,big require cheaper
346311,thanks i'll double check tests anyway
346312,require essentially logic statement evaluation cheap revert logic expensive
346314,better one big statement
346315,happens stability pool empty liquidations occur stability pool empty system uses secondary liquidation mechanism called redistribution case system redistributes debt collateral liquidated troves existing troves redistribution debt collateral done proportion recipient trove's collateral amount 
346316,got makes sense thank 
346317,
346318,hi guys made anlysis past ribbon finance liquidity mining univ3 think kinda interesting like 1 guy made 20% rewards cleverly managing liquidity univ3 
346319,revert great analysis postlp mining ribbon well also discussions ct etc
346320,share link
346321,there's discussion zef dan rob abt pool2 uni v3 mining bad idea
346322,ye let try find

346325,yeah saw protocols unleveraged liquidity univ3 days
346326,
346327,old fud new fud
346330,sweet viz library use gifs
346331,thanks one 
346332,yeah thats good one also thought protocol actually gives away tokens small amount liquidity reality turned gained eth rewards dumped side pool
346333,corner internet praising terra suggest reconsider listen ser lot reasonable people expressing concerns terra months think became scared touch reading crv's risk assessment team report
346334,
346335,3 man team raise 2m list holy 
346337,yo de fuk happening w curve

346342,there's bunch eth anchor polynya good tweets topic
346343,boomer stable de fuk going michwill sseereeer
346344,that's happen people understand use buy ust panic sell boomer stables lol
346345,where's defi education fund need
346346,ye seems like panic flee 3crv seems whole
346347,looked bytecode generated guess statement compiles evm equivalent bne revert multiple would result bne instructions less unexecuted revert instructions could potentially reduce code size slightly compiler naive bytecode reverts revert reasons gas cost essentially
346348,happens noone around bribe gauge

346351,idk last time checked apys anything fam

346354,btw anyone used fixed forex ib stable mim swapper fine works expected funny business
346355,think wrong ser take ust3crv pool example bribes 15% weight finally lose peg
346356,wanna check cannot open page 
346357,load ser
346358,internet ass idk website
346359,we'll keep chipping away something works reminds digital cash naysayers bitcoin bitcoin indeed possible many years invented novel combination several alreadyexisting inventions
346360,yes situation different stablecoins 'unknown unknown' territory bitcoin lot knowns
346362,true knowns found via experiments unknown
346363,looks like
346365,makes sense yet time odd thing attempt trying hedge away risk systems dollar side inflation cefi systems issue government instability crypto side instability crypto systems continues issue one perspective crypto extremely volatile relative usd another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto eventually line crossed people see usd volatile relative crypto likely onchain assets primary reference point point suddenly gone optimizing cryptobased risk needing optimize fiatbased risk really difficult balancing act strike properly
346366,honestly didnt need exact code figure thing besides actual revert instruction also returning error string logic far expensive booleans evaluations
346367,right happens side branch instruction
346368,syntactic sugar condition revertreason
346369,condition evaluates false execute expensive revert logic including string return etc
346370,code we're jumping nonzero cost terms size cache locality afaik jump instructions cost differing amounts gas based absolute value program counter incrementdecrement
346371,another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto we'll dead true beyond shillfluencer narratives even happen bigger things worry happen
346372,reasonable branch prediction started speculatively executing based assumption require sanity check revert even really lose cachepipeline except exceptional case point already going spend bunch extra resources processing revert
346373,well yes change come quickly unexpectedly current paradigm help 80 years mean cannot change extremely rapidly right would cause lot instability though
346374,yeah people gonna look ust say algosbad bad may could hardly design better trojan horse fiatcoins various glorified wrappers somehow top 10 3
346375,think even case nonreverts big require still cheaper jumpi costs 10 gas costs 3 gas like said specific example needed
346376,can't together one instruction though
346377,simple example 3 operands b c
346378,b false need c that's jumpi
346379,b c false still need jumpi
346380,fact wasting instructions lay like
346381,compiler generate code goes false exit else b false exit else b c false exit else revert
346382,saved nothing
346383,case save anything operands already loaded really sequence ands final check value
346384,would benefit short circuiting end
346385,suppose written words realized talking revert likely case checking bunch things true one revert case think right short circuiting leads us revert point cares whether wasted gas ands
346386,said see actual code know whether particular way better worse
346387,hey guys anyone knows api yields know vfat working version might take time public solution see scratch data manually wanted know something easier work
346388,hmm defilamma yields website sure exposed api

347445,
347448,omg creating stablecoins going longshort 5050 asset arthur's idea similar instead backing stablecoin pure bitcoin volatile undercollateralization risk price drops back stablecoin synthetic dollars created going longshort 5050 bitcoin stablecoin redeemed 1 bitcoin stable btc paired equal value short derivative contracts go opposite direction pricewise 
347449,someone build asap
347450,pays funding rate
347451,nevermind get pay sure simple lol
347452,think covered would sustainable fees would collected
347453,please build
347454,right let finish article opened earlier got 30%
347455,lol stablecoin tied volatile asset go wrong 
347456,least let's discussbrainstorm
347457,account slippage well
347458,that's effectively fiatcoin steps grow relevant size
347459,must introduce centralisation brings whole set issues design places inverse contracts trade sufficient size accommodate bitcoinbacked stablecoin service current ecosystem occur centralised exchanges cexs
347460,meh
347461,suggested stablecoin erc20 need use wrapped bitcoins like redeem bitcoins erc20 stablecoins
347462,check uxd protocol solana 
347463,go guys ask money back hopefully get nope 
347464, interesting take crypto stable coin based fiat
347465,oh sheit first time check website
347466,well given huge demand stablecoins feasible decentralize short derivative contracts business supporting stablecoins dydx offer start small grow
347467,like demand huge enough
347468,lol gota joke right
347470,
347471,dydx centralized
347472,claim decentralized eoy whether actually happens debate
347473,oh maybe thinking another platform
347474,starting small sure like hayes says small it'll remain unless access cexs
347475,yes slippage like 100% people redeem time last 10% can't get coz slippage collateral stable coupled derivatives terra part ii also overcollateralize
347476,luna pretty good bet
347477,end supply 6t mcap 100m lfg billion still luna holders likely get 
347478,think interesting asymmetric bet huge upside
347479,yeah put like 100 
347480,that's fortunes made still gamble course
347481,use covid dump example scenario
347482,smart fella
347483,price jumping 3 4k empty orderbook would able ensure stablecoin actually stable
347484,thinking might throw lunch money luna
347485,chain halted
347486,speculation
347488,delisting everywhere soon guess
347489,think major ones already delisted pairs
347490,still wormhole degens gotta degen
347491,protocol exposure share
347493,reminds bitconnect people speculated delisted every last exchange
347494,lol 
347495,legally people abused bug prosecuted
347496,
347497,good project horrible gov token sale think one worst tokenomics ever alameda backed 
347498,interesting spin chainlinkers though
347499,believe project using luna collateral proactive cant even take obvious decision like maybe didnt get information chainlink paused oracle
347500,maybes mention pause
347501,they're linking random tweet chinese even tag anyone
347502,thats case thats terrible signal sent chainlink
347503,seems mostly chainlink oversight anyone else's fault
347504,whole defi built oracle many use chainlink decide pause like
347505,yeah pretty strange borrowers probably even know going lol
347506,vaguely similar raiblocks exchange exploit 2017
347508,chainlink fucked guys sure communicated better
347509,forgot raiblocks damn meteoric rise meteoric fall
347510, 2 rebrands lol
347513,still missing word try
347515,guys think market going
347516,haha
347517,bear mkt till q2 2023
347518,math 570m total expense tech development 5000 people that's 100k per person per quarter caveats 1 expense goes salary 2 tech teams might less 5000
347519,based ghouls avatar clearly based avatar
347520,q2 q4 reason
347521,q6
347522,app website use follow portfolio value something desktop since boomer used use delta completely removed desktop support data synching
347523,haha
347525,rotki
347526,
347527,still folks coming space luckily
347528,thanks give try
347529,anyone insights stethcollateral ribbon covered call specifically regarding steth depeg
347531,think chainlink nodes fetching steth price source curve pool 
347532,even anything regarding ust everything delisted
347535,zapper zerion debank
347536,hey guys good token allocation research learn tokenomics design
347537,bankless recently published one
347538,redeem ren
347539,
347540,every single ones uses chainlink
347541,
347542,uxd lemma finance
347543,chainlink prob still largest single point failure
347544,ones solana placed major red flag chainlink could delist randomly zz
347545,problem strategy we're assuming funding rates always positive case
347546,tread carefully chainlink community dont deal well constructive criticism cant understand would trip circuit breaker multiple independent sources would reporting benefit said circuit breaker introduces pushing stale inaccurate data id understand relatively sources therefore circuit breaker trips outliers doesnt make much sense
347547,ser choice want launch protocol yes one minimum price weird thing idk reasoning stuff works well amantaya price deviations comparison maybe share cool research
347548,i'm seeing lot discussion around past present furure stablecoins particular decentralized ones tg discord group discussing precise topic would interested get involved looking protocol theorethical discussion around stablecoins
347552,
347553,chainlink price feeds price oracles sourcing data multiple venues reckon every defi protocol ethevms uses link oracles
347554,uxd kind fund accumulates negative funding rate uses pay funding rates positive
347555,circuit breaker literally price 010 design chainlink anyone implementing chainlink code know yeah detail that's easy gloss guess alternative breaker letting people get bad incorrect data something goes 999% short time period see motivation behind breaker protocols implementing chainlink check price breaker price halt trading freeze assumption something gone horribly wrong simply breaker would lead equally bad outcomes probably
347556,sooo much ctrlf back yam days even go look make actual report even dao sponsor research gib grant potentially
347557,problem lengthy bear market funding rates negative remain negative lemma understanding assumes funding rates favourably skewed long term
347558,wow ok quite motivetional might still already existing research group protocol chainindependent i'd simply join
347559,yield yearn stethreth almost 0 woulda thought there's lot action 
347560,switched new pool
347561,double checking dm lebed2045 legit
347562,convos chain independent covered yam esd dsd basis cash etc whatever new chat find wont would ctrlf anyway cause nobody wanna go explain design 10th time
347563,fireblocks best allows access web3 also enforce policy rules prevents exact situation described someone leaves
347564,legit asked stablecoins discussion send group address like lol wft dmd specificalyl avoid flooding main lobster group tldr thats need know stablecoins right
347565,respect everyone conditioned wary anyone dming firstunexpectedly dont think thats necessarily unexpected reaction dont think disrespect meant ofc didnt see actual message sent
347566,group better lobster big brains buying low see would happen usdn works model ust real adoption hence redemption oversupply could capped
347567,btw anyone stats winners luna game 11279958651 ust supply close backing joke printing period people entered game payed something 20% apr wasnt whole sum long time even excluding purely outofair printed part billions dollars assets sold get ust
347568,mind sending group address
347569,much borrowed well mine deposited 2000 luna may price around 5 borrowed 3500 ust rate 280% annually that's almost 10k subsidy loan
347570,good point assumption larger part luna aquired far lower ath prices people maxed loans swaping collaterisedfiat stablecoins winners theres publicallt avaliable dashboard data
347571,luna ust trading suspended 
347572,aaaaaand
347573,
347574,end
347575,hmm
347576,why'd drag adding loads extra decimals trading pair delist recovers 
347577,65 trillion newly printed luna wasnt end already observing realtime last days onefor lifetime event 
347578, 170b
347579,
347580,trading fees ofc
347581,yeah true idk point trying make still caused sooo many people get rekt
347582,pretty crappy
347583,yeah true actually
347584,stopped sooner surely people would rekt able cut losses
347585,well one could really cut losses much anyway
347586,get waaay people buy
347587,end 2 lol
347588,think delisted soon people would started blame binance interfering peg restoration nonsense know goes
347589,200m traded busd pair network finally shut
347591,shutdown restarted
347592,oh officially shutdown
347597,uxd
347599,gm sers could anyone showsent links recent pitch deck showcases especially recent protocols different l1s appreciate
347600,whatre good dextools competitors seeing lists tokens prices etc
347601,chartex dexguru
347602,dunno ivan block dragging personally find disgusting vcs shilling known scam even able say simple english word sorry shilled scam young desperate uninformed people sorry spamming imo community must get better speaking defi protocols must get better incorporating every junk token finger pointing chainlink
347604,well kinda says sorry 3ac didnt build money reputation giving guidance fair supportive shill aths shorting dumping moment always way think difference people make project gets 3ac investing means good pump project actually profit besides marketingpump probably doesnt matter mostly projects prefer big names pamp value provided shows imo distinction actually real results would come projects changing investors people hating zhu3ac doesnt change anything
347605,100% agree terraanchor heavily promoted new comers many newbie friends got burnt come back crypto time soon ever hurting hurt us whole ecosystem can't keep relaying guys little cancel culture good
347606,took money ust 6 days started depeg warning signs give credit algodtrading youtubers like coininsider made video called undeniable proof luna ust ponzi remember watching slowly seeing anchor protocol asset going thats took decision remove money
347607,people need research politician coming protect us well done vcs kwon pimping scam retail
347608,could much much attacker nice
347609,
347611,yeh
347612,ok stand corrected zhu's last tweet came 10min later say i'm sorry smol thing restores respect zhu person investor tho 
347613, kek
347615,well 2 ways seeing things 1 18 responsible action lose money fault 2the way see people knowledge majority dumb understand follow people eg su need protect whatsoever want advocate 1 personally people responsible free
347616,general population want lead
347617,need prophet whos role sacrificed things go wrong
347618,wont change
347619,think 2 open door regulations
347620,1 isnt scalable
347621,i'm libertarian also dealt people crying lost jobs clue they're supposed rekt offer job i'm also cancelling people investors influencers shilled young desperate kids got failed boomer economy little savings ust shamed space pretty imo that's us
347622,oh community ngl zu shu smart
347623,dont think completely reckless protocol anchor token luna problem way ahead
347624,think people young take kind decision natural outcome deliver license able invest
347625,ah u arguing ethics everyone chooses personally believe better open explain downsides dont caveat even know downsides still bet green bet red cause downside still wrong many parties bet knew downsides accepted moronic per se anyway regulation surely good idea always scam responsible stuff way choose friends wisely
347626,done convo circular sorry
347628,interesting pov seen many critics point real failure besides ponziesque tokenomics lack leadership team 
347629,ordered fix everything could fix peg coin mint like bro u read design
347630,working intended meant luna going 000000000000000000000000001
347631,luna binance gone 12 bucks lost
347632,bs job know designs though mostly shitposting funny know biggest ponzi design maybe misphrased
347633,dk tbh depends exactly request binance made bc sure design flawed point waited way long anyway could salvaged network halting early downwind reworking system design remember interesting proposition made early tuesday
347634,yup noted mostly surprised
347635,probably badly phrased summary courses action terra team could taken regardless design flaws hindsight probably would right move completely freeze luna mint mechanism became apparent peg could saved announced determine bad debt work raising funds put whole thing runoff letting protocol run course might defi thing certainly sensible move terms mitigating damage edit somewhat like 
347636,yup yup guys right
347637,agreed plus note maybe important part tweet even bother give response sure warroom modus ghosting binance probably best course action
347638,probably hard asnwer questions detailed plan save project
347639,lets fair luna 1 cent 140 delist firstly still listing busd perps aint protection either
347640,celsius pulled half billion dollars anchor protocol amid terra chaos link
347641,binances job protect people making dumb decisions reason ultimately acted playingfield eg deposits possible minting continued level anymore apart details follow reasoning timing regards ustluna perps spot pairs
347642,block research unable determine whether remaining funds withdrawn person direct knowledge situation said celsius funds left outstanding anchor protocol implying remaining 36000 eth 74 million also withdrawn remaining worth 0 idk
347643,anyone figured cointracker make eth weth thing
347644,says borrowed ust beth collateral they're okay provided bridged beth collateral network shutdown
347645,ye dont think job either also think ultimately good decision reasoning unneeded
347647, premine address mean context
347648,deleted
347649,premined btc oo
347651,sooo thats reason steth depeg theyre unwinding
347652,deleted new tweet without premined 
347653,that's probably deleted tweet premined btc makes sense lol
347654,hi i'm issues withdrawingswapping terra network since yesterday i'm using web extension ledger nano x get following error anyone encountered knowing fix
347655,chain halted
347656,im sorry
347657,restart yesterday
347658,halted
347659,ah aware thanks fast reply guys much appreciated
347660,asking fix though
347661,theres fix chain aint working
347662,terra restart soon
347663,yep that's clear
347664,people withdraw assets
347665,swap module however work
347666,people beth example terra able withdraw
347667,waiting majority soon
347668,im hearing yes limited functionality perhaps way remove collateral anchor
347669,exactly
347670,good
347671,clear path yet except
347672,there's swap module terra one
347673,meaning able swap assets
347674,withdraw
347675,mainly wormholelido assets
347676,dont swaps happen dex turn
347677,virtual amm designed handle minting burning luna terra stables dex per se
347678,guys ur taxs days i'm using cointracker kinda sucks
347679,koinly
347680,koinly
347681,ah swaps cw20 swaps work terraswpastroport
347682,clawmvp probably much speed effort point
347683,yeah
347684,u import work u cointracker tho u set eth weth thing
347685,know actually able check pretty soon
347686,lobsters hello everyone someone show sent links recent pitchdesk showcases especially interested latest protocols l1 including defi
347687,u set eth weth thing thing tax purposes wrapping disposal
347688,sure whole purpose wbtc wrap btc take loan without tax event
347689,terra
347690,trying hire researcher jobs boards interested
347691,samkazemian almost got 100s millions community lps rekt via 4pool simply lucky good rep amongst ogs one bad sign state space
347692,would also frax deepest liquidity pool people decide pool going zero would really threat protocol
347693,pretty sure
347694,usdt depegged think reason
347695,nope curious different projects explain fundraising goals tokenomics early pitch decks
347696,im talking upcoming happening obviously 4pool
347697,
347698,actually already explained telegram 4pool never intended used dramatically collateral frax terms peg would like worrying usdc's peg 4pool namely would irrelevant seems like concerned lps pool actual protocol's pegsolvency totally separate matter people see yield worth risk make informed decision launch integrations projects time long directly jeapordize peg frax see reason complain said obviously expect situation beyond disheartening see much people lost terra ecosystem terrible situation around frax though protocol stablecoin fine
347699,there's lot locked concentrated liquidity uni v3 also vast majority curve pool owned protocol amo rebalance shortly anyway make weights closer 5050 even weight peg basically exactly parity like said anything reckless protocol firmly owns vast majority stableswap lp collateral liquidity keep peg 
347700,believe frax long sam say ppls size size
347701,haha never know there's always bigger fish sea somewhere want build cool features amos frax really interested causing twitter drama 
347702,anyone building uxd eth
347703,l2
347704,really didnt expect situation didnt realize ustluna would one day go zero wouldnt expect happen short term 
347705,mean hopeful would able adopt frax model quickly enough get high collateral backing way peg robust unfortunately able time think fact everyone knows stablecoins need collateral one impression vanilla algo stable design make
347706,much 155b frax curve pool owned protocol
347707,23rds see real time stats amo page appfraxfinanceamos
347708,please share dummy guide frax works stable ust mean reading wp official materials understand frax backed % usdc % collateral ratio rest frax shares frax shares going 0 luna liquidations hedge
347709,23 pool 23 frax pool
347710,guess 23 pool
347711,23rds total supply lp tokens pull burn frax supply frax sold entire pool right
347712,anyway would nice talk simulations post would include worst case scenario case would dump 15b frax 2b pool instead 1b frax 3b pool described
347713,lot collateral lot locked liquidity locked liquiditypol means even fxs go price lot liquidity owned protocol also locked supply market that's try explicitely aim always designing algo supply mostly backed though tbh algo supply v small hope that's simple enough
347714,explain mean sure follow right there's 17b frax existence 900m curve pool there's tons locked liquidity uni v3 places well protocol owns 66% entire curve pool 900m frax even circulating
347715,dont issues frax protocol works way topic importantrelevant nitpicking since used far less transparent comms crypto feel level endorsement lunaust highly opportunistic crossed red line away integrityresponsibility particularly someone regarded expert matter
347716,thus aware many people follow blindly
347717,
347718,full history thread
347719,i'm sorry like said optimistic adopting fractional collateralized model frax runs worked historically like said work lot projects want integrate us make sure integrations existentially endanger peg case hear overall i'm also saddened what's happened 
347720,aussie tax scary
347721,well post says 25b frax existence 155 curve pool 1b sell order possible 3b pool 155 frax 155 3crv protocol owns 23 15b frax curve pool worst case scenario fudpanic 5b frax 5b 3crv withdrawn pool 2b pool 1b5b15b sell order
347722,
347723,that's worst case frax's design guys need imaginative
347724,yes another thing counting event nonpol liquidity withdrawn sold like amo would consistently burn frax keep balance pool within stableswap peg range factor 1500 remaining amount frax left sold minority left compared collateral protocol left hundreds millions locked liquidity uni v3 etc
347725,enlighten us
347726,btw i'm going head bit want discuss simulationsgame theory feel free dm i'll respond shortly 
347729,sure using super simplified example wouldnt hurt take worst case super simplified scenario anyway nitpicking nothing wrong post
347730,owe much money
347731,probably made big profits forgot put aside tax
347732,seems broke
347733,yep big tax obligation one year probably lost can't pay
347734,live australia
347735,there's constant storytelling it'll eventually get rid fiatcoin friends collateral ever actually gonna happen kicking road pacify bagholders anyone may say anything
347736,thought nice country
347737,model even viable first place makerdao gungho decentralized took black thursday toss aside veneer decentralization sorts weirdness comprise 40% backing
347738,mean issue properties collateral used might thats specific property protocol design interchangeable principle however agree practical terms theres nothing replace
347739,interchangeable
347742,well thats problem think agree needs collateral would good collateral bar fiat backed stablecoins
347743,tax constant reminder need move
347744,interchangeable principle would've started way there's difference 11 collateralized fiatcoin 11 collateralized eth there's also funny fine print coming progressively less liquidity goes far
347745,gambled away like 150mln per posts might tax evasion tactics dunno
347746,needing collateral disagree something markets aggressively like sort algorithmic design breakthrough little handglove favorite selection fiatcoins freezable brethren
347747,tbh almost every country profited 150 mill lost year later rekt
347750,deleted say
347751,claiming celsius might insolvent
347753,bridges work mean smart contract ethereum holding eth bridged terra know whether submitted bridge transactions terra eth valid transactions terra
347754,would detect terra 51% attacked malicious validators submitted invalid steal wrapped eth bridge back eth transactions terra
347755,arjunbhuptani pardon ping
347756,terraeth bridge built wormhole believe
347757,curious could actually first 2 even wanted go similar process compound minting bug 3 also terra anchor team
347758,currently check chain conditions bridging optimistic bridges check safety measures protect others currently
347759,yes theoretically invalid update produced terra could used unlock funds ethereum unlocked
347760, 
347761,i'm 100% certain conditions would take produce invalid update though
347762,cool that's i'm looking
347763,technically would hardfork chain main issue becomes wormhole would handle hardfork theory wormhole nonoptimistic bridges tend treat onchain data source truth would trust whatever came chain would come version truth specific nodes connected would report
347764,pretty sure putting governance vote locking people would cause recordtime race exit
347765,thanks lot ser

347836,
347837,aeth much cheaper compared steth
347838,think might wrong channel macro speculation 2 cents fed clearly indicated want kill demand fight inflation last inflation print 83 % still way high fed's powell said yesterday market needs feel pain equities still priced means rate hikes coming many estimates future hikes suspect 50bps next time sp500 tanked 3040 % unemployment rise they'll stop
347839,lobster macro speculation channel agree btw interesting see ecb italy spain can't stomach high rates like us suspect might see usd eur parity soon
347840,
347841,also ankreth 8% discount
347844,stuart claims usdx return peg algorithmic token like ust usdx ust ust system usdx anticipated go back peg stuart added back peg theyll cover value lost ust

347856,fail see difference
347857,1bps001%
347858,50bps big raise average
347860,rise 3% rate 05% means new rate 3015% difference math terms percent vs percentage points former relative base value latter absolute dont know explain sensibly
347861,
347862,50bps current economy expected rise 25bps bullish 75bps bearish
347863,understood abzv11 correctly good
347864,yea 05% 1005
347865,starting tweets based
347866,imo impact interest rates bad media would believe world's currencies depreciated signficantly usd foreign companies dollar denominated debt likely buy treasuries thus putting downward pressure rates
347867,delayed payment yield anchor right 
347868,vc leads round take funds others send one time 
347869,everyone pays sometimes also different methodscurrencies
347870,eg one investor bank wire usdc
347871,oh think

347974,yearn ust pools curve specific strategies ust afaik altho usdc dai exposure quite lot milkyklim
347975,mean yearn single side strategies lp certain pools none ust pool curve
347977,indeed curve lp shares ust mim 3crv
347979,yep correct
347980,
347981,safety scores nothing collateral liquidity based defisafety rating alone security contracts
347982,ust exposure known clearly communicated see fault many many protocols strategies wanting get yield higher went many consumer apps would say huge fault went many actors space validated pushed forward
347983,building product differentiate else could took leap faith
347984,sad tho 
347985,
347986,see though indeed joyceyyc
347987,exposure ust put stables back new year forgot dao voted march add ust exposure also decided give 30% portfolio means 2x leverage vault beef inaction peg broke pools drained
347988,stops place 10% depeg even usdt fine 10% maybe pull
347989,actually even sure agree anymore
347990,usdt 10% peg would exit strategy youd huge l
347991, exposure ust put stables back new year forgot dao voted march add ust exposure also decided give 30% portfolio means 2x leverage vault sounds normal new collateral onboarding new protocol unless done isolated risk similarsame consequences
347992,would great situation turned binary result eithe repeg lose 0% fail repeg lose 60%
347993,idk would personally done multisig clue would right solution
347994,probably pull 98% already drying idk
347995,point quantitative circuit breaker limit risk
347996,worth reading announcements discord last days
347997,
347998,would u pull hypothetical case
347999,usdt collateral backing
348000,seniorage shares 10% risk much
348001,welp think risk perspective dont know
348002,3crv moment 85% usdt bit scary
348003,sorry hypothesizing much
348004,biggest take away ust kwon suckered millions beleive solved seniorage shares problem
348005,wont argue ser
348006,think gro great idea complacent risk tried boost yield attract users exposing everyone ust
348007,confused though blaming team le dao voted
348008,also cream exposure first round pools
348009,messaging defisafety rating high didnt see algo ponzu
348010,everybody cream exposure
348011,cream hack different choosing metastable collateral backing
348012,trying protec saying one 100s got lured yes everyone idk
348013,leaving aside strategy better risk management could turned nonbinary outcome maximum loss loss
348014,quantitative stability analysis one biggest missing components industry right
348015,ive looked little people working post modern portfolio theory dont know details theyre sounds fascinating
348016,sure people voting look they're voting regardless marketing label says
348017,pull
348018,here's reality fun games week ago story different usdc andor usdt curve effectively deleted next 30 minutes
348019,dao pulled ust kwon started get cocky
348020,around 10mln saved
348021,yeah really unfortunate ever deal technical risk said earlier terra's products fairly well constructed terms audits bug bounties testing docs etc hence highish scores give anchor aperture never deal financial risk that's guys figure we're primarily looking products made indicators poor contract building quality rug potential figure whether want buy thing built that's far complicated contentious deal us swim lane stick
348022, maker gonna maple ask senior tranche type scenario collateral mpl
348023,read reports really good tech perspective
348024,say anchor good ust good
348025,ngl never expected collapse lost ust shekels due stupid trying arb
348026,anchor decent product tbh
348027,earn borrow
348028,beautiful ux good audits great repo number people tried sneak contracts must inconceivable fact took full ust breakdown testament devs behind economists much normie friends even used easy big part problem 
348029,well anchor earn big part card house built though
348030,yeah definitely set back adoption years back shit
348031,really enjoyed using mirror lot terra ecosystem dapps smooth
348032,worst thing terra kwon attitude
348033,great time dev build rn build low pressure environment moon bois complaining token mooned yet time things right without rushing fail blame bear market put dent resume coz good excuse still get job later
348034,can't build shit compain tho
348035,yes one complaining token prices best times
348037,every project raised money last year every ecosystem grant programs many made money angel invest usecases actual businesses really good products
348038,seems like independent financial risk scoring system big gap missing factors good coin huge scam ponzi need holistic approach else feels much like enron madoff supposed better rant

348080,might've caught users transaction details displayed eg common functions unfortunate reality lot hardware wallets wallet appsextensions really suck
348081,take ledger example tiny ass screen even display transaction data default tells enable blind signing though also choose display tx data
348082,lmfao keep mind agenda happens narrative currently playing
348083,iirc even display eip712 params get hash whatever connected ledger sign that's nano x limited nano trezor one
348084,yup
348085,cant load abi contract
348086,cant unable
348087,vaguely remember metamask trying parse display txdata also really working networks idk tho cuz longer really use metamask
348088,yeah guess it'll take ton storage there's much embedded devices
348089,
348090,dont care
348091,ledger using fact build walled garden trezor well worst hardware wallet use ethereum
348092,gotta catch earlier
348093,really trezor guess least display signing eip712 messages example
348094,ironically metamask could mitigate phishing database
348095,dns query see site recently updated could add banner unlikely
348096,require use webfrontend
348097,force update firmware
348098,yeah sure i'm saying would apply everywhere well rely every project monitoring sites etc really bet happening
348100,ah yeah trezor connect right
348101,always use trezorlib eg frame
348104,yes compile specific version walleteth get access
348105,
348106,probably able talk trezor directly browser webusb similar might need protobuf definitions communication
348107,sometimes change
348108,aka wanting implicitly expose legally
348109,
348110,gro always shit show starting w token launch

348113,much work qq
348114,
348115,sent like 10 times alread
348116,probably market volatility come people feel crypto lending platforms celsius nexo ledn blockfi etc current market condition platforms okay far work exist 2017 low risk way continue earn yield perhaps focus capital preservation yield moment
348118,think need planning volatility
348119,plus celsius killer bitcoin farming gig
348120,i've celsius since beginning pulled assets week years sadly american i'll never able use earn side anymore custody market volatility i'm going sit funds see happens yield generation products
348121,
348122,good thing lot vcs plug holes ever
348123,chart every token every major dex code tools recommendations edit yes chart ui tradingview thats easy part get token lists coingecko api wanted find new unlisted tokens find every token pair first dexs perhaps use graphql subgraph better methods tools edit mentioned deploy uni v2 subgraph evms interest pricediscovery sounds like good start
348126,dex tools coin gecko
348127,mean chain analysis code level include eg discovery pairs
348128,unlikely find someone willing share code takes lot time effort build refine everything mention commercial products

348142,10 eth consulting fees pls
348143,knows whats plan frax
348144,also go route know uniswap v2 subgraph bunch bugs might impact use case want complex stuff like calculating cost basis user trades gonna cause problems
348145,workaroundslinks worth mentioning

348228,create buy pressure dai downside
348229,dai could depeg wout cdp underwater though
348230,i'm thinking create something akin maker particular token could maximize guarantee peg seems maker's size widespread use play role ie enough cdp users would jump chance repay debt discount bootstrapping new protocol much trickier proposition
348231,rai problem talking launched enough rai supply created cdps market forcesdebt issuers liquidators naturally take especially eth goes wish chart demonstrate mechanism works quite well
348232,course bootstrap initial supply rai gave rewards encourage minting think maker altruistic eth whales since new idea time

348288,dexguru
348289,calculating cost basis handled frontend uniswap least use subgraph doesnt necessary gas pricing information 
348290,also use method called id technique described last example 
348291,performant base queries attribute filter attribute
348292,dont want use graphql example using mongodb rpc 
348293,use blocknative
348294, 
348295,ultimately ways trash
348296,gonna use geth erigon use graphql api schema rpc subgraph rhe db directly much performant handle higher load
348297,invariably want queries indexed wont change ur setup
348298,facepalm cringe never post anything job twitter account drunk mates
348299,someone know many signatures message needs transmitted wormhole bridge 19 guardians multisig member threshold message acceptance never seem mention threshold docs

348319,u right tho new stuff
348320,much rai team need bootstrap
348321,rewards enough
348322,much new tbh mostly spinning wheels bunch ideas old less old article 
348323,working designed problem working designed mutually exclusive staying insert high price long great bought high price
348325,theyre tantalizing close touching really good ideas revest playing havent quite made crucial leap logic thats needed really useful system sounds like olympus fnfts
348326,
348327,lol
348328,what's spread exactly ie much ld within 001%
348329,spread usually difference bidask
348330,ya duh k ty
348331,omfg independently spent like 2 weeks retooling uniswap subgraph calculate cost basis
348332,never knew calcs front end
348333,cost basis calcs
348334,want know opinions use browsing browser many extensions like ublock origin https everywhere others required privacy badger ghostery decentraleyes many unrelated privacysafety ones ofc extension apart metamask one defi concern somehow one compromised devs may get surprise wrong
348335,using hardware wallet
348336,hot cold ones irrelevant say extension x redirects background curvefi totallylegitcurvefi
348337,avoiding software wallets protection measure
348338,avoid supply chain attacks read 
348339,loading site different phase signing transaction
348340,concerns loading site phase
348341,im aware
348342,thanks link i'm also aware check contracts i'm signing i'm asking i'm overparanoid possibility mainstream extensions funny things
348343,theyre allowed screw doesnt rule phishing attacks
348344,imagine malicious extension pops box looks like metamask sends tx hw walletr
348345,
348346,wanna really safe chrome profile metamask ublock origin installed thats
348347,yeah imagine know i'm realistic imagining
348348,using software wallet app computer technically steal keys
348349,even ublock origin installed see curve guys insisting adblockers reevaluate
348350,always adblock
348351,malicious extensions usually resold
348352,might extension shows coupons eshopping sites gets really popular author sells evil north koreans
348353,thats malicious extensions happen
348354,presented topic mainstream extensions getting somehow exploited devs
348355,best bet use browser autoupdate extensions
348356,installing dancing monkey extensions 
348357,good point
348360,meh neutral good seems bs shillers

348367,privacy badger ghostery redundant already ublock origin mean better
348368,given privacy chat worth checking using year quite good
348369,
348370,last tweets vitalik really trying recreate communism
348371,
348372,idk like lot idk
348373,get whales creating 1000 wallets 1999999 ust also encourage antiprivacyonchain privacyonchain socialized losses impossible
348374,design way requires people ust depeg event problem would figuring overcompensate people sold loss depeg
348375,case would probably work future people game especially becomes policy even trend
348376,also something said tweet explicitly trying remove personal accountability small holders removing personal accountability probably best way ensure stay small holders life
348377,doubt also socialised losses wont paid people also lost prioritization certain parties within resolving bad debt ust created
348378,tankie rhetorics getting popular ct good sign
348379,argument knew getting applies way small holders whales argue whales likely know getting
348380,two words ladies gentlemen two words fix situations investor accreditation
348382,actually look little communism anything like different strategies distributing remaining funds
348384,would need see accreditation papers allowing discuss finance young man
348385,semantics point trying make political argument anything like treating classes users differently based much money wrong either direction easily gamed leads inefficient incentive structures imo distribute exactly evenly future otherwise people game system demand doxxing onchain become accustomed bailed things people building crypto explicitly avoid
348386,point discussing guys making huge leaps sense keep libertarian meme circle jerk likely become reality communism 
348389,quite lot sense message right summarizes everything
348390,u like quadratic voting probably since soon announce people make wallets becomes pointless
348391,really makes bunch assumptions potential implementation distribution even debating
348392,15m 800k get less back ayoo nah fuck
348393,either way fastest way get things dont want space cheering retail getting rekt vitalik understands
348394,vitalik also suggested lido fuck depositors lido grows much leave maybe misunderstood meant also communism well lido wants eth decentralized cause makes eth valuable safe maybe bit better context still
348395,like way things currently 1 token 1 vote staking bonus applied sometimes comp emissions vote super close iirc good example well work entities either side issue weighing expertise well stake
348396,
348397,link tweet
348398,
348399,ah yeah dont mind concerned silly things keeping network sufficiently decentralized saying good solution also acknowledges controversial
348400,note 
348401,yeye exactly page
348402,andre less resistance
348403,also favor kind refund mechanism proposed principle sometimes make concessions party fucked badly party public opinion regulators fuck blowing billions retail capital
348404,worldcoin fixes
348405,yes let scan retina
348406,
348408,spem fockers buy nft
348409,joke okay
348410,im sure everyone would consent anus wrinkle scan
348411,though would retail capital willing give profits
348412,
348413,would help restore confidence crypto regulatory agencies like sec designed protect regular retail folks selfregulate less interference agencies
348414,might good idea stablecoin founders form coalition association set standards selfregulate also come system insurance intervention protect other's pegs
348415,stablecoins definitely one top use cases emerged crypto
348416,would conservative protocols interested ie would maker want cover mim
348417,mim maker much lenient collateral requirements
348418,without strong stablecoin system btc go much btc price greatly propped highly liquid stablecoins trade
348419,even conservative protocols vulnerable many things go wrong
348420,thats really point acting way ensures crypto ideals would like see widely spread survive practice ideology whatever extreme form encounter resistance crushed majority people even get chance engage point want crypto blockchain exist isolated niche internet radical want actually want gain ground ideological political landscape need careful play reality majority people agree ideals get concern whole thing might get compromised process risk need tak
348421,kek feel free deradicalize see works
348422,feel free check history present movement failed either make work average joe slowly win get pushed back irrelevance
348423,disagree i'm massadoptionist idea crypto relevant everyone using something funny one
348424,r ppl still talking fountain present day
348425,far go get nirvana mass adoption really euphemism get pump numbas
348426,thats talking talking mass adoption ideals behind crypto tech sole purpose know stuff preach day dont want people agree
348427,ideals get people adopt keep shifting line back appease current fad
348428,agree believe binary thing middleground
348429,sure really kind contradicts whole idea individualism
348430,theory works playing field equal unstoppable force meets immovable object there's middle ground unstoppable force meeting pudding pudding gets crushed continues concede make excuses
348431,thats nonsense need baseline ideals people agree order kind functioning society shouldnt discussion times already going get solved
348432,different layers ser fundamental ideas derived evolution always stay ultimately yeah whole discussion meaningless
348433,shifted agreeing w coiner recently dont like either becoming turning mental 
348435,coiner dont lobs arent spam group

348446,there's every type ppl crypto vast majority get rich quick ones sides smart contract whole ideals thing play
348447,actually even conversion rate low people get introduced cryptos underlying ideals
348448,really funny i'll flying ryanair exclusively
348449,sent dm udi buying hfsp trademark pair ryanair socks xd
348450,underlying idea generate profit quickly ppl go back 8 years top coins stuff like world coin moon coin mega coin ideals decentralized fair money minority ideal crypto
348452,ideology ideology hustle culture 
348453,missing point absolute amount people getting exposed ideals choose people greedy tradtional context crypto come contract ideological stuff choice easy think amount people read bitcoin whitepaper even context shilling shitcoin got introduced notion radically revamping current financial system notions even exist minds ordinary people
348454,oh got haha mega based
348455,side hustle 20% apy smh famalam
348456,prob 001% crypto holders read today
348458,would say crypto's current ideals maybe i'm cynical current crypto precious little ideals anyone adopt compared similar alternative markets story literally keeps changing suit adoptees pump numbers
348459,hard pin decentralization trustlessness reduction entry barriers minimizing central authorities interlocking concepts ultimately freedom returning agency individual crypto potential introduce concepts larger audience currently concerned even join profit get exposure fully aware betrayed thousand times day profit definitely shines 
348460,regulatory arbitrage
348461,possible big unregulated honest question ever big protocol bow regulatory pressure crypto fringe market quickly evaporating

348484,hi going old luna threads what's role redacted cartel 4 pool
348485,
348486,voting pool money paid terra bribes see convo 
348487,talking frax team seems good place since collateralized algo 
348488,check latest tho sam wants radically change 
348489,say radically think people really took mean frax changing everything true making even safer still actually sustainable algorithmic supply frax frax right close 90% backed hard assets enough pol counted cr cover outstanding frax redemptions thing wanted add proposing algorithmic supply backed creditdebt addition fxs
348490,ah majority amoa stays credit cr ratio lets say 10%
348491,exactly think got intepretted seigniorage capture fxs totally new stablecoin really case we're trying improve model make something algostables aspire important know frax pretty much perfect peg since launch want get complacent think endgame design forever we're trying improve design algorithmic part supply additionally backed debt
348492,ah misread bad ser thx
348493,see pol total diff total profits bottom right impressive 12b 
348494,pol page yes example cr calculated much conservative manner cr curve amo calculated claims 3crv collateral protocol frax peg breaks cr means curve pool gets emptied frax 88 reality curve amo close 1 1 redemption frax sellers frax amo rebalances actually withstand 1 1 sell offs entire supply 3crv
348495,every amo extremely conservative way calculating cr see look source code onchain since open source frax 0 market operations chain deterministic
348496,another example lending amos similar dai's direct deposit module count cr overcollateralized maker
348497,thanks sam helps lot
348498,count lending amo cr 100% cr rather 150% cr correct way think frax minted places like aave backed 1 debt owed aave protocol 150% eth borrower used borrow frax
348499,cool pol bottom right chart
348500,yes bottom right profits still balance sheet see breakdown profits top left investor amo
348501,think way governance proposal written confused people going full 100% cr since done community member important know changing fractional algo model making safer keeping things essentially backed debtcredit
348502,also find breakdowns dune dashboard 
348503,farms frax apr restake apy otherwise auto compounded rewards ask tokens farms can't easily claim rewards users can't usually hold tokens afaik rebase like ohm one option auto compound curious frax might
348504,done analysis protocol profits since last week assume frax still one cash flow generating protocols entire defi space even lower 200m revenue yields think there's many protocols match frax's revenue generation weird see fxs hit hard market rn see dashboard average daily income protocol 317kday that's 115m annual revenue conditions extremely good shape excelling even markets
348505,coingecko api mean costtomovedownusd costtomoveupusd move much
348506,usually 2% im sure
348507,nice coincidentally going thru frax fei docs
348508,sure might directional market depth
348509,sad guys whats next cool team active dao saying anything token
348510,tokenomic design 
348511,ya frax still 37m positive earnings week amazing q profits fall half 12b happened frax supply ig multisig fully controls profits fund
348512,lunaust made curve wars ended
348513,btw profits 12b think mean frax supply 12b profits always 200m sitting around 115m lot technically lower
348514,yes profits held investor amos like vlcvx places yes treasury msig controlled fxs governance votes
348515,money market product increasing cr ratio right 
348516,like tradfi lingo yes think that's somewhat accurate think accurate say traditional fractional reserve bank illiquid debt fxs backing algorithmic supply frax aka liabilities bank
348517,oic grant total showed 12b accrued profits shows 40m see numbers refer thanks
348518,samkazemian fpi partial algoritmic new model cr 100%
348519,115 annualized case 4o accrued far guessing
348520,12b total supply frax little confusing show agree profits accumulated balance sheet 40m correctly pointed
348521,correct 
348522,fpi 100% cr new peg totally different stablecoin balance sheet 100% cr like frax started even conservative opinion fpi peg even harder keep dollar peg since pegged cpi thus inflation resistant
348523,current fpi cr indeed 100% right
348524, zeframl big pp
348525,wrong 1484b frax circ supply
348526,ya right front end clearly show 1485b frax dashboard 
348527,think main question arw trying understand backing 1484b supply godefi right
348528,acquired profits frax product generating
348529,cr ratio becomes 100% fxs token accrual value frax demand 
348530,hard assets like usdc deployed curve pool technically 3crv lp tokens specific lending amos also known overcollateralized loans pol uniswap amos etc
348531,12b related supply directly right q whatever exactly fell 24b 12b happened frax supply guess amos could raised cr try reduce supply idk fast works
348532,another product introduced ecosystem generate profits protocol
348533,means frax generating weeks billions
348534,everything collapsed hey still generating millions that's bottom sky limit products solutions introduced
348535,maybe highest day profit 105m
348536,indeed
348537,yes amazing frax still made 35m week
348538,frax also broken 
348539,actually regulate inflation fxs stake holders sure standing
348540,take break
348541,read 100 msgs let's talk spaces tonight
348542,curve falling depegging hard underlying collateral
348543,since like 80% literally stables via curve lp correct wrong cant fall
348544,gap algorithmicity exactly recent proposals sam wanna fix make durable
348545,extra sure
348546,damn like stuff lp fk anyway ask sam print stablez gearbox pools soooooon blz ser
348547,im notion undercollaterlized algo stablecoin realiable survive given finance impossible trinity
348548,correct there's enough pol satisfy outstanding frax entirely safe circulating supply earning good yield right obviously want say 100% safe due possible smart contract risks andor tether depegging unforeseen events assuming steady state things rock solid
348549,samkazemian imagination would happened frax would replace 3pool colateral 4pool colateral weeks ust died cr would going 0 fraximalists lucky ust die 4 pool launch
348550,also issue faced central banks generally fiat money difference backed army model also unsustainble takes longer break apart
348551,samkazemian blz get printer ready ser 
348552,1 read recently twitter nothing would love hear simple explanation honestly
348554,give us numbers breakdown balance sheet one hand 15b frax value numbers side
348555,fxs liquidity place think 09 approx cant fall id buyer tbh given usdt doesnt depeg real likely
348556,saw connect rwa regulation cr ratio 100% fxs value accrual frax minting
348557,mentioned earlier another chat frax community built ogs space made money make money rather solve real problems defi security risks always hands seen community ogs backing hacks happened tribe fuse pools seen single vcs influencer offering anything ust luna holders yet
348558,think asked answered seem like cr 100% proposal pass we'll keep current system place intended algorithmic supply backed fxs rwlprotocol credit loans still seigniorage component safer models
348559,wats cr atm
348560,sorry u answered earlier
348561,8875% cr moment
348562,see 
348563,rwlprotocol credit loans already implemented
348564,keep mind big portion liquidity locked
348565,probably introduce risk metrics based big unlocks could impact protocol stability
348566,around corner fraxlend got done audited trail bits past monday projects already reaching us apply credit
348567,rwl truefi lending amo goldfinch amo passed governance deployed come next 2 weeks well
348568,blz gearbox apply credit
348569,lunaust event sam nonstop ama 
348570,ping group get started early next week ser 
348571,haha
348572,answer one great ama
348573,balance sheet always live real time onchain read front end check amo tab 
348574,we'd want see frax supply fell nearly much % 12 fall pol aka profits aka frax backing supply pulled amo raise collateral ratio cr much
348575,frax supply decreasing due demand need look peg
348576,right decreased fast mechanism happen frax returned fxs cr goes interest rate
348577,need server like aws hentzer run snipper mev bot
348578,surely case algo stables monetary policy fixed function exchange rate therefore implication monetary policy autonomy taken equation means algo stables opposition theory
348580,understand correctly creditbacked proposal frax would something like elaborate lending amo essence
348581,latency
348582,
348583,problem diagram fixed exchange rate red herring
348584,want unit account something
348585,usd oil
348586,eth gas
348587,also definition fixed exchange rate cant free capital flow otherwise else enforce peg
348588,machine delay blocks machine
348589,yes blocks come orderly important able find opportunities sending
348590,amo buy burn frax profit falling reduce frax supply else could amo affected quick 13 fall frax supply 25b 15b amo 1 raise cr also current borrowers instantly liquidate cr rise affects future borrowers fast effect supply even current borrowers drop supply 13 fast especially much frax staked afaik 2 buy burn yes 3 lower cr opposite 4 raising fxs1559 burn rate profits cr
348591,pretty simple curve amos protocol burns frax periodically keep pool balanced deeply peg amo 1b tvl curve example 200m frax sold curve pool amo burn 200m frax thus 800m lp control afterwards lending amos like aave burns frax periodically raise interest rates get borrowers repay frax loans one main mechanisms cr gone week exactly designed 
348592, liquidation fees revshares 
348593,amo profits go vefxs holders remaining like cvx tokens curve amo stay balance sheet governed fxs holders yes basically profits market operations go vefxs yield treasury
348594,vefxs staking yield right 118% apr entirely generated profits token inflation 
348595,curve example specify tokens 1b tvl curve might ask partly better understand next part amo someone else sells 200m frax pool amo simultaneously burns 200m frax might mean amo burns different set frax tokens since longer holds 200m sent curve pool right original q amo get frax tokens burn first place aave example amo get frax burn ty
348596,curve amo operates frax3crv pool exposure usdc usdt dai collateral mixture 3 stablecoins currently tvl amos created predominantly 2 ways minting algorithmic frax supply protocol operates directing collateral used mint frax protocol curve amo example 1b tvl control frax3crv lp tokens owns combination minting algorithmic frax pool expansions moving usdc pool users minting frax lending amos like aave purely minted algorithmic frax like dai's direct deposit module
348597,
348598,dxy going usd printed obscene amounts
348599,theyre printed obsene amounts anymore
348600,well peg enforced change monetary policy capital control
348601,dxy relative strength index currencies printing us makes dollar stronger
348602,variety reasons everything simple print lower
348603,yeah dxy composition 60% eur followed 13% jpy doomed currencies complete scam
348604,watch guys videos interesting stuff 
348605,correct reasons
348606,samkazemian describe scenario curve pool balance
348609,tldr deflation comes first hyperinflation later
348610,currently assuming smart contract exploits tetherusdcdai depeg possible way cr 8875% protocol controls enough pol one 3 stablecoins permanently depegs though ya imbalanced additionally low enough cr curve pool could indeed unbalanced sell pressure frax large enough overwhelm protocol controlled liquidity that's frax conservative algorithmic supply cannot happen levels especially near 90% cr
348611,low enough cr see depends market condition's limitation burning speed
348614,cr ratio hard asset collateral protocol total supply frax independent market conditions levels fine cr 70s curve amo proportionally higher tvl ya could actual runs liquidity everyone saw ust barely pol curve enough btc liquidity model terra's btc collateral basically btcust curve pool controlled amo see would need 80% pol mixture stablecoinsbtc reliably stay safe think ever got 20% cr unfortunately far i'm aware maybe someone else better knowledgeable balance sheet could calculate highest cr
348615, bout3fiddy fair compare volumes last days given chunk volume probably people exiting entering usdt panic arbitrage lot ust pool shenanigans sure
348616,basically yes probably whats happening worth watch though rewatching
348617,thanks clarifying 1 200m frax sent pool burn 200m tokens sent pools normally means sold burned right gathered answer amos controlled large frax reserves minted received collateral past frax amos able later burn right 2 amos get minted frax minted borrowed frax needs go users deposit collateral way users deposit collateral given frax rewards amos use collateral mint frax control
348618,1 correct 2 frax minted lending amos even curve amo algorithmic frax supply similar dai mints dai thin air although that's kind extreme way put aave without cdps required generate
348619,wrong course definitely unfair compare volumes there's form level playing field guess going get bit interesting watch
348620,btw weird balanced yet
348621,maybe cause dai supply shrinking general
348623,well value quite high means rebalancing pool take time well values slow depegs also slow repegs
348624,'bonus slippage' one gets reduces increasing mean solutions problem
348625,simple public good stable coin pay fees profit accumulate collateral simple system eth backing fees reduced supersafe collateral ratio threshold like 1000% cheaper fees higher collateral ratio competitor public good stablecoin clear competitive edge also less risk factors governance centralized assets collateral higher collateral ratio transparent simple data health system
348626,need introduce incentive component add liquidity direction balances pool acts like amplification bonus slippage removing liquidity also helps want incentivise removing liquidity gameable aspects also mitigated something someone consider buidling
348627,lusd
348628,sai issue scaling meaningful level small user base potential
348629,much cr
348630,
348631,rune tweeted yesterday cant find tho
348632,point market participants prefer lower cr immutable contract grow infinity
348633,100m market cap supply thats guaranteed
348634,pretty useless even spend time thing
348635,organically grow long use always preferable available due higher cr
348636,someone refer example ethscan tx showing 'minted lending'
348637,system bound stay small dont scale cause collateral base small shrinks result much potential uses doesnt go anywhere
348638,way see scale slow least would centralized risks options since public good would need community effort succeed maybe daos projects would like toss money bragging rights lock collateral year without yield example would boost growth personally would mind slow properly done
348639,stablecoin adoption chickenegg issue low supplycap cant used much supply extra incentives without use case seems like ponzi subject fail use cases stablecoins 1 savings reason pay % inout cash deal crypto 2 international transactions including avoiding sanctions 3 trading token fixing profits 4 payment currency services products 5 trading token market cexes dexes pairsfutures
348640,check reserve protocol able deploy test different ideas like stable coins pretty easily
348641,ust fiasco dont think cexes gonna even closely look stablecoins ftx one best stables basket binance busd already switching usd many pairs
348642,people get lusd getting rekt gov custodial stables ponzi algo stables
348643,lot rtokens created probably popular point create easily

348646,yesyes bad stuff dont look small market cap
348647,already lel
348648,due pure decentralized nature incentives stay
348649,u guys suck

348655,never scale definition collateralized stablecoin always gimped collateral whether singular several best fiatcoin none decentralized that's entire premise algo stables break free inherent limitations collateralization vitalik's earlier comment algos actually trying put box things like dai ridiculous digress
348656,assuming constant eth price usage scale go infinity first stupid assumption knowing collateral lose value better case public good safety margin set arbitrarily high collateral provider trying find yield market would accept high cr
348657,pull lot shenanigans squeeze leeway look dai's collateral set nowadays compared preblack thursday frax matter well proposals tweaks gimped design remain added feature relatively trivial shutdown ways one lusd good decentralized stablecoin practically impossible shut scalable
348658,would idea less decentralized lusd one potential higher cr
348659,maybe didnt understand whole point remove shenanigans
348660,shenanigans way collateralized stable chance limited one collateral arguably dubious seeing they're highly correlated liquity's decentralization comes immutable there's gubernance cartel need bribe order get token acceptedtweak favorable parametersetc managed coin dai friends easy accepts limited eth pretty generous collateralization ratio 110% would need figure intend adding collateral
348661,well exactly proposed collateral collateral comes keeping fees system instead paying collateral providers

348681,need find good enough virtual gun
348683,first part comment
348684,math
348685,cannot scale collateral overcollateralized basic logic
348686,best par collateralization like fiatcoins still limited amount fiat backing fiatcoin basic logic
348689,1000% cr stablecoin can't scale 110 ethereum value 110 serving demand whats problem
348690,1x cannot scale means there's problem per se meh
348691,maximizing adoption trying enable public good people care max stability resilience decentralization
348692,current liquity
348693,would rather use liquity 150% cr
348694,account liquidation buffer possible price drops etc read model troves liquidated even cr 100% mistaken
348695,lets please end circular stuff tldr system growth potential leads low liquidity leads less stable system requires mechanisms place arb keep things sane leads nothing growth potential holds true actually normal companies markets less less want companies make 2% year company doesnt promise enough new stuff speculative premium talent flees company stagnates nothing cool death active ones everything cycle life poop regime boners economics never know top bottom least know assets always gonna moon anyway know company argument might correct given boomer shareholderpaying companies lets see live long enough

348714,u wanna rethink ameen
348715,better asking questions answering

348721,yeah ohm one came mind
348723,there's thing called rai
348724,basically stablecoin tells trade
348725,yeah reflexer also goes direction kind pegged value denominated dollars
348726,fixed 1 peg usd instead allows peg float sets rate automatically try balance market
348727,market price high demand supply rate goes negative market price low demand supply rates go positive
348728,novel idea i'll read thanks ameen

348730,yet float around 314 dollar denominated
348731,
348732,dollar denominated dollar pegged
348733,
348734,like force pulling rai back 314
348735,buy ohm want speculate ohm's reserve growth imo
348736,know treasury trade
348737,ohm 1 whole year 33 ponzi recently realizing backing meme
348738,great improvement imo
348739,u buy nft 
348740,ser unblock bitfalls please
348741,100 unblock fee plz 
348742,rai get internal pricing doubt chainlink since obviously exist launch
348743,picked 314rai start initially used univ3 twap price feed switching chain link cost reliability
348744,we're still looking ways improve oracle resiliency
348745,makes sense agree rai started 1 things happened redemption price dropping market would consider ahem failed stablecoin
348746,brilliant move set market expectations away 1 avoid failed stablecoin narrative
348747,
348748,well maybe
348749,314 people still think failed stablecoin lol
348750,understanding stablecoin number go yea ppl would think rai failed
348751,would argue possibility number go small price pay keeping collateral pristine worry much fragility peg
348752,see people included can't relate 314 straightforwardly 1 fact gone 314 303 obvious going use example 1 095 upside intentionally otherwise obvious downside obvious includes people really clued fact stablecoin
348753,know fiat currencies besides dollars stable
348754,always 11
348755,agree never fan hard pegs granted rai pegged
348756,end result break brains expand category stablecoins include autist money
348757,i'll take
348758,japanese yen mentally pegged us dollar 1 100 millions people's minds actually varies hugely
348759,1 129 today
348760,sgd
348761,also avoiding perception failed stablecoin trying prevent people getting rekt know one kind stablecoin 
348762,sgdhkd pegged usd fixed swap rates right
348763,mean yea sir costs 10 sure here's 10367 tokens people mental gymnastics payments terrible ux
348764,rebranding stablecoins 1 xyz bad marketing point
348765,nfts priced eth
348766,nfts 110 mcap stablecoins
348767,i'm curious though practical difference rebasing token setting aside whether believe ponziesque whatever tweaking example bit token demand token supply token trades target price rebase rate goes positive eventually disincentivize holding minting token token demand token supply token trades target price rebase rate goes negative eventually incentivize holding burning token supply there's significant flaw disincentives work far allowing price stay redemptiontarget price normal pretty similar
348768,rebase exactly controlled controller uses rates would mechanical difference
348769,rebasing annoying bc breaks lot interior stuff like theory could add negative rates dai reducing people's dai balances wallet yea that's kinda annoying
348770,suppose exactly actually changing people's wallet balances internal redemption price rai uses price debt eg determine much borrow get liquidated
348772,jfc like revisit 2016 nubits chat
348773,rai like nubits
348775,still understand decides stop changing redemption price settle new one
348776,algostable propaganda term
348777,market price redemption price interest rate settles back 0
348778,whatever redemption price new peg
348779,
348780,highly recommend watch video great job talking nonbiased way different stablecoins
348781,
348782,what's chad vitalik
348783,explanation behind slight frax depeg weekend
348784,reading correctly swap 2m eth 750k rai
348785,minted rai
348787,anyone know tried feels really obvious hindsight trying find eips proposed thing 
348788,different forking network specific recent block alchemy etc allow already trivial local node
348789,trivial local node yes metamask
348790,daily routine people living outside us tbh isnt bad ux rather something strengthens basic math skills
348791,
348792,talking metamask integration main problem solve would make events understandable people
348793,get wrong interesting problem solve
348794,yeah thats probably problem lot bigger scope
348795,protocols like uniswap barely emit enough events get
348796,also perfect security purposes since could still frontrun state change lot simulation actual execution
348797,sure ever solution understanding malicious contract's state change emit fake events misleading state transitions kinds crap figured would better exclude scope
348798,event based system might best paired separate reputation system sort imagine someone swaps uni pair toxic token sync event going come uniswap swap pair 1 transfer event going come toxic token 1 transfer event going come weth reputation system sort riskconfidence scores could applied based contract sourced event rabbit hole deepens
348799,
348800,grantee perspective say last funding round almost 50% donations failed due multiple ui bugs previous rounds great though issues like
348809,posted
348810,
348811,probably deleted retweeted due typo something
348812,also think many soon play enough real things defi
348813,
348814,framing around budget approvals seems problematic saw similar banklessdao projects costs roughly 10x compared commercial services results people overcharged mostly left new people experience showed fix problem bosses treasury held new team accountable prior overspend tightened controls ironically removing agency make fixes gitcoin full smart experienced people seems typical structuralcoordination issue wondering daos without kind problem could learn
348815,attacker seems done 1m bsc 300k eth contracts mess knows
348816,last round gitcoin product terrible every point view clunky breaks time stuff halfwork bugs everywhere since dao somehow switched dao governance social stuff completely neglected development idea develop decentralized grants 20 lost inside politics drama dao workgroups hope figure focus delivering single product solving world's problems
348817,food thought algo stable coin discussion anyone tried banging couple gans goals create break pegged token la 2019 article made noise 3 years ago roughly concept would create multi agent system similar enough open market blockchain environment useful spit lots training data gans attack ad infinitum cost function create stable peg much easier said done given size pot cost large algo stable failures ust think lab would tossing brains compute opportunity
348818,many long tails would project need resist would considered battle tested
348819,algos really worth anything soon one even talk think
348820,peoples memories short two years time new dude messiah complex claim he's invented perfect algo stable coin masses adore himher
348821,would depend reward function imagine would either get set agents collude better could reasonably expect set humans set agents never play algo ponzi
348822,would problem long tails novel data events would issue mostly post ask question better fully collateralized stavles provoke thought see whether anyone playing bespoke models chess ai 80's vs ml models alpha go et al seems like compute getting cheaper ml techniques also getting better quick enough make models robust basis cash 20
348823,ha smart bother playing ponzi 
348824,miss point want get simulations agent enough funds would buy lot ust put anchor start redeeming luna selling
348825,enough cause th edepeg event case ust dont need ml modeling see also 
348826,idea would also agents change setup algo stable gan side progressive rounds winner goes agents would compete build progressively robust protocols resistant bank runs depegging events
348827,protocols variables case hide seek game variables agent paths space protocol design much harder encode traectory decide protocol specifics constants using simulations like curve deduced stableswap invariant
348828,appreciate sharing level yet machines spit protocols tested agents
348829,i'm guessing projects heard maybe teams heavy ai background
348830,maybe teams also concluded algo stable coins useless reason
348831,fair point
348832,well
348833,that's purpose dao create shit chase money care vision
348837,total value ethereum deposit contract 20 reached alltime high 12588658 eth 266 billion 
348838,imagine theres bug lol
348839,nice
348841,rai sold stable stable float 1 314 pegged sort like ohm moved 4 1000 back 15 towards 1 backing want stable crypto special liquidity people buy stable mean stable 1 thats big use case want change mentality werent sure werent rai clear 314 isnt pegged fine fell
348842,univ3 oracle free price feed fetch rai
348843,lmao
348845,1 day glitch
348846,pegged specific usd value
348847,still stable relative usd
348848,want twap
348849,idk early launched v3 we'll revisit oracle decision
348850,well would anyone use rai crypto mainstream road
348851,ever heard inflation
348852,anyone looked kwon foundation see btc axax whatever leaving eg cex ie anyone investigated reddit claim 5 digits btc moving aka ran money
348853,heard stablecoins go illiquid cause nobody wanna use people issue tech
348854,tech diplomatic 
348855,u think u exit liquid staking withdrawals merge yet reality
348856,futanari type
348857,yes course value proposition rai fpi they're stable across borders offering sort dampened volatility makes lot predictable experimental projects go illiquid simply means failed
348858,rai supposed strength supposedly avoiding synth asset class unclear stable like dai mechanisms price target something people use dai cuz stable cuz floats like fly stings like crash
348859,that's point rai right floats quite like butterfly stings quite like crash
348860,stable market movements diminished effects rai price
348861,rai lacks value dai stable
348863,rai like dai target like wheel spokes round
348864,would assume that's rai represented index instead stablecoin get point
348866,live geopolitical area usd official currency usdpegcoins stable point view whereas something like rai would stableish everyone world
348867,dollar least worlds biggest currency priced many items online 314 isnt anything pi already broken pi still even tied 1 314
348868,see work rai's price band within 10% 314 usd rai relatively stable usd currency volatile usd experience volatility rai
348869,dollar world's biggest currency today century ago cryptocurrency even cradle
348870,fine another comes target dai
348871,ya random shitcoin didnt know stable probably isnt 42 answer life
348872,suppose cny becomes even bigger usd index rai would gravitate follow cny closer follows usd
348873,well changed whole definition dai supposed 11 usd pegcoin something retarget convenient
348874,detail mechanisms itd gravitate cny
348875,make another daicny
348876,i'm well versed enough matter go read website 
348877,course that's another token dai
348878,retract claim dont actually know youre talking
348879,yea pounds sterling
348880,i'm explaining value proposition rai specific mechanism achieve also imperfect understanding
348881,lesson daos spend military marketing
348882,
348883,
348884,youre explaining marketing material best
348885,what's difference marketing value proposition
348886,ohh care expand
348888,link questions dai rai
348889,questions literally answered nikolai
348890,thats marketing material lie let say diplomatically unsubstantiated unsubstantiated value proposition
348891,joke sambacha said pound sterlilng biggest currency dollar
348892,learn arabic 
348893,noise stability breaking pegs think usd stable
348894,everyone reads websites way
348895,marketing material true case challenged one succeed proving non pegged asset didnt even know stable magic spells xyz
348896,take seriously thing going end like grin
348897,fwiw still fixed pegged currencies world notably hong kong dollar
348898,iirc mechanism hong kong maintains free floating peg essentially like frax's curve amo works
348899,read
348900,hi eveybody bit invitation yo shill bags whats best way get exposure l2 narrative
348901,what's mean exposed narrative
348902,build dapp l2
348903,good answer obviously
348904,narrative becomes mainstream tokens related narrative pump make sure early exposure
348905,
348906,screamsh usdc vault empty 
348907,dei hardcoded 1 trading 77c think somebody emptied part scream
348908,yup
348909,
348910,float another one
348911,garethf cant hardcore oracle prices even makes user lives convenient many cases like
348912,borderline criminal yeah hardcoded backend see makes user's life easier fetch call covalent similar
348913,borderline criminal 
348914,way hardcoding fusd dei price 1 turn ugly mean could oversight criminally stupid
348915,oracle contracts backend server stuff user convenience referring lever stable stable kinda dont intend liquidated eth steth hardpeg probably idea make ltv better utilized consequences ones see 
348916,hong kong dollar peg maintained 3 banks government
348917,get hong kong dollars cash banks name minted gov
348918,get fixed peg bad reputation tbh
348919,need oracle hard peg know gif like really would mean oracle involved stablestable lending curious see contracts use 's compound fork afaik fusd ever peg since scream launched think
348920,wait wdym see
348923,
348924,foobar calling rob
348925,rob saying foobar dick
348926,afaik thread foobar dev work back days maybe people incident selling totally legal revest current team decided selling bad reallocated funds community multisig first time seeing distressed price project correct conclude
348929,ah yes seems
348930,bear mkt tings
348931,ye usual
348932,see ton
348933,safts changing lockups etc
348934,deploying unruggable vestings
348935,interesting keep eye projects less diversified treasury
348936,bump make sure timezone sees
348937,frax uses 88% cr 150% like dai what's tldr summary else doesdifferently 100% cr important thing frax well eg 12% 10088 faster growth somehow leveraged multiple 12% looked docs paragraph summary points would really valuable thanks
348938,tried poking around code 
348939,hoping
348940,100% algo stable anymore lowkey maker copy
348941,dai use eg 150% 100% edit what's mechanism frax work well 100% 100%
348942,whats question
348943,100% there's much left incentivize liquidators account sudden price movements
348944,100% what's mechanism offset problem
348945,liquidation
348946,redeem frax get usdc fxs
348947,updated q 
348948,guess 88% cr get 88c usdc 12c fxs per frax redeemed iirc
348949,zhongfu already responded 
348950,dai frax quite different work anyway can't quite compare crs directly
348951,correct
348952,ok right btw gets things depositing collateral borrower gets cases eg staking fxs frax locking fxs frax anything else mention top level summary mere mortals
348953,dai backed different assets backed usdc lower collateral ratio
348954,redeem 1 frax anyone hold directly frax website
348955,receive 088c 011x worth frax think theres small redemption fee iirc something half percent range
348956,dai requires minters hold assets vaults back dai gets minted value falls cr assets get liquidated frax takes appropriate amounts usdc fxs gives frax usdc fxs really way dai
348957,that's much understand cuz playing around much
348958,probably find frax eg staking stuff incentivizing liquidity docs tho
348959,able clarify 2nd paragraph it'd great
348960,uhhhhhh guess usdc fxs belongs protocol necessarily able get back ratio usdcfxs choose redeem frax later
348961,eg cr drops get less usdc fxs
348962, da
348963,oic well explained
348964,1 clarify one please 200m frax sold curve pool amo burn 200m frax 200m sold burned mean s1 different 200m burned 200m sent sold curve pool message 
348965,sers basics please find docs read sams messages ctrlf chat questions specific basic sorry flooding bit w normal things 
348966, 
348967,yup thanks much 
348968,np tbh find correct misconceptions important aspects product asking basic questions like backs frax first agreed pol aka grant total profit 12b mentioned screenshot said supply supply led good clarifications around q tokens sent simultaneously burned seems generally interesting spot docs fair enough moved q frax channel ty 
348969,fair open ended question channel seems broader appropriate would grow faster launched today time dai frax edit assuming know
348970,commented someone earlier generally stablecoins guess suffers demandsupply problem launched volatile week eth high ups downs price demonstrated ability keep peg range problem there's demand stablecoin also stress testing peg limited advantage low cap thus low circulating supply seen project coming forward trust float yet afaik
348971,imo answer question would likely speculative could say since need less per frax minted vs dai given amount capital able get frax could also say since frax concept less battletested since we're assuming situation launched users would skeptical knows
348972,could also say dai utilizes volatile collateral providing speculative use case stablecoin rather using stable amos
348973,good meant assuming know know they're relaunched whatever explanation patches scenario
348974,idk imo makes much sense asking discovered apples oranges today would people prefer maybe someone else better response question
348975,fair answer oranges vs apples might they'd like they've around long also analogy seems bit faulty stable coin q least math economic reasons work highlight strengths think market game theory liquidity etc think good exercise answers given far may best anyone that's ty
348976,point q anyone possibly thinking novel stablecoin mechanics consider aspects embrace dai frax
348978,gianksp congrats u wanna shill u need lobster dd
348979,mean
348981,buy nft join u shrimps
348982,u need hold shitty nft rights shill kind ser
348983,thanks answering politely
348984,ps dont force metamask connect user gets chance view page content feels malicious even
348985,thanks mean builder app nft marketplace visitor
348986,opened ur link main site immediately got prompt
348987,right fix right away
348988,can't launched today time conditions led launch frax dependent dai giving confidence stablecoin exist without completely centralized dai something else take place making new dai launched today completely redundant
348989,think saw wrote assuming know dai copy eth thoughtexperiment would 1st dai frax say marseth answers given already helpful 1 dai allows speculative collateral higher cr 2 frax holds stables lower cr print frax per collateral
348990,sorry much mental gymnastics masturbation
348991,would suggest move w convo seems inspire fugezi
348993,discussing concrete designs unless found ctrlf totally fine though
348994, np answer already given broke well wrt cr vs specualtivestable collateral
348996,thank
349002,asked yesterday asking anyone building uxd ethl2
349003,yes well mention example another pegless stable coins opinion serve better purpose crypto native currencies similar national currency keep stability relatively tight ratio sake international national trade interests whatever may main issues legless currencies 1 pmf 2 marketing example monetary policy macro forex sake pegratio would cnyusd becomes expensive become less competitive far international trade concerned interest keep within certain ratio usd dictates extent monetary policy crypto pegless stables reason besides arbitrary reduction volatility target specific pegrange none come good reason pmf one example pmf monetary policy theory crypto native currency would users would crypto natives drive demand external demand irrelevant reason wish hold lower volatility asset high beta negatively correlated asset bitcoin example kind reasoning behind monetary policy reasoning seen miss point find pmf opinion least

349013,also avax locked small amount liquid
349014,idiots system supposed work
349015,sure selling 50k btc otc efficient play saving peg surely well timed public market buys would greater effect
349016,stupid system
349017,could saved peg supported price much lower
349018,burned ust
349019,means huge incentive restore ust peg though
349020,nothing restore debt
349021,still around 1% current circulating supply low liquidity environment
349022,mathematical fact
349023,ah yes trading discretionary stablecoin
349024,anyway
349025,please dont rediscuss shit especially w arguments

349137,great video thank sharing
349138,welcome
349140,whats rwl sorry thanks
349141,need governance change fees add collaterals chagne parameters etc dont make governance include everyone one vote per person via sort proof humanity
349142,think need governance one collateral one fee automatically reduced high enouh cr parameters
349143,gotcha one loans arent free advertised pay fee borrow tx second liquidation way higher price whole project overcollaterisation gets lower 150% 191% right main thing ther business model liquidations ie users liqduates profit system questionable ethics imho
349144,makerdaos dai needs quite veriable paremeters interest borrow limied much borrow vs particular assets liquidation settings althoug quite basic maker system add new assets etc
349145,could also without cdp framework fees go collateral can't mint cr 400% example whole circulating stablecoin supply could redeemed immediately small governed version running ergo chain called sigmausd multisig governance used djed cardano centralized version model
349146,
349147,yikes
349148,yea got message apologized

349156,proven rumours maybe case soon find likely
349159,anyone knows erigonakula par geth realtime mempool data trying budget setting node
349160,context imo call dick us copy paste part right
349163,source 3 days ago
349164,want share feel free provide feedback believe worth sharing 
349165,still bad many ppl relocated crypto friendly tax regime
349166,legal ok kingdom legal fugazi couch warrios redacted
349167,plan assess tax stuff concrete dates topics discussed leftwing wants tax everything related crypto finance minister plans study evaluate new reality primeira dificuldade com que nos temos deparado provavelmente mesma dificuldade que sra deputada se depara para poder colocar com rigor este tema porque desde logo h uma definio universal sobre criptomoedas e criptoativos there's clear universal definition cryptoassets cryptocurrencies need overcome difficulty
349168,nothingburger
349169, didnt see posted starknets bridge launched anyone used built anything starknet yet immutablex dydx
349170,disclaimer forget starkware alpha centralized go yet
349171,timeline getting full launch bridge
349172,i'm sure roadmap looks like rn bridge mostly ready think l2 that's still alpha
349173,point would become clear boiling frogs wouldnt suddenly announce change surprise right
349174,bridge fairly simple safr comparatively actual crosschain bridges since leverages l2 messaging native starknet
349175,
349176,fully backed algorithm would make algo fiatcoin since entirely fiat reserves
349177,yep surprise changes surface one knows even deal problem taxation really incompetence ignorance joint together tldr alignment 1 lobby delay legislation 2 comes lobby soften blow 3 bet education pt crypto associations
349178,maybe incompetence maybe wouldnt wait around find anyways anything new discussed
349179,speaking objective manner anyone know underlying mechanics fusd seems like bad time rolling 
349180,blockminded
349182,wait
349183,snx early style design thought never go 03
349184,cloudflare launch ethereum validator nodes 
349185,lol ivangbi
349186,fucking rug stonk much ignoring
349187,cloudflare stonk
349190,net stonk
349191,oh man bad
349192, ye fuk
349193,smells like ipo stonk
349194,ytd tech stonks 80% net exception imo
349195,hmm sounds like got listed ftx
349196,turns microsoft google cloudflare investooors
349197,yeahrevenue growth 50% yoy opex crazyop income still big red
349198,probably better network cache layer rpcs already
349199,oh boy 
349200,like cloud flare can't close access net positive
349201,never really need close access things like
349202,let tor run free
349203,boiling frog slowly far useful letting find new home
349205,dyumyumy since u think ok share 100 twitter messages
349207,mute thats rude puke cheers
349208,ibc really level zk chart thought recent terra contagion scare brought left seeing compromised chain could forge invalid messages
349209,ibc would polkadot xcmrelay chain sit
349210,ibc right place
349211,ibc liq net part xcm rightmost dot
349212,mean xcmp think xcm message format xcmp vechicle
349213,correct i'm wrong
349214,yeah
349215,xcmp well hrmp right point shared security vs shared security
349216,one thing i'm sure xcm bridge
349217,think authentic way connecting ksm dot
349218,doest mean asset security downgraded ksm level
349219,eg ausd acala unified stablecoins kusd become ausd
349220,fusd live two years thing missing liquidations that's never peg 1 released fantom chain activity projects mention low mcap
349221,bank licensed government
349222,independent quote unquote
349223,think valid assumption
349224,wat
349225,already use cloudflare workers cache want
349226,rpc providers already aggressively cache certain requests
349227,
349229,yes sir ok
349231,
349232,
349233,hearing rumors frax trouble true place hear frax
349234,trouble far mechanism working contracting tvl
349235,kind trouble
349236,basically gonna reward holds ust 275 dont get tbh
349237,lp owners dont get dime 
349238,probably one worst takes ever seen reward people theory even rekt peg simply buy get rewarded plain stupidity
349239,275 launch
349240,tldr necromancy
349241,good bois crypto memory go along well
349242,sounds like pump plan
349243,sound like scooping ust trying airdrop new chain branded community chain tldr filling pockets
349244,go
349245,already bunch ust would assume might get bunch guise community owned chain hedge holdings pumps
349247,trying run ponzi shameless started shitting people 
349248,
349249,mb need entity wont influence protocols matter judge ponzipotential publish reports like cochrane biosciences crypto
349250,heh ever gotten argument people ponzis like i'll call ponzi realize problem
349251,yes choosing independent unaffiliated researchers report would trickiest part
349252,probably common question ever sync geth node stuck 99% complete hours terms block count 18hrs syncing idea takes hours days weeks complete ssd 16gb ram aws m5xl instance everything set right feel like im back 2018 nothing changed
349253,anyone using fluid finance
349255,deleting messages banning anyone using x admins checking mutual chats verify spamshilllarp legit u ser belongs lobster alpha chat u ser immunity gated chat 
349256,chain
349257, yep sussy semantics message
349266,eth
349267,mainnet
349268,stuck hours
349269,mean keeps progressing never fully catches wondering there's way get idea actually nearing completion currentblock good measure
349270,also stuck ages even though looks things happening using storage
349271,lots stale heal progress
349272,googled bunch everyone complains issues online lot googling dont actually anything moves forward
349273,parameters cli flags running geth
349274,remember ps auwx grep geth find
349275,long passed launching geth
349276,usrbingeth syncmode snap http httpapi personalethnetweb3txpool
349277,iops issue look like enough
349278,aws
349279, idea wtf t11s dropped ens
349280,issue long syncing
349281,roses red violets blue gonna get rugged kwon gonna get away
349282,coming full day 20 hrs completely terrible close finished state good10hrs way know actually getting close done
349283,
349284,fascinating cosmos always always late everything narrative perspective
349285,near
349286,saying anything bad fascinating narrative point
349287,definitely taking way long usually use snap sync usually checking rpc generally fine assessing status sure could wrong case i'll ask around peers spinning new geth nodes recently
349288,what's best place ask stuff challenge there's 100s questions online posting similar screenshots data seems responses maybe eventually figured
349289,nomura moved crypto think first bank trading defi coin desk reports believed interesting see causes others tradfi move really want create nom staked tokens yielding nomnom 
349290,there's eth irc channel freenode geth devs hang
349291,they've answered many questions past
349294,someone explain btw
349295,slack discord something 20 years ago
349296,personally prefer irc slack discord
349297,cpu usage io wait stats like seems node processing blocks verify state need wait
349299,get io wait stats
349300,iotop
349301,htop recall hand
349302,iotop
349303,oh unavailable guess that's aws
349304,would thought could using resources still processing
349305,maybe ill wake tomorrow itll done wish indication getting close
349306,ah look like geth cache expanded using 2g 16
349307,add cache10240 give 10gb
349308,leave 6gb rest system geth components
349309,believe default hundred mb
349310,node currently finished downloading latest snap continue trail 100 blocks finished converting snap expanded state trie that's healing values log lines seeing
349311,project builders interacted crypto focused vcs recommend 'good' ones help would appreciated sifting 
349312,sbi also already active space definitely first bank there's already handful switzerland alone maybe referring japan
349313,hi place report address stole whole wallet balance lps staked etc
349314,ive made huge mistake scammer pretending admin hop exchange using details photos etc
349315,scammer reached telegram report notoscam
349316,via discord
349317,guess could try speaking etherscan i'm pretty sure tag wallets larger exploits
349318,try contacting idk helps guys crystalblockchaincom mb try asking report address guess fits free consultation
349319,thanks try
349320,way humblebrag many offers feel free dm list let know ones xp
349321,updated works sure need post 100 threads online complaining issues
349322,seems like going hundred mb ram regardless though
349323,ah im starting see higher numbers cache could good
349327,heh well turned enough build wanted stick defi core principles we're thinking extra 2 solidity devs would allow us accomplish need lot faster want see offer good ones
349328,dm
349329,use erigon simple
349330,synced days
349331,article released incident good point arjuncrypto13 might want review
349332,lemma finance think
349333,disadvantages using
349334,way see change curve pool gauge weight % 100% vote certain amount vecrv would
349335,chart btw
349336,looks like parsec
349337,thanks
349338,yep thats parsec
349339,yeah still think ust trading way reasonable valuation implied airdrop
349340,think ust price even less
349341,yes think raange possible marketcap 1000000000 new luna tokens airdropped
349342,think 2 billion 4 billion marketcap
349343,80% confident within
349344,sooo marketcap 004 per ust new luna mcap 2b 08 per ust new luna mcap 4b
349345,buy curious hear others thoughts
349346,hmm isnt agoric
349347,guess changed name stablecoin 
349348,lol well whole world heard
349352,agoric chain
349353,yep
349354,hey sers anyone know people ask technical questions solana related stuff understanding there's specific stackexchange like one ethereumbtc
349355,idea there's platform use aside discord
349360,love new info text
349365,literality everyone try fud stable coins bs
349367,
349371,eth rarible dead foundation losing badly artists looksrare still fine farming rewards coinbase still launched must watch 2022 1 geniegem good working model zora nice website sol magic eden fraktal jumped late try gamefi work solana nft bigger eth nft opensea vs magic eden must watch 2022 2
349372,coinbase launched one cares thats lot hopium solana based one pump
349373,wonder rarible gain traction think first nft marketplace introduced token
349374,u missing sudoswap tho
349375,think site performant first missing features people wanted layoutwise
349377,ur missing nifty gateway think big piece rarible's misstep early community like managed attract much loweffort stuff partly consequence rarible v12 contracts setup 1 minter per type much opensea
349378,missing x2y2 well 05% fee killer feature 
349380,what's current definition interoperability feel word used loosely might misunderstanding something pardon people discuss 'multichain interoperability' 'crosschain interoperability mean evmcompatible bridging nonevm chains help smoothen smart contract code deployment chains
349381,discord
349382,used buzzword mostly would argue true intention interoperability native interaction back forth wrapped embedded via evm similar
349383,thought curious know protocol application already achieved 'native interaction' part even small bit even bridges yet notice native interaction tokens chains
349384,polkadot mostly think valid reason claim interop messages guaranteed passed along interpreted correctly one security model 
349385,cosmos zones talk 
349386,good take spree reason execution messages safe ibc
349387,one two reasons shared security yeah ability one chain understand message sent another completely unrelated chain pretty big deal like shared library subscribe indicate intention properly parse process specifc type message
349388,good thread topic 
349389,one main challenges interoperability indeed security said good assets transferred across chains inherently centralized validator base went typical 5 presale vc rounds launch i'd argue biggest hurdle interoperability necessarily make technically possible actually find two chains sufficiently decentralized security maintained
349390,goes crosschain bridges sure sufficiently trustless ones rely small set multisigners multipartycomputation minimum bridge i'd argue bridge using simple multisig inherently insecure
349391,guess many btc maxis hate concept wbtc ethereum
349392,i'm surprised atomic swaps yet replaced risky practice bridging proven work quite years afaik litecoin first demonstrate
349393,connext works similarly atomic swap think someone correct
349394,however pass message back forth still need trust bridge even bridge atomic swap ways reduce needed trust ultimately there's lot compromises make case
349395,excited prospects polkadot offer dare make judgment chain still nascent stage might see many attacks stress test future chain starts take
349396,i'm sure that's true production kusama canary network 200 referendums voted inout far polkadot far behind tech works tokens bridged things pretty stable needs users
349397,yup need decent wallet improve ux lots talented teams building really intriguing projects matter time til gains good traction imo
349398,insert chain needs good wallet lots talented teams building really great projects matter time gains traction
349399,must've seen 10 variations since 2018 point
349400,sure something essentially launched security two private presale rounds 30% founder allocation could ever achieve sufficient decentralization maybe i'm old school times changed fair launched leaderless networks adhere original bitcoin ethos become really scarce nowadays
349401,always wondered correct call interoperability crossshard communication even though shards heterogeneous
349402,sure technically correct would say
349403,talismanxyz wallet problem use case marketing problem
349404,havent tried expand use case problem dope projects like efinity bit country oak network pretty unique id argue valuable use cases
349405,thing bugs every app deployed across kusama dot user thats jarring experience
349406,eh sure efi rest yeah use case problem many chains trying find due lack users slowly converging feature set defeats purpose revolutionary things suffer severe lack marketing radar rest ecosystem like example dex chain done mangata makes sense gets rid mev else appeal eth able use dex lego without evm hard general public utilize dex moving tokens around friction clumsy still plus devs need start thinking aggressively async
349407,kusama try help recreate reallife scenarios real stress test users use network introduce many badgood actors congestion created different types applications tech works everything smooth chains problem even early days ethereum
349408,apps kusama polkadot determined launch peoples chain others launch vc chain get volume tvl others use kusama launchpad polkadot project
349409,doubt broke kusama twice
349410,great take people complain 100 parathreads think big deal
349411,definitely demand slots low right actually cheap get parachain going
349412,chains seem defaulting adding evm thing bit chainlevel pizzaz flavor cool talk trustlessly necessary yet
349413,really cool project zeitgeist chain level optimized futarchy prediction markets makes interestin governance experiment unless adds easy programmability going suffer attrition users lose interest markets lay barren augur could pull could specific chain requires bridging tokens sooner later converge ethlike shards chainlevel optimization kinda discouraging hope fix marketing part super cool stuff hard become aware
349414,havent seen definitely check
349415,sushiswap docs say 005% fee reward xsushi holders remaining portion trade fee paid goes pool called sushibar sushibar contract collects fees pools reward distribution command called sells fees turning sushi via sushiswap create two token mytoken mytokentwo create pair execute bunch trades sushi sell 005% distribute xsushi holders ethmytoken sushimytoken pair thus route sushi
349416,
349417,fact ceo offer anything reason enough go
349418,guys get good yield btcstable lps preferably ethereum bnb chain aggregator simple lping
349419,ideas dig deeper 
349420,updated frequently yields differ
349421,defilama also yield section days
349422,takes crypto especially defi bear pun intended rising interest rate markets 
349423,btc look curve badgerdao
349424,btcstable lp'd together single stable single btc mostly rekt yield least long run
349425,like btcusdc pair best yield curve trycrypto univ3 gamma arrakis guess
349427,tricrypto 15% pretty decent fantom good native yield il quite punitive curve tricrypto believe
349429, 
349430,media stupid he's ceo polygon
349431,badly already started get worse rising interest rates lower inflation yet recession 3 years minimum advise check understand almost assets banks businesses going 
349432,ellipsis bnb btcrenbtc pool think saw ren tweet long ago
349433,still wondering team behind ellipsis though sure spinoff curve related pancakeswap binance
349434,guys checked 
349435,curve arbitrum avax pretty good past days
349436,protocol leverage arb steth eth fully chain
349437,instadapp lite
349438,u probably lend overcoll aave wo leverage smaller size probably
349443,leveraged staking right can't arb trade
349445,ya guess theoretically u put u borrow aave defeats purpose leveraging instance imo
349446,sexy thread biased think missing fact composability goes beyond meaning aave love aave allows arb internal rates steth vs eth borrowinglending thats apy coming well gearbox goes outside system steth eth go lping curve depositing convex perhaps even tool earn apy composability
349447,ya u read whole 15 dumb tweets say 1 integration imagine u combining multiple protocols kind leverage
349448,hey guys anyone answer can't find one find pretty weird 
349449,exist knowledge everything hand
349450,even
349451,could see hand
349452,curios unfinished job pull data required lack arbitrary logic simulate whatifs
349453,basically could user presumably vecrv whale decide voting bribe given amount vecrv using pool farming
349454,btw someone builds i'll give grant
349455,guess easy need account players action
349456,well going depend quite lot data
349457,ah yes sure assuming else stays stable mean last moment others vote differently change gauge
349458,43m crv distributed weekly directed 390m voting vecrv look much votes given pool hard boost compare vs bribes
349459,bribes used 150% apy terra shenanigans 5075% apy rn bribes much lucrative boosting stables ethereum
349460,sidechains v2 pools decision nuanced since yield way higher start thinking using warden btw
349461,seen discussion insurance platforms allegedly could protect versus ust depeg work forgotten whole scope
349462,warden calculations moment limited curve eth mainchain though generally calculations tools guides come apy numbers example
349463,good question seems twap conditions met yet
349464,warden dapp building boost marketplace curve calculations done hand ape find platform look boosted yield directly curve interface base tapr max tapr look pricing enough dapp's simulation module bribe prices take previous round's bribes divide number votes got gives yield vecrv week need annualize small example frax paid 351000 fxs dividing number votes got end 004 vecrv voting favor rounds biweekly convex that's 002 week 104 year crv 143 that's 73% apr bribers last year
349465,unslashed worked processing claims polcy thresholds met afaik
349466,oef much marouaneh
349467,risk harbor worked unslashed processing claims insurace worked think nexus payouts
349468,1014k eth 22k eth apparently
349469,reading discord
349470,'worst case scenario'
349471,depends many people actually submit claims need process claims
349472,guess bullish insurance working intended even tough break capital providers
349473,taking place 
349474,actually much lower
349475,based pure estimates
349476,read mainbrain 05112022 spartan bucket shows around 22k eth two ust buckets id estimate around 1014k eth valid claims remaining purchased depeg event invalid claims guess u say accurate

349539,anybody know crypto lawyers chance i'm issue insuraceio regarding wanting pay ust depeg policy ust held nexo policy clearly states ust held custodians covered
349540,i'm surprised river0x earlier warned insuraceio part never pays claim much hidden clauses etc
349541,perfect ponzi cheffs kiss
349542,really i'll ask group see anybody attorney contacts thing think might save
349543,must insurance companies operate general
349544,would think working ecosystem change web2 incentives user experiences finding profit hedging ways complying due small letter
349545,really depends project lifecycle new ones might innovative ideas concepts even web3 it'll eventually come avoid impacting bottom line much possible insurance reason that's human nature
349546,yeap web3 insurance aligned correctly get bad reputation paying publicly token utilization must die i'd expect
349547,got daocommunity reputation core principles
349548,think we'll see implementations stability analysis defi near future mathematically calculate stabililty deterministic systems insurance ultimately far less guesswork
349549,hey everyone pm institutional defi space recent events made desiring help others attuned able understand assess risks leading write article framework personally use assess defi protocol risks smart contracts centralization perspective would love know perspectivesthoughts gauge opinions see there's anything i'm missing 
349550,perform stability analysis mechanical dynamic systems since everything math follows able perform one protocol formal verification
349551,barely formal verificate smart contract code would go stability analysis system can't even correctly define behaviour i'm depth

349790,
349791,agree tbh kwon scheming maybe force someone idk hard make people happy anyway trying make live perish immediately 10 generations
349792,terra doesnt enough money best way making new chain build
349793,
349794,keep calling attack whos attacker implies intention depegging rather blowing panic drive death spiral
349795,attack attack cares attack fragile systems fragile gonna fail one point another pure cope better accept result move
349796,kwon sold ust btc think reason big ust supply big cashout led depeg event
349797,what's wrong current chain besides luna price security depend price luna
349798,pretty cheap double spend
349800,btw reservers fixing ratio curve pools dumping shit ust usdc example managed 1b forgot happened
349801,yeah gonna die anyway retarded design think attack makes reasonable difference tbh means someone intentionally brought minimises responsibility degree also means theres substantial adversary
349802,yeah using funny money buy btc flood market supply attack anything
349803,usdn mechanism ust maybe usdn depeg event experiment attacking
349804,ivangbi
349805,understood network decentralized
349806,yes sasha closed door fighting
349807,wen usdd depeg
349808,never sir
349809,usdn ponzi knew ponzi
349810,usdn collateralized
349811,way
349812,sasha rugging vires finance lenders
349813,bit tricky imo example days upset john paul koning attacking usdt bags riding stablecoin fud wave legit signalling suspected fragility
349814,thinking nears usn bad
349822,please blabla bs mutes
349826,sharing keep pretending brainy chat defi 
349827,anyone know open source app uses private data built dapp
349829,new learner want understand private data stored used blockchain
349830,can't
349831,store private data offchain commit hash chain whoever shared verify authenticity
349832,thought implementation know
349833,around us minor forms example think ens i'm sure v2
349834,zero knowledge proofs looking
349835,past used able bid domain reveal bid auction ends could reveal bid seal
349836,okay check ens library built cool product tbh underappreciated
349837,curious project forking solidly eth
349838,nope existing forks polygon bsc optimism afaik could miss
349839,also fork launched yet think polygon fork starting coming hours
349840,axial avax dddx live hot minute
349841,evidenz publishes degrees private data blockchain understand hash offchain storage involved institution publishes data passes kind kyc address institution uses evidenz dapp encrypt data store chain tx shamir secret sharing shenanigans understand make owner data student control decrypt data sharingdeleting key
349842,yeah imo good forks dystopia tetu devs gud dev bilidly gud changes solidly good twitter optimism fork idk name deus team smart good dev also
349843,railgun applies wallet balance eth transactions become private people can't view
349844,different tornado
349845,use erc20 token amount like 7451 one tx still eth layer 1 interact smart contracts main differences
349846,anybody know there's way see exactly much coin liquidity pair able withdraw certain day
349847,oh interesting withdraw amount know tornado's nova supports arbitrary deposit withdrawal
349848,nova advise
349849,limited 1 eth per tx beta
349850,yes new though trade dex using railgun balance first dex integration comes next week
349851,could store encrypted data onchain decrypt onchain without revealing private key would use offchain solutions like oracles actually use data reupload results whatever privacyfocused chains though like secret network allow elements privacy built onchain stuff relying security tee expand definition blockchain wider decentralized system ways store data like putting encrypted secrets ipfsarweave also upcoming solutions using smpc projects like nillion zkp like aztec starknet's privacyfocused l3s
349852,cerenetwork basically ddc v2
349853,
349854,one step time naisu 
349859,chris blec could stopped he's mad

349913,ohhh tell us
349914,link shilling coz bear market exchanging knowledge problem solving
349915,soontm basically we're something similar elementswivelpendleapwine done taking step dropping clunkiness erc20 applying raristyle model unique pools allow interest claiming throughout lifecycle strip holder along giving couponstripping real use crypto beyond fixed interest rates
349916,whats data source index fetch site loads didnt really work mobile assume youre storing tonnes data either
349917,curious need
349918,trait sniper get fees providing affiliate fees atm
349919,actually came way short nft tokens something like nftx regular nfts
349921,50x leverage longed monkey drawings
349923,funny coz thought way short fungible tokens nftx much better price discovery accurately pricing nfts
349924,anybody know anybody francium sol updated farm prices hours i've tweeted response can't close short price wrong
349925,trait sniper others free paid tiers members generous free tiers provide direct links buy marketplaces assume get paid affiliate commissions paid tier either subscription based nfts access passes offered many dropping governance tokens well

349957,
349958,also good bankless episod back january topic
349961,zk snarks nothing ethereum proof system prove someone know something without revealing extra information something
349962,probably looking zkrollups zero knowledge proofs used construct proof bunch transactions executed offchain actually valid
349963,tornado cash helps anonymize sends uses zk
349965,firstmargincall please use google really trivial stuff redacted absolute low level rest ok

350087,ok thanks clarification legal language difficult nonnative us legal framework difficult understand think got gist
350088, guys wrote bullshit founders probably bit plebs idolize hate vcs either extremes
350089,cannot relate everyone saying people throwing money even bear yet pitch pretty hard new thing get fabled turn vcs away thing say accepting every offer still def filter muh vc offers
350090,token bruno suppose investors hunt token projects
350091,new venture one year time dumpflipwhatever still experiencing
350092,also breeze money per se hard shower dont think anybody money throwing weeks past maybe talking random anon emails offering 2m every day lmao
350093,also didnt say showering tho
350094,noob question regarding raises comes web3 project token equity share terms one offer vcs
350095,project question future revenue streams
350096,means u r likely public good
350097,new thing
350098,kinda yeah revenue streams service
350099,future revenue streams either token equity seeing problem depends
350100,maybe give us 100k we'll give 200k year something
350101,thats loan structure pretty scary make one founder early
350102,give equity that's sort point equity
350103,there's equity give understanding personally equity tokens nft dao
350104,dao constructed
350105,mean u vote right nfts tokens
350106,yeah i've bootstrapped personal funds thats's short term solution
350107,token standard could use replicate equity blockchain
350108,yeah 999 supply nft governance token
350109,well u sell
350110,
350111,sdk gamelike experiences deploys chain existing metaverse new one token economy around guilds daos provide service
350112,perfect first raise
350113,lol definitely spent many months mulling decision launch token experience token skews incentives community least beginning
350114,we'll likely one 6months product actually good
350115,nfts fine nice regulatory aspect
350116,recommend raising nfts represent equity pretty cool
350117,ye doesnt seem like issue sell bloody jpegs w voting rights maybe go jail like hope dont wagmi
350118,suppose would approach vc ask buy nft seems like nonvc territory
350119,wagmi s'all good
350120,well pitch nft pitch equity represented pretty novel could legs imo long team stays anon sec assassinate
350122,michael supposed use words equity token sentence blz like u lets go jail 
350125,yez
350126,nontransferable good plus added idea adding request transfer contract someone requests move token address x 65% voters support move go kind like social recovery nontransferables case wallet losses etc
350127,right think i've got lot thinking regarding tokenraise issue want disruptive public good additional pro features allow nft holders advantages actual utility token another question altogether doesnt really fit model we'll see side question assume bears good launching tokens
350128,lol i'm non anon ahhh
350129,eulerdao launching next month perfect time launch
350131,hugs
350132,
350133,sounds similar nucypher think theyre named keanu merging another project 
350134,would basically shift burden proof towards sec opposed say dont like something put pressure party highly interesting looks like crypto bubble picked ruling yet seems treated conservative vs liberal partisan issue twitter
350135,
350136,wtf
350137,work wirex makes revolut think work
350138,bigger start
350139,started changing maybe
350140,
350141,consolidated groups consolidated assets exceed consolidated liabilities
350142,actually ideal use case revest allow lock tokens nfts transferred turn without impacting price underlying asset coming significant system upgrades two additional audits would happy share want shoot dm
350143,good time launch advisors telling least wait 36 months things cool productmarket fit revenue streams fine need runway really worst possible time seeking money
350144,anyone recommendations dev shop specialises web 3 front ends 
350145,
350146,sounds similar way less user friendly pay network read data
350147,question carrier payment burden diff nucypher legit cool tech 
350148,anyone want take stab poll yield farm eul 20x leverage euler recursively borrow liquidation risks interesting answers far 
350149,dont recursively borrow 185 times doesnt help idk
350150,magicpoweredio
350151,well help farm eul tokens borrowing power 185 times higher would eg deposit 1k mint 185k position worth 195k deposits 185k debt simply deposited borrowed might able borrow 800 increased yield farming capacity like boss using efficient form recursive borrowing pro's compound smart contracts flash loans euler anyone single lowcast tx ui asset eul distribution
350152,yeah work guys they're frankly incredible nothing highest praise
350153,mean nonexistent case thing alive long time bit folded leverage even practical users imho ye mentally playing numbers sure
350154,feel like qi say obvious answer like 9 months sirens gonna go
350155,also true build leveraged longshort position correlated assets much way consider folding strategy ethsteth deposit 1k steth mint 5k eth swap 5k eth steth leveraged long steth short eth price movement less issue notwishtanding recent events still concerned time liquidation cost borrowing
350156,true assets correlated price stable coin lendingborrowing forex derivatives etc
350157,yeye ofc folding correlated assets higher tagging apeir99n oxmikko different approach gearbox dont fold internally system yield comes outside
350158,like question i've people message saying 'obviously x' x different every time
350159,lending protocols dont strength leveraged positions cause yield endogenous composability yield sourced outside
350160,prob less 9m due liquidation penaltybuffer
350161,answer prob less 6
350162,give example folding strategy makes use exogenous yield efficient way
350163,sure let's take example deposit 1k steth mint 5k eth swap 5k eth steth 2 actions addliquidity curve pool steth stecrv addliquidity stake covex stecrv staked convex position
350164,efficient leverage example effectively using staked convex position collateral eth short risk much higher since dealing protocols leverage
350165,kinda add risk even small yield
350166,liquidation conditions much less clear would argue derivatives made derivatives much less liquid costly close positions
350167,almost yield defi comes people paying premium either swap build leveraged position
350168,case convex allows unwrap position wo extra conditions add complexity adds small gas overhead
350169,eulermab evaluate risks 2 following events 1 unwrap convex position curve pool token 2 remove liquidity curve stecrv pool
350170,efficient collateral need put first step less u would kinds chain borrowing
350171,put 1 eth borrow 4 eth efficient putting 4 eth borrow 4 eth
350172,still understand oracles rating euler calculated wsteth pool costs manipulation 2 times bigger usdc pool 60 times less liquidity sorry probably stupid
350173,
350174,pretty cool still also puzzled works guess uniqueness v3 cool stuff 
350175,total liquidity really relevant widely distributed liquidity want manipulate twap need send spot price single block something millions % higher send price zero imagine order book usdcusdt 1m buy sells placed 099 101 1 peg swap 1m usdc 990k usdt i've lost small bit money slippage every 1 swap sends price straight zero order book empty cost manipulating oracle 10k imagine order book 1m buy orders spread evenly 001 002 003 liquidity different order book profile swap 1m usdc usdt i'm actually paying huge amount slippage going totally rekt moreover arbitrageurs use wide range liquidity arb price back immediately slippage cost higher arbitrage risk greater liquidity fullrange concentrated measure actual cost attack right use current liquidity profile uniswap pool simulate swaps using static calls smart contracts figure much would cost attacker move twap price 20% lot cases turns costs billions dollars

350321,however leads absolute realized losses holders meaning dgaf 100 dollars distributed
350322,would rather get 0 keep shitcoin alive small chance recovery get 100 bucks exit fair actually call rugger even distributed funds
350323,correct exactly happened europe term printing main difference money printed benefited us citizensentities 100% hold half usd circulation many countries using usd legal currency usd reserve currency still far main currency international exchanges means less impacted inflation whereas european hold 100% euros full impact that's us always get less impacted global crisis

350369,thanks sharing looks like fundametals would go well practical basic knowlage ive interviewed close 50 solidity developes still cant wrap head around little avarage smartcontract dev knows standard smartcontacts gotchas
350370,anyone got checklist successful token launch
350371,successful mean
350372,examples basic questions average sc dev could answer 
350373,think u buidler u start build something newpivoooooot u eventually token u keep bagholders mind airdrop sth thats probably best
350374,think u honestly say like idea thought would work work sorry guys try build something else keep u mind sensible ppl ok course u shilled ur coin uponly ppl pissed thats u like kwon
350375,maybe dont raise bazillion valuation peak bulla market pmf rush tokenise
350377,yea greedy ppl rightfully pissed
350378,think good example like weiward
350379,problem sort thinking confuses token holders users
350380,lots cases token holders users thats got token take ur point
350381,guys tried build something cool model quite work token though ppl got minirekt mechanism design like work sorry move
350382,true afaik times get token without ever using anything
350383,depends project
350384,complain users always fun one
350385,transfer vs safetransfer reentrancy attack got hear erc20 reentrancy bs often constants take slots storage call vs delegate call require vs assert private variables private weeks ago ive learn senior solidity 190ky race condition transaction execution etc etc
350386,suppose exceptions today retroactive airdrop fad wonder much exception maybe controversial arguably half token holders usage expect dump within first hour 30 days move next thing sybil
350387,true even web2 plenty companies loads users users without subsidies
350388,tokens direct way giving free money lol guess good projects find pmf get sticky users pmf u rekt tokens stop working
350389,compile medium post interesting stuff angle
350390,controversial truth people field want even acknowledge preferring instead keep babbling community wagmi etc
350391,giga brain put digestable format

350402,think really one big fields study web3 incentives engineering
350403,design tokenomics incentivize right behaviors
350404,airdrops particularly badly engineered one aweful way engaging community
350405,launched product spent time dealing people wanted get airdrop unlikely ever add value project
350406,find projects map eligibility past behavior still ways perfect interesting framework
350407,future behavioral economics
350408,true almost never give users shares entails subsidy good reason i'd say clear problems tokens ideally users tokenholders would overlap almost entirely case network tokens problem fit one project bunch token holders users working new one would wise consider asking tokenholders broughtwill bring table giving tokens lest repeat history
350409,5k tokenholders 50 users lot entitled noise future wen news admen waiting happen

350501,would faucet highest amount liquidty
350502,dev would pay 0000001 mainet eth 1 kovan eth something
350503,faucet fill
350504,great devs
350505,prob pita write bridge tho
350506,like 400 hrs work
350507,keep bug secret wait protocol get rich set bug bounty
350508,tbh may better service pay maintain testnet nodes testnet eth mined nodes distributed among sponsors
350509,risk someone else reporting bug
350510,one things realised recently defis even harder time getting new recruits ecosystem way marketing strategyteams structured assume growth marketing team great far growth product work goes best really arent lot brand part
350511,sadly normies run stories identities lot quality product
350512,larger scale projects need work better recruitment branding projects

350536,0x great tool 
350537,thanks bantg checking
350538,great start one thing missing there's way partial fill order got similar tools test
350539,supports partial fills remember right
350540,oh thanks guess didnt go far enough flow test need try taking test order
350541,
350546,went flow theres option partial fill

350559,hey thanks feedback sure lot metrics missing due accessibility constraints choose
350560,would added 34 yeah

350587,overcollateralized ltv 300% required boring
350588,interesting model seems andre learns something snx
350589,serious question actually want know answer guys uncollaterlized stables talk capital efficient actually mean retail buyer pay 1 1 worth stable theres capital efficiency correct capital efficient issuer aka nice able launch stable coin capital needed ever
350590,yes look seigniorage
350591,yeah get seigniorage trying figure im missing something actual capital efficiency sort benefit users basically uncollaterlized stable coins aweful everyone except people cashing printing every stable coin shilling capital efficient tricking people thinking actually helps
350592,ser that's strawman
350593,call entire point tricked blame
350594,capital efficiency lack thereof basic stuff like algorithmic stablecoins invented concept
350595,
350596,something tweeted video offers great deal information different stablecoins think lot people could benefit watching whole thing
350597,see eg recent hayes article stablecoins pay buyer really factor collateralization question
350598,fair enough besides straw man benefit users actively pitched capital efficiency
350599,benefit exists plane caused dai accept freezable collateral despite eth working well enough growth
350600,except non collateralised stables find easier increase supply therefore adoption
350601,thing stablecoin sell market supply nice pretend algo stablecoins care growing supply beyond confines theira single collateral pretense
350602,thread sam might interest 
350604,awesome yeah thats super helpful like frax fei seems like pretty good compromise growth nuking least bad later

350639,along way meet right people voila
350640,thing exhausting raising money looking job 
350641,entrepreneurs become serial entrepreneurs till theyre 5 yrs retiring point theyve either made millions enough success land cushy gig big consulting firm
350642, building also presenting project sdk new existing metaverses results actually decentralized gamelike environment lets experience downtime censorship resistant presenting pocs explanation building strong commitments really high profile individuals funds like wont close round saying seeing fabled showering money point time actually try vs legend keep throwing money us

350665,gnosissafeio ser
350666,change chain top right corner
350667,yep thanks
350668,listened podcast super cool stuff anyone thats interested 
350669,appreciate there's video version kraken's youtube
350670,
350671,wat
350672,tiring even reading anything anymore much drama bs let die prosper
350673,legacy stop using official deployment gnosissafe migration renewal possible dont seem know dont remember whether update manager something like mechanisms cuffed bad shitty deployed shorter cant updated official versions dont remember last year long time ago didnt know interface still working going turned departure main part users date set
350674,excuse automatically translate russian also fyi safefantomnetwork something like deployment official phantom suddenly would like know subdomain youve learned hope come handy 
350675,multi sigs launched via interface factory dead
350676, lol
350677,wont updated interface easy youd better move contracts happen whats sick theres bone 
350678,need able use gnosis mechanism think look admin mechanism something like defenderopenzeppelin nuance need take abi appropriate version etherscan gnosissafe address falling
350679,might useful andrey oz painted well details beautiful understandable illustrative examples use convenient long time one half even soon using couple years since release released launched time expensive sunfaced andre launched keepernetwork great thing 
350680,one threads mentions searchers shhh searchers going stop fucking around assembly realize use vyper soon term searcher refer ideas
350684,probably means people looking gas optimizations otherwise know used mev searchers
350685,yeah thinking flashbot searcher think care much gas optimizations
350686,profit margin depend 
350687,solver gnosis terminology minute ill couple links explain topic directly beautifully understood everything correctly
350688,example video 
350689,wp 
350690,cowfi worked gnosis protocol v2
350695,thing imo makes sense prediction markets clob pms also felt like solution search problem past 5 years
350697,also theyre immediately breach fin regs western countries even grey area sadly

350715,frens could anyone plz help currently listening block events via ethers js checking conditions block true send tx problem tx still pending condition stays true hence next block tx gets executed causing revert wasted gas looking find robust way pause listener tx executed continue mined could find anything ethers js docs 
350716,assume arbitrary settimeout going help things 
350717,usually wait next block listen
350718,loop blocknum lastblock
350719,doesnt really work testnet im always included block gets invoked work budle mainnet fo sure yh theres pause function block yh gosh dont wanna go go path 
350720,could explicitly listen tx
350721,easy way checking nonce
350722,guess also offchain logic sending exactly one message eg conditions met send tx set lock key stored redis shall multiple service instances boolean variable memory listening check blockchain conditions met lock taken lock removed tx suceeds

350832,issues relying tee vs storing private data ipfsarweave love understand privacy chains pitfalls would appreciate anyone could provide guides links read struggling understand technical stuff
350833,derivadex tee component worth exploring
350835,intel's trusted execution environment tee secure area cpu people prefer trust remote computation encrypted data tee hacked times exposing sensitive user data arweave storage arguably permanent encryption algorithm used store private data ever hacked private data could become accessible others ipfs native incentivisation layer people could stop storing document need pay trusted companies pin document
350836,
350837,tee hacked would data breach isolated cpu would seem like arweave way dangerous since encryption algo universal data stored algorithm figured data exposed that's case what's reasoning choosing tee vs arweave
350839,new shit come light hope evidence coming
350842,waiting facts gibberish
350843,isnt true encryption algorithm ie aes ever hacked screwed

350853,sure making comparison two tbh tee used computation data secure environment ipfsarweave used data storage tbh best bet probably never store private data public includes gmail dropbox facebook etc people still there's argument privately encrypting locally uploading would secure trusting 3rd party like icloud data samueldare mentions encryption algorithm gets broken could put blockchain security banks etc risk regarding ipfsarweave dangerous believe majority data stored would unencrypted data fit public consumption

351010,whether speculative tokens nfts least somewhat understand businesses like poap funding revenue rainbow wallet another 100 wallets industry based grants sort external funding mechanism mean eventually see products die hope metamask revenue moments
351011,lot industry start grants ecosystems lots money incentivized throw much possible community build granted projects never get completed operationalize allow people explore new use cases
351012,grants programs poorly managed sheer number applicants
351013,1 web3 business poor cash flow revenue companies web3 index revenue baffles tbh 
351014,said lot public goods still need built allow sustainable community development

351040,sustainable
351041,rugpulls grant driven startups also make lot money
351042,ultimately kick starting ecosystem grant funding fundamentally unsustainable thing ecosystem requires certain process well certain flow resources become self sustaining thats grants trying get community reach critical mass

351316,lol really hope many people believe eventual profitability extremely important successful businesses uber chose unprofitable grow faster strategic decision
351317,exits require large revenue
351318,uber hardly exception 
351319,uber insane revenue
351320,comparable lol cant even believe discussion
351321,whatever think uber i've skeptical years really become highly profitable means valuation drops
351322,think i'm responding revenue comment
351323,sorry random comment reference nothing else said 
351324,bad assumption think responding lol
351325,could read first word
351326,uber
351327,lol
351328,missing something
351329,well inflated ipos inflated anymore everything permanent dips
351330,title article
351331,maybe would less mental gymnastics certain people fool thinking crypto stock market 100% brockshane
351332,im worried ipo web2 market works clear business makes money shares go value business works general im wondering web3 models end day they're businesses need sustain selling tokens get lots money token may become illiquid eventually least money selling nfts sold product get there's much random stuff like poap 1000 others get poap raised 10m example guess hope eventually becomes profitable somehow big enough nothing grants funding either
351333,unprofitable still dont understand trying get ok
351334,pretty sure nowadays shares go value businesses may make money future
351335,post insinuate uber sort exception wrt profitability nothing sort
351336,care less uber that's irrelevant
351337,sources understand bancor fell behind uniswap sushiswap despite ample capital tech googling brings old article 2019
351338,launched time market interested next profitable ico anything useful bottom fell market started look use market concerned pretending tokens spawn devil therefore bad use ether longer fashionable well seem going back 2 though fun times
351339,tldr lucky
351340,1000s profitable public companies uber extreme end spectrum real point could chosen profitable long time ago revenue matters cursory glance business outside like pretty meaningless
351341,one reasons forced bnt people swaps believe
351342,end spectrum uber also insane amount invested tho magic leap example raised 35 billion without working product
351343,magicleap also crazy story
351344,like understand goal make money following closely assume huge l
351345,doesnt tell whole bunch web3 startups
351346,buts nice interesting though 
351347,raised 500 mil last year
351348,whatever ls really seem factor investors
351349,amazon wasnt proftiable like 20 years chose many companies something basically public companies common good revenue likely could profitable wanted vast majority
351350,vast majority profitable
351351,part one fixed cost would profitable certain size grew enough would market leader think one partly choice
351352,look p 500 go one one check profits 
351353,reinvesting profits growth makes lot sense
351354,dig company's financial statements know strategy know what's going
351355,sp500 vast majority public companies
351356,think reinvest would failed verified
351357,mean turn around that's good far 35b invested extra 500m isnt crazy amounts crazy company could raise much sort product market fit highly unusual point company invested billions r 8 years effort
351358,really relevant anything want look regular businesses operate
351359,lol
351360,amazon 8 years ago profitable brings us back beginning amazons business delivering rapid revenue growth accumulating surplus cash profits every penny cash ploughed back expanding business given business runs permanently loss profits already spent making new businesses
351361,still curious original question resources helpful
351362,certain irony watching discussion starts disagreeing essentially there's equation profitability circle back less conclusion digress
351363,companies raised billions last years investors significant amount revenue justify probably except epic even sustainable revenue model
351364,eventual profitability important that's businesses valued short term speculation impact long term hold water revenue metrics business extremely important looking numbers outside provides little insight amount profit company generate next 20 years
351365,course
351366,true though bets like magicleap extreme exceptions market flowing cash past years saying 70b valuation uber made sense overall non web3 businesses pretty easy understand
351367,important resist conflating businesses different stages different players involved different incentives
351368,differences need explained
351369,early stage startups get 20m valuations can't exit reason valuation may make sense 10% chance becoming worth 1b 50x return investment highly profitable ofc real numbers different might 01% chance bet make sense ev
351370,wework losing billions year even scandal still managed raise like 15 billions private funding recently looking articulate raised around 15 billion 80 million revenue
351371,despite hand wringing rich understanding vc firms lose money average yeah super high risk
351372,coworking businesses extremely extremely profitable high front costs despite taking massive hit 50b expected valuation years back super good businesses worth 10b reason
351373,high risk high reward good vc needs return 3x capital invested many unprofitable long term angels well recent times many likely profitable due overinflated paper valuations ya longer term sp500 much safer bet
351374,goes web3 startups tonne backed vc funds understandable alchemyinfura charge monthly fee nansenicy tools charge monthly fee metamask takes big cut swaps opensealooksrare take 225% trades binancecoinbase make money trades nft creators make money selling nfts artaccessgames tokens world seems many good model v small minority pretty understandable sustainable there's tonne others seem totally wild dont get keep going

351393,firstmargincall use ctrlf lot legal tax questions moreover research chat lobsterdao nft might discuss chat investments alpha stuff
351394,posted lot twitter wrong
351395,shares goes rapidly value business still make money never value speculation revenue companies dropped 5% shares dumped 50% logic shares gone far fed printing historical amount money injected markets enormous amount retail money stuck covid nothing revenue logic afe trying apply companies go ipo spacs whatanot cash
351399,speculation question speculated speculating future revenue based fundamentals therefore dividend growthdecline speculating twitter shills betterworse job bringing greater fools asset
351400,fed macro factors still fundamentals since asset youre holding isnt companyproject working vacuum
351401,saying one way speculation better obviously profitable best would argue lot easier speculate profitably based objective measurable facts data long term
351402,well refer crypto years market can't say im expert know something crypto high beta risk assets scarce hence pumps hardest psychology market applies best possible way crypto like early dot com bubble stonks hence still psychological model euphoria fear working
351403,thats assuming pumps ultimate goal pumps useless theyre almost always followed dump somehow time entries exits right
351404,instead youre asset steadly growing revenue potential profit years dont time entriesexits
351405,basically asset continuously making money holders point pe ratio floor dividends bring mc
351406,nfa
351407,point even really wanna sell tho
351408,basically asset continuously making money holders heh blatant disregard howey
351409,even still makes revenue crypto general sentiment much powerful hence overall market need purge crap
351410,disregard many crypto projects securities whether admit
351411,got example aside maybe btceth dump less pump htf
351412,lol suppose lawyers eventually day
351413,general sentiment powerful within short timeframes long term speculation almost always fundamentals
351414,whats best protocol right terms revenue distribution curve compound
351415,clear revenue distribution isnt profit asset deflating higher rate
351416,aside make money i'm holding token behavior source problems space
351417,mc share therefore revenue share constantly diluted
351418,really profitable protocol accrue value holders dilutes
351419,imo maker case crypto 0 dilution continuous buyback burns
351420,depends whether project state grown sufficiently grow healthily accruing value holders
351421,yet almost always example good working product almost value accrual
351422,bad value accrual method still profitable asset really one hold mkr btw
351423,hence maker never pumped 
351424,sure happens dai grows even every dai existence maker continuously earns interest
351425,applies debtbacked stablecoin providers
351426,i'm sure anything healthy come relationship unless extremely selective let hold token hook crook concentrate hands familiar mkr wasis infamously concentrated token bested eos time
351427,imo token holders owners asset relationship made protocol core team whole operation hire team
351428,eg maker governance successfully executed facilitator offboarding proposals fired people onchain votes
351429,always say snapshot voting isnt governance core team becomes gatekeepers ownership taken holders
351430,true idealistic theory naive practice
351431,works practice onchain gov hiring funding everything
351432,fully agree protocols team basically denies governance allowing snapshot votes happen
351433,like true something forces hand people actually control token dead water reason can't get rid zuck

351875,one hand think kind silly we're making big deal nontransferable nft really new crazy concept hand go show someone large following good reputation comes fitting name powerful narrative simple concept make widely adopted discussed similar memecoin ways actual technically interesting features
351876,even without making bound life could embed hidden data nft links original owner would stand test time
351877,i'd go far saying thing vitalik added paper name clout entails soso technical implementation people care glen weyl's paper would bother putting effort make excuses interesting ideas espoused throw vitalik et voila

351895,unpleasant situation happened team perpetual protocol two dex exchanges v1 xdai v2 optimism token perp top 300 cmc i've trading v1 exchange year everything going great long ago eth started unpeg relatively exchanges remembering increased positions surprise days exchange stopped allowed withdraw even free funds spoiler alameda one pairs cream broke amm everything stopped held fake daovoting neither v1 exchange users could affect anything alameda voted needed got money back many users left six figures minus team course trying hush situation pumped tweets instagrams there's way make public situation found discussion situation vote 1 2 team supposedly consulted community result none proposals community accepted put vote options users control anything end random token holders decided fate refund completely unfair way random holders alameda understand difference options opt 1 refund 50k 10% money opt 2 refund 55k 10% money opt 3 refund 60k 10% money opt 4 refund 700k 90% money figures approximate team want refund anything funds even token perp locked public accounts publicize situation would appreciate someone could help
351896,tongnk elaborate wants
351897,read post theres fifth decision placed grouped community proposals together enough time collate data proposals think like 10 secondly perp used governance protocol given protocol decision voted token holders unsure youd method users vote per suggestion probably would received nothing given largest account could vote take everything finally percentages extremely misleading sum distributed options distributed differently amongst accounts
351899,reincarnated soul token
351901,think vote always lead one first options biggest users tend biggest vote power thats governance works think basis problem rather trade protocol doesnt bother refund people trade keeps going people know happens let users pay
351904,gm lords deep know good examples defi friendly cexes mind cexes want rip founders defi protocols founders selling listing cex curious anything beside launchpads pooling assets depositstake cex offer founders defi protocols
351905,use defi positions collateral
351906,currently proposal phase 0 drop optimism perpetual maybe could inform wider community perpetual user oriented 
351907,mean kind nexo credit card borrows stablecoins collateral time fiat transaction
351908,hi way know calcualte gas spent certain time period address 
351909,u export etherscan csv sum last column
351911,helped thanks
351912,uniswap ever gas refunds 
351913,1inch still running gas refund program

351940,anyone looked terra2 actually yet basically form terra1 without ust actual tech
351941,basically
351942,without ust
351943,new tech far know
351944,what's point luna there's ust
351945,yet another step fucking people result ego maniac dancing grave trying hide numbers vest etc attempt defer selling months line hope even hope gamblers might help recover things
351946,thats wondering well maybe theyll anchor play tether instead subsidize luna
351947,yeah especially fucked without audit trail anything released reserves got traded
351948,emergency cash grab

351962,archive node
351963,etherscan public facing service may data cached etc
351964,merge new blockchain execution layer wont loss history due merge separately plans remove old state working set chain still prevent anyone running archive node full history reexecuting chain
351968, anchor protocol exploited team reason updated bluna oracle classic chain bluna classic started cost luna luna2 result 40mln ust bad debt anchor
351969,anywhere enough liquidity dump 800k ust
351970,yeah kinda liquid several cex 45mln liquidity dex 002 still 200mln cap 10 billion ust
351971,ready exchange copyright nft lol still got video
351973,cuties
351974,consider glory planet ido launch 2st june think worthwhile
351975,
351976,meanwhile anchor 24% today world makes sense sometimes
351977,searching table borrowlend protocols available collaterals like ethwbtcsteth etc saw time ago lost link
351978,dangerous launch token moment without bot protections
351979,sniper bot
351981,really start releasing database performance code auditors
351982,certik one highest rates hacked protocols total audits total hacks
351983,theres lot sub data still need look contract hacked audited time spent auditing total lines code contract code brand new
351984,audits test everything need actually read audit see tested results found
351985,make sure code added audit introduced new issues
351986,probably want go code audit lucky surprised find
351987,
351988,got simple heuristic
351989,written specification document outlining requirements expected behaviors inline developer comments
351990,answer ngmi
351991,layerzero solves
351993,sounds good true cant
351994,univ3 yields quite high keep mind risking principal eth price movements also incur high il stable pairs
351995,yes bizzarely audit firms dont even ask
351996,pretty terrible
351997,
352001,connexant imo
352002,think celer slightly cheaper around 20 current gas prices
352004,list addresses specific erc20 ethereum want know addresses done least one transaction last month polygon idea thinking use polygonscan api
352005,huge one lot exploits find code audited wasnt code deployed
352007,looking back bull run really minefield
352008,hi anyone use uniswap swap widget
352009,god crypto dumb sometimes luna v2 cashgrabbening 6b mc
352010,short somewhere
352011,probably wouldnt underestimate fundamental value convinced lot people buy ponzi coin feels like good way get rekt enough upside
352012,polygonscan api fine oneoff solution could also try covalenthq polygon dataset bigquery
352013,
352014,wow interesting see op launch well
352016,want eat pizza
352017,something funky wrapped version nexus unclear price freely tradeable
352018,dump without kyc
352019,wrapped version freely tradable
352020,could also unwrap kyc claim bigger prize 
352021,there's also moralis deep index
352022,arent mcr would awhile install
352023,ah catch
352024,yeah takes time unstake mcr theres queue exit theres limit much person exit limit size per exit also limited reaches mcr unstaking takes 3090 days think dont remember tbh
352025,thank ser feel better informed
352026,get back learning dev rather speculating things 
352027,anyone honestly idea nexus gets much hate agree token infrastructure isnt best mutual hasnt operated bad actor claims
352028,dont get hate product wise unless related nonpayouts people dont read small print bagholders crying rightfully
352029,coinstats completely safe connect hotcold wallets
352030,connecting doesnt anything ur funds except maybe expose ur ip
352031,weird crypto related websitesservices accept crypto payments fiat
352032,sometimes get delta neutral yield like deposit usdc euler borrow abc xyz create abcxyz position uniswap way earn uniswap yield without exposed underlying quite much
352033,hypothetically speaking borrow rates pretty mcuh always yield amms
352034,depends asset surprisingly there's little demand right shorting long tail assets borrow volumes long tail low means interest rates 0 low
352035,question whether il borrow cost yield
352036,exactly token stays stable token b goes 50% u lose 2% il deltaneutral hedged kinda goes parabolic though
352037,make sure solidity compiler introduce new bugs versions
352038,longtail assets experience harder il thats even worse though
352039,yeah bad dynamically increasedecrease short keep il
352040,sure anything yielding less 2530% becomes tricky manage
352041,i've trying think way euler costly individual basis pooled short position dynamically updated debt
352042,might economical
352043,user would get share debt pool position uniswap changes need repay debt asset borrow asset b
352044,could even without following uni position independently farming position something like token drops 50% increase short 10% token pums 50% decrease short 10% rough numbers also providing ready strategy might dilute yields much
352048,
352049, update kleros attack
352050,chad upgrade
352051,back
352053,still funny
352054,sbf 
352055,lmfaooooo
352056,sam confirmed get bitches tho like said 
352057,gisele one day
352058,tb12 everyday tho
352059,memes r okay lobsterdao kingdom chat stick research get ugly nft join 
352063,
352064,thinking aping yaynay
352065,liquity good
352066,wow ton integrations
352067,first time see explicit takes note
352069,yes well tracking historical hacks hope release stuff people play around end june
352070,sure arrakis poly decent yields afair
352071,project exploited week certik audited 1 paid extra 11k expedited audit 1 week took 3 weeks certik refund fee 2 days launching new contract exploited though certik directly audited exploits updates made code 3 certik contacted expliot still understand happened though complex hack certik basically subbing audits low quality dev farms point 0 accountability
352072,anybody able connect ledger via ledger live chrome
352073,give error time
352074,lmao another certik classic
352075,namebrand
352076,like dre beats
352077,popular even close best quality lol
352079,could check risk manager youd like work database lot tracked id like open source
352080,extremely subjective changes time fast auditors quality changes say every 18 months team members rotate giving ratings investors see personal tldr 
352081,couldnt limit subjectivity adding time variables weights audits based recently done something
352082,absolutely auditors u investors quality changes waaaay often
352083,transparency key currently much space getting something audited secures millions background auditors experience education previously audited projects etc done certik comprehensive legitimate business world would never fly future either they'll accountability auditing firms
352084,agree lot easy though auditors either like edwardf said earlier chat code broken may even reviewed auditors cause code altered werent asked review exploited section definitely want make transparent
352085,auditor standard practice risk assessment code problems looked serverly risky one auditing firm could locked moderate another makes standardizing data difficult taking rating trying combine 1 feels incredibly subjective
352086,bothers cause want underwriting objective possible thats want open source consensus also data backed underwriting would huge defi insurance space standard practice cost coverage could help us move away price bonding model
352088,datadatabaseunderwritingetc keep referring like defined thing
352089,sauce plz
352090,check libre defi
352091,better getting audited letting certik
352092,building dao2dao insurance protocol one thing building database properly underwrite risk lots data lots outputs hopefully db help everyone space
352093,oasisapp uses
352094,imo uni v3 lping kind pvp someone makes lot others arent
352095,ever case actual legit founder exit crypto exit scam something palatable protocol got either acquired another protocol
352096,satoshi 
352097,satoshi went buy milk coming back soon exit
352098, xdai acquired gnosis chain holders taken care hermez acquired polygon sure token swap behaved kain stepped active ops synthetix still worked goes andre yearn 
352099,voyager bought ethos
352100,guess researched polygon acquire lot stuff thanks xdai suffices example looking
352101,gem acquired opensea
352102,think dharma better example gem never private round
352103,
352104,yeah frens
352105,never published anything else
352106,thinkn people give private round enemies
352107,ok makes sense
352108,gotta raise 100m 1b valuation somehow
352109,isnt vcs
352111,oh true true
352112,also tonic finance inverse altho think tsnark team
352113,member charlie noyes leaking internal convo paradigm 1inch's series b
352117,round happened though 180 15b
352118,yeah point remains people give private rounds enemies considering history particular message
352120,i'm exactly sure mean crypto friendly run blockchain nodes contabo works nicely
352121,
352122,fun discussion thought 
352123,recon dapps open directly wants open mm window connect wallet annoying personally prefer choice connect directly clicking button etc
352124,ethereum crypto wallet that's signer
352125,perhaps problem metamask pop option immediately connect cuz imagine opposite took 5 extra clicks finally connect wallet uniswap wed screaming horrible ux
352126,yeah horrible ux goes dapps say wrong network dont give option automatically add said chain mm expect user add rpc details manually beyond stupid
352127,indeed best ones add rpc dont go blank page ur obscure chain
352131,
352132,example project well
352134,anyone knows frax crosschain work anymore
352136,pop crosschain page anymore
352138,released good explainer video 
352139,successful projects building tradfi qis strategies generate yield market volatilty
352140,hello solidus wonder connect possile partnership
352141,someone check math post let know error lot users reporting receiving way less aust expected 
352142,extent forced writing fuzzing invariant tests
352143,probably larger money market codes examples formal verification audits
352144,get 30% upfront
352145,i'm well aware
352146,look whole thread thread saying amount received users included 30% 70% vested correct amount
352148,let alpaca hard work
352149,guys question cross chain experts trying learn bridges work question initiate tx one chain send assets bridge address send destination address different chain exactly manage address bridgeterramoney initiate tx terra chain cant really see place store destination address chain
352150,find recipient address event logs terra
352151,iirc chains enumerated eth l1 chain 2 official terra shuttlebridge
352152,general bridges escrowmint function sent tokens escrow chain get aquivalent mintunlock chain b information passed different bridge bridge different architectures practice overall mechanism
352153,
352154,
352156,thing mate gave us 30% less calculated proposal vestings
352157,good ipfs hosting service one acutally host website pinita slow af also like service test load speeds around world site
352158,use premium gateways simply run node
352160,arweave works well
352161,site built something like npm run build supply built folder arkb use arweavenet arweavedev gateway access
352162,custom domain there's also options
352163,intresting understand would pay 1 time fee files hosted forever
352164,yeah that's right
352165,website data generally cheap
352166,much 1mb worth data
352167,0004 usd
352168,lol ok would custom domains work
352169, provides way arweave hosting custom domains
352170,spent 5 mins site understand anything would love tldr
352171,website github short link site's github select arweave network go
352172,static websites right admins pls ping conv spamy irrelevant
352173,websites run js like call apis etc
352174,i'm actually sure definition non static website days
352175,kinda backend running code api endpoints
352176,whole backend
352177,it'll front end
352178,use arweave backend haha
352179,call site
352180,ok domain thing work arweave work ens
352183,personal gateway seems fast tired browse site using brave ipfsq took forever load
352184,it'd work traditional domain set domain records merchant side spheron's records
352185,although arweave name service built
352186,seems like ethlimo domains arent ready production either cuz ur gonna dependant ethlimo endpoint probably gonna slow wonder chrome going support eth domains guess gonna happen whn there's gonna fincial incentive behind prob people selling web3 services
352187,yeah endpoint centralization issue browser support least see brave supporting ipfs assumably we'll see support decentralised naming services quicker chrome
352188,chrome tho metamask installed
352189,want kinda control website like background color go chain would solution dat
352190,yeah that's production ready
352191,try entering enseth chrome rn
352192,either controlled js controlled via continuous integration github repo reupload automatically
352193,code goes chain react input
352194,jumps google
352195,take us 50ms response via premium gateways check request comes i'm mistaken pinata delivery aws useast1 also main issue ipfs gateways ttfb thats issue case try breakdown site smaller sites
352196,bruh
352197,tested ff well works metamask installed yeah obviously google visit
352198,use mm im saying ready builders gonna build
352199,disagree one thing crypto common metamask install ready works right ens linking flexible lead decentralised ipfs content web2
352200,webdev testing website perf there's bunch
352201,what's comprehensive pricing api tokens
352202,mm anyones main browser phone
352203,
352204,
352205,
352206,someone please explain crypto foundations start company zug
352207,adds legitimacy
352209,said 001% lpers professionals know theyre dodge il
352210,interesting he's surprised ahem useless withoutuse token much anything still high billion
352211,low tax favorable laws
352212,right jobs remote
352213,engineer lives germany would still get taxed according german laws
352214,employer get pay lower contributions
352215,employer doesnt pay tax
352216,social contributions etc
352217,hmm
352218,assume employee pay insurance pension
352219,ja usually payroll construction
352220,universal thing remote working another company
352221,advantage company
352222,unless worker lives ch
352223,different cantons different tax rates
352224,pretty generic construction nothing exotic
352225,scoff 15% tax
352229,want incentivize people anxietydepression vr tasks economic incentives required science part want digital assets want transparent people donate see immediately turned tokens sent people
352230,avoiding anything tokens inside germany cuz i'd get burnt makes sense create ag zug token stuff right
352231,stiftung smth easy create
352232,trying hard sound couchy yes taxation ch definitely lower de income company generates
352233,setting swiss company requires someone lives ch tho fiduciary
352234,easy task
352235,actually get income token things somewhere existing legal framework
352236,way complex pick phone set delaware inc 5 minutes 300
352237,get burnt germany passes laws punishes u following 5 years existed
352238,work employee works employ make social security contributions etc
352239,yea heard lawyers responsible livelihood longer freelancers
352240,much income comes vs clients
352241,go payroll construction shift burden
352242,mean shift burden
352243,payroll invoices corp2corp employee empoyed payroll company handle paperwork payroll usually country residence emplyee
352244,yeah works really cheaper gives tax advantage services actually quite pricy sucks employ germans 
352245,net wage employee goes yes cost business pay xhr
352246,enough ivan wakes bans us couchy
352247,i've always read main advantage better laws regarding privacy less likely government seize servers hand data etc recent marketing store data swiss servers whenever possible taxes probably important long onerous
352248,curious ur data aws gov directly get
352249,gov
352250,western ones
352251,us uk germany france
352252,long arm usg limits 
352253,soso relevant microsoft stated per the usa patriot act us government could access data even hosted company american data resides outside usa 
352254,debug rpc traffic browser
352255,thought seen debuggable metmask somewhere cant find anywhere anymore
352256,calls rpc logged network tab developer tools chromebased browsers
352258,question sustainable play earn model yet
352259,another question im struggling find valid business model interopable metaverse consumer idea great business would want person bring digital stuff world even dev make happen sell another one
352261,anyone know selling security 
352262,definition unsustainable
352263,like question similar open source business model red hat goto usually provide standard service free expands horizontally sell premium services infrastructure support customers sell eyeballs
352267,maybe websites read config contracts optimism one infura call away right buy special api key done without
352268,basically perpetual options instead getting assigned either side pair hits u eat il instead perpetual exposure hedging possible gets difficult take linearly assignment trends towards either edge means delta shifts due high gamma close range edges decent want exposure spot longs volatility
352269,necessarily depending jurisdiction employer isnt obliged make social security contributions
352270,specifically germany
352271,way find exchange trc address belongs
352272,u harvesting people data

352388,op still claimable relax
352389,question official listing fake thing
352390,optimism announce hence fake
352391,lesser known exchanges often list new tokens attract customers doesnt mean fake

352450,true univ2 curve short gamma proxy il expo univ2 similar short put option hedged call v3 strike provide liquidity differences v2 v3 summirized options gamma terms
352451,address eligible like previous web wtf rugged
352452,fairness ratio guys
352453,correct answer marked green
352454,merkle root
352455,haha lol
352456,v2 basic strike 0 infinity technically inefficient terms capital efficiency results lower fees eth ethusdc liq super thicc u wont get much fees chains may still useful lower gamma
352457,actually assume kind strike considering speed il expo sense loss btceth example moves 0 1% 1% 2% difference
352458,say v2s real strikes constantly taking assignment selling prices goes accordingly always 50%token50%2ndtoken
352459,il based initial entry
352460,sort strikes 0 infinity
352461,eligible issue
352462,right
352463,paper article gamma exposure vs univ2 exposure
352464,nothing estrange connected wallet delegated claimed maybe issue website people
352465,thing lping fees compensate instant changes price like 12% il bad accumulates becomes exponential active mm v3 way better
352466,idk id curious formal study
352467,understand better mean active mm
352468,going pools constantly updating range etc basically traditional market maker
352469,il inventory risk traditional market making
352470,lp v3 always worse short gamma deribit moreover let's say
352471,
352472,way calculate implied volatility lp v3 make easier compare short put perpetual option
352473,jib0xd
352474,apparently team testing i'm showing noneligible
352475, formulas idk accurate 20% iv makes sense intuitively premium way low
352476,cry emoji
352478,
352479,use starkgate u cna guys
352480,eth full u dai
352481, found one
352486,according discord isnt supposed life people sneaked testing phase
352487,others claimed straight via smart contract although straight forward
352488,
352489,someone wants look almost 1400 people claimed already
352490,check medium 
352491,using abi using example remix
352492,need merkle proof
352493,right get
352494,interacting contract
352495,write delegate maybe 
352496,need dev guide us 
352497,yes already read articles easy want understand formulas remember well valid univ3 curves
352498,frontend loaded claim 1 wallets
352499,claim op via contract
352500,removed ton sybills mine although people claiming clearly multiple wallets
352501,possible yes
352502,anyone knows speed transaction metamask seem allow increase gas optimism
352503,whats claim link see coming soon
352504,change rpc public one infura
352507,know might sound like noob terms understanding technical weeds definitly could elaborate
352508,yeah main thing get merkle proof provide claim function anyone knows
352509,
352510,contract unverified tho
352511,prob requires front end interaction correct
352512,need able interact contract abi directly without using etherscan
352513,anyone contract address
352514,
352515,claim still working
352517,rats
352518,correct
352519,would recommend remix
352520,hey guys anyone maybe spare tickets ethcc paris 
352522,look actual data see research guillaume lambert realize average returns approximately 0% risk high 
352525,use ctrlf ban
352526,iteract
352527,unverified contracts
352528,op airdrop
352529,announced 30 minutes ago
352530,yeah understand someone saying mm active liquity providers univ3 works much better univ2 backtest well true stated tweet well delta positive position understand comparison respect holding 2 tokens instead lping
352531,uni v3 best jit liquidity providers ones make meaningful returns see research bancor 
352532,jit definition
352533,time liquidity providers think people hyperconcentrating liquidity providing one block see big trade coming mempool
352534, note current version starkgate alpha support browser use chrome connect joke
352535,basically extracting value legit liquidity providers think someone dex conference amsterdam analyzed volumes 30% total fees captured jit liquidity providers anyway trying build amm efficient lps swaap
352536,never thought brilliant
352537,give check insane sum normal user advantage providing liquidity v3 curve instead univ2 average really see advantage conversation
352538,non stable pairs least
352539,claim op
352540,personally lping v2 rewards year like clear txs onchain claim rewards etc
352541,muted month
352542,normal user wouldnt provide liquidity current amms non stable pair would rather stake tokens provide liquidity lending pools current return risk ratio profile amms bad unless add liquidity mining incentives top thats ponzinomics understand product fails deliver adequate returns lps really want lp professional active market maker would definitely go v2 style amms
352543,v3 offers called clm concentrated liquidity managers like arrakis gamma strategies manage v3 position crunched data seems dont overperform liquidity providers see amber report 
352545,anyone experience aware someone able wrap nft collection owners bridge nft differing chains
352546,essence big issue amms explains strategies dont good return risk profile perform two things time price discovery identifying right price asset market making providing liquidity asset pair make efficient fact things time greatest strenghth able list token without relying external data also greatest weakness pay arbitrageurs update prices pools value extracted basically impermanent loss
352553,dont send weird op claim links redacting everything dumb
352554,lol ok
352555,might correct safu risking makes sense sowwy socket
352562,yea totally understand
352563,makes perfect sense
352564,safu better rekt
352565,ivan degen
352567,market maker tradfi cefi strategy amm like expect amm rely external data feeds advanced algorithms strategies actually yield consistent returns lps building 
352568,apps optimism lagging af jesus
352569,saw github claimming op think wait op team
352570,op network lagging like hell 
352571,airdrop
352572,metamask uni 1inch lagging
352573,interface hordes hitting contract directly
352574,still can't figure rip
352575,rpc getting hammered
352576,hopefully well paid vc backed devs fair share valley high profile startups exposure know scale aws infra
352577,use vc money something good
352578, actually works fam tested
352579,ok fine adrian confirmed otherwise email government
352580,aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
352581,sent like 10min ago didnt want keep unless someone checked leaking alpha
352582,know know thanks vaibhavchellani
352583,thanks getting banned jail
352584,safu
352585,oh fk u changed ur name jfc
352586,didnt recognize u haha
352590,anyone private op rpc lagging like hell ankr seems skipped
352591,u make alchemy
352592,
352593,create alchemy account get one free worked like charm
352594,
352595,fuck
352596,87c transaction op
352597,gives uni airdrop vibes
352598,gross 1000 gwei day
352599,back day i've found somewhat surprisingly heaps uni tokens airdropped way airdrop sold 30 per uni something
352600,regrets
352601,
352602,make memes cause can't use network
352610,hope ivan let mess happen w gear
352611,think lot ppl talk il stable pairs plus there's long term data looks multiple cycles determine return correlated assets like ethwbtc know uni v3 position made 1% return yesterday past 4 daysthough due mostly eth dumping pumpingstill better imo long term holding btc eth next bullrun dominance starts dropping
352612,lobster semiprivate rpc share dms open
352613,tried testnet works well offering free integration existing nft project wanting go multichain 
352614,ok calculate point say finding interesting part like options iv get breakeven multiplying 1 sqrt 365 price try beat implied realized movement right amm lp iv adjust automatically bc receive higher volatility also consequence higher swap fees calculate point considering costant ratio swapfeesbe iv simulate worth partecipate liquidity provider imagine market adapt statistical aebittage actually make money lp incentivized like sushi dexes farm token think risk farming actually low enough terms rugexploit
352615,sign one alchemy
352616,low number transactions cool use free one
352617,would love currently stuck missing flight convinient
352618,lobs created one please share via dm
352619,im confused cant go website type email pick password get free rpc provide
352620,access rpc access https website sign
352621,talking telegram use literal device sign service
352622,spin machine
352623,sign one alchemy
352624,read suggestion
352625,ever spin rpc machine
352628,infura also rpc provider free tier
352630,literally go link make account give rpc url use
352631,takes like 30 seconds
352632,need credit card details
352633, get
352634,
352635,1 alchemix v2 yet support small screens please get larger screen resize browser window 2 account cause use different provider private rpcs want create account spin vm
352636,alchemy
352637,vm
352638,ohh tried using infura told add credit card tho
352639,mayen hurry read properly 
352640,transaction go sign create new app choose network optimism name give something want optimism mainnet click view keys able see https link copy link metamask change rpc endpoint url one copied faster public rpc slow right
352641,
352642,maybe changed cc attached account use infura backup rpc
352643,help
352644,mmmm
352645,know what's faster sharing
352646,plus sharing caring
352647,imagine might tightened things
352648,serrrrr
352649,free tier
352650,barely
352651,actually faster people rightly expose rpc endpoints public internet
352652,enough request
352653,
352654,dmed u one ser dont share
352655,seconds shared
352656,exposed rpc endpoints public internet lost 5 figures ask nothing
352657,
352659,oh wow
352660,hard someone shares community
352661,well yes endpoint going pretty much worthless today
352662,go ahead use free requests lobsters
352663,change want see world
352664,excellent work
352665,happend alot ppl used pay
352666,system key loaded someone able ask submit transaction key
352667,within 2 minutes open might add
352668,like literally opened port opened log watched say executing ethsendtransaction 
352669,expensive lesson
352670,modern ethereum clients even capability anymore type issue
352671,actually bit risky part agencies like fbi investigate crypto scam chase rpc callers get data centralised node providers like alchemy told founder top100 coin something privacy
352672,mean tons reasons share
352673,guys free account helping lobster navigate latency heavy times
352674,want avoid using things like give individual users api key
352675,providing liquidity volatile pool share fees farming rewards heavily inflated token defi 20 doubled stack eth past 8 months risk il diminishing returns growing pool chasing yield always direct claim eth contract level without depending dao vote multisig release funds sure eth price might tank always access underlying eth eth stack grows fees like irl reward token created expressly farming may may lasting value future depending governance revenue intent ability founders community strength million factors
352676,ribbondopexanother structured product
352677,thats true although compute il even liquidity pools exist v2 like amms using tool instance weth wbtc pair impermanent loss reached 479% 010116 010522 means need 1055% apy break even today apy uni v2 26%
352678,serious question anyone know optimism decided airdrop launch rather bad market seem like huge urgency wait
352679,mean race market share atm
352680,clearly wasnt working competing alt l1s without ability brrrr
352681,true never done liquidity funds usually price amm positions like options essentially hedge buying another option see crab strategy opyn instance usually payoff negative cumulate positive times especially pool incentivized mean long run farming opportunities disappear tokens accrue much value market starting realize
352682,better launch token bear market community green time instead red fudding
352683,that's super interesting point actually true uponly launch bottom
352684,since raising money valuation irrelevant
352685,depends goals project look pump price well that's pospone launch idealbetter market conditions
352687,yeah really matters actually trying ico raise money obviously valuation matters
352688,backwards haveare getting money token matters theoretically quite bit
352689,
352690,liquidate though going give x% supply away really doesnt matter price
352691,total supply 4ish billion right even price drop still like 5b mc
352692,can't liquidate anything without counterparty really tangible 5b see luna
352696,could suggest find abi unverified contract
352697,speaking univ2 curve example right provide liquidity univ2 incentivzed ethusdc pool instance what's way calcultae right options straddle position proxy hedge il moreover perpetual option market maybe ftx idea
352698,would elaborate
352699,beleive could use squeeth theory also heard appears expensive practically useful
352700,said ethusd pool curve eg without btc hedging would probably easy uni2 sushi
352701, squeeth historical daily funding 032% like that's per day
352702,almost like uniswap lping ev something
352703,squeet
352704,squeeth yeah squared eth option price designed follow eth squared theoretically good hedge constantproduct invariants expensive though
352705,quite interesting cheap lps willing sell vol think big part lps see way take profits dca assets similar lot people use ribbon vaults maybe alternative ways sell vol like primitive finance makes market efficient unsure though
352706,think im optimistic panoptic finance approach
352707,anyone ambire kcc gone
352708,ivogeorgiev guess
352709,realized posted trying post frens group lol
352710,pls ser use
352711,calculating wethbtc pair years uniswap existed also use uni v3 used v2 much since v3 came 17% today uni v3 pair though that's using defi llama dashboard would bet higher reality would check fees vs liquidity past 24hrs sure
352713,impermanent loss calculate since depends following variables none related pool prices weth wbtc beginning period prices weth wbtc end period
352714,v3 yield essentially depends ability use right ranges liquidity average liquidity providers neutral negative payoff doesnt mean dont profit congrats 
352715,average 90% ppl prob lose money investing crypto 
352716,anyone know toolwebsite lets see token amounts wallet certain time back history say want know contents jan 1 2021
352717,tools check gas fees spend till
352721,
352722,ssl unsecure connection
352723,hello guys new group fortunately became aware group blocksplit3 event croatia currently writing bachelor thesis applications ethereum financial industry answer main question applications ethereum exist financial industry planned talk dapps defi guys ideas add every link idea would helpful thank guys awesome 
352724,daaps decentralizedapps anything defi related social apps whatever ps note sentence seems put level defi probably want want talk given want talk financial applications yes defi protocols dapps interfaces connect operate smart contracts basically defi stuff google get gazillion articles options lending amms sauces gl
352725,paper says defi 1 9 categories dapps thats mention main part
352726,
352727,looking timetravel feature like ages maybe lefterisjps rotki roadmap already 
352728,op drop 
352729,yeah easy long access archive node
352730,couldnt derive point time token transfers
352731,yeah long every token interested transfer event spoiler
352732,tokens erc20721 1155 form transfer anyway
352733,top head aave tokens
352734,balance changes block
352735,cool someone send link one scs
352736,actually change internal change withdraw actual transfer happens sounds pretty annoying 
352737,guess call balanceof calculated dynamically
352738,
352740,guys find good projects ever second theres scam token launched get help finding legit projects
352741,uniswap
352742,checkout weird erc20 repo
352743,
352744,thanks 
352745,wanna know there's project token value makes sense beyond speculation still get entire world built speculation
352746,people think future going better past otherwise fucked
352747,uniswap document goes contracts functions know thorough test suite recall something like give example thinking something like rai's geb outline contracts work words specifying expectations function
352748,example ens investors centralization holders debts governance protocol constant revenue name fees
352749,investors centralization holders follow ser
352750,typical vc funded team big allocation investors thus centralization holders need pay back money get somehow 
352751,centralization exists inspite vcs
352752,vcs give acceptable excuse way
352753,launched yet
352754,question anyone gaming xr dev realistic web assembly unreal engine unity user experience
352755,goal game inside games thro browser without user wait 13 seconds thing load
352756,
352757,love weth depositswithdrawals
352758,wrap unwrap guy
352759,
352760,get cause weth9 uses guy
352761,whitepaper
352762,also audits audit url link 
352763,
352764,something less 'i need phd understand this' would go see yearn stratagies
352765,typically written prior authoring contracts part due diligence
352769,easy way calculate liquidation price point loan compound want get usdc loan coin wondering price coin would go get rekt
352770,that's roughly dependent loan value
352771,yeah right smaller ltv deposited amount less likely youll get liquadated
352772,u turbo stack long increases ltv extra maths see u get fully liquidate inclusive loan lolo
352773,35 coinbase 
352782,luck getting transfer coinbase sent test transactions nothing showing wallet yet
352783,metamask hardly even recognizes op network let alone lets anything good first day op
352784,used alchemy rpc still bitch
352785,problems claiming sending across wallets transfers coinbase seem delayed
352786,ok using one 
352787,deposit coinbase directly optimism network
352788,sent one exchanges claiming got coins able withdraw though see op tradable coinbase cant get
352789,sign alchemy get optimism rpc
352790,obviously limited still better default
352791,yep rugged
352792,havent rugged yet crypto think employer pretty soon
352793,
352795,gm lobster fam long time since posted smth 3 finished new article crypto opsec hope youll enjoy 
352796,
352797,probably use tool we've build analyse holders time series example one interesting eth whale even plot asset price better visual analyses picture attached lefterisjp correctly said tokens complicated time travel
352802,
352803,pretty disappointed
352804,possible still kind issues
352805,indeed web2 part infra
352806,
352807,
352808,test really cannot believe rpc bottleneck
352809,hope good devops transition web3 help manage traditional infra
352810,got airpod similar ust amount cashed close depeg
352811,tried crtl f gro one know happened
352812,markets markets
352813,nvm found 
352814,wonder part liquidity incentive program better fine print
352815,general stuff feiondo think fraxondo
352816,ondo yes terms communicated
352818,fact dump token end day interesting
352819,layer top anchor
352822,didnt follow case carefully users lose lot money vaults
352825,match side gib shitcoin gib stablecoin end day loan turns less usd provided make sure match back keep stablecoin issuance par
352826,logical right aint taking shitcoin risk cause would market maker instead r neutral position value expense ur token dumps
352828,ondo finance fei collaborating provide liquidity service gro protocol looking etherscan seems somewhere 117 days ago 97 days ago ended 118m tokens 30% circulating supply today dumped uniswap without knowing details would calling ondo finance's management treasury question gro protocol 
352830,gro layer curveconvex providing stablecoin vault employed strategies protocols past
352833,well ondo one side provides stables loses volatile asset drops 90%
352834,junior side's risk 
352836,gro yield aggregator indeed people using junior tranche vault product lost funds due exposure ust3crv curve pool whilst senior pwrd product remained protected earning interest designed
352838,logical know suspect anyone used ondo based storytelling better alternative liquidity farming mercenaries expecting getting bed appears industrial scale oneshot mercenary
352839,guess 90% protection work shitcoin liquidity outside ondo's market actually 90% protection ondo's tranchess laas separate products afak
352841,tbh stated projects openly exactly reason gearbox members far move forward ondo risk downside feiondo dumping pretty big see gro apy ask small much smaller retail would want size big ye clause catch
352842,clauses public find details docs rebalancing operations excess liquidity end contract
352843,nice goodbye community contract ends 
352844,sure mean believe ondo mercenary pay x provide liquidity also add shitcoins shitcoins totally reasonable clear books
352845,usually contract gets renewed
352846,happened alcx times
352847,maturity renew lessen impact however ngl rough
352849,yeah seems better runofthemill liquidity program
352850,posturing mercenaries bad we're better even skin deep
352851,tbf im guessing gro option renew contract could've alleviated problem sense feiondo multiple ways preventing dump either otc deals
352852,mercs dump relentlessly
352853,sounds like mercenary steps
352854,least know counter party right right
352855,worse singular party dump everything single go without qualms
352856,zomg dirty token cleaning books
352857,never mind fact dirty tokens thing makes relevant
352858,talks can't say exactly happened speculate perhaps they've cleared gro perhaps definitely bad look ondo 100% agree
352859,well ondo's recent 225m fundraise coinlist plus 20m round peter thiel involved they're decentralising product split tranches offer retail
352860,really initial vc loving sale got degens confused apart
352861,think asked ondo responded openly
352863,think issue feitribe token sale uncapped people aped hard governance token pretty much downtrend ever since

353175,
353176,consider adding caveats docs 
353177,wordy storytelling nice fine expected even docs sell something without caveats perhaps idea reveal caveats someone jumped gun convinced offering good alternative standard runofthemill liquidity mining
353178,docs reflect community vaults terms apply laas private dao2dao offering discuss daos directly since program tailored there's lot handholding laas upcoming example goldfinch see terms described governance post
353179,liquidityasaservice laas offering started create vaults daos would put native tokens one tranche source base asset investors tranche community vault
353180,could explain understanding volatile tokens combines stables disastrous il perspective looks lot like tokemak
353181,community vault mean vaults tailored community investors dao treasuries ie dao2dao community vaults offered directly website see expired vaults none open moment community invests directly goldfinch vault community vault also dao2dao vault goldfinch frax funds come treasuries community
353182,suggestions find good chats crypto telegram
353183,that's quote docs what's page supposed describing
353184,exactly primary purpose laas variable tranches increase liquidity token generate profit meant cheaper alternative pool2 liquidity mining paying market maker like jump bribing protocols like tokemak etc that's offer community directly
353185,found sir look
353186,i'm sure understand question laas special type vaults focused daos pretty much everything applies vaults applies laas laas extra considerations
353187, first table community vaults second table laas vaults
353188,
353189,goal community vaults make profit goal laas vaults increase token liquidity
353190,link shared laas community vaults
353191,right fail see brought community vaults
353192,i'm sure asking
353193,could clarify
353194,go 
353195,ah docs primarily focus community vaults provide highlevel overview laas main reason laas fairly tailored specific partners point certain terms communicated directly goldfinch post example planned vault terms nonetheless docs mention assets rebalanced maturity pay back senior tranche see workflows ondo swaps usdc eth needed order service redemptions grofei vault settled like standard vault there'd massive gro liquidation back vault expired tribe gro agreed settle via otc instead ultimately settle tribe decided sell tokens

353290,lowered without much loss
353291,hey guys developing yield routing protocol need feedback advisory could someone point us find main concept routing among aggregators like beefyautofarm
353292,aggregating aggregators
353293,yeap lol would mind look wp discussion
353296,heard like aggregators put
353297,lol main idea provide users simple tool finding best yield farmingrecompoundat moment
353298,interested hear something tangential vein could benefit tech like working erc4626
353299,thats aggregating aggregator
353300,yes may sounds good pros new users might useful
353301,idea aggregate aggregatorsfarmingsstakings provide best users
353302,send dm put together standardized api might interested utilizing yall
353303,one cool thing create deflationary tokenomics main idea create something like sum burnsum unfreeze concept far ideal unfreezing schedule pointed infinity concept believe good cause linear stuff bs
353304,burning come revenues
353305,yes
353306,revenues
353307,thats nothing new interesting per se fact burning tokens like retail narrative useful thing u get rid expansion possbilities
353308, anyway fin discussion sowwy giving floor reason rn 
353309,asked advice received everything cool love chat 
353310,sorry ivan adding bit many shitcoins tried implement hyperdeflation fact work well cause sell pressure hyperincreasing well
353311,really depends math tbh
353312,math work favor senpai
353313,depends many factors keeping aside speculation premium market conditions etc depends product good question much money really aggregating aggregators since taking fee top farming adding coin might aggregate slap fee top inflation attract depositors doesnt make much sense sure anyway 
353315,anyway shill fest place hope brief feedback helped going cool buy nft ask kingdom u want dd

353431,yeap also i'm sold tokenomic update subgraph curators get staked tokens cut
353432,isnt like 10% penalty update
353433,might tho
353434,video presentation
353436,biggest blocker tbh subgraphs would take thousands upgrade
353437,thank bear market making cheaper right
353438,yeap also developing subgraph correctly easy looks complex dapps might take lot bug fixing something stable tbh fact cutting features subgraph make stable kek
353439,mood
353440,tried writing tests
353441,time
353442,way right opinion think indexing writing contracts
353443,matchstick framework pretty new afaik started last week write unit tests

353445,went pretty deep matchstick yearn vaults subgraph takes lot effort get anything remotely close 100% coverage
353446,yeap completely honest feel debugger graphs would 1000x improvement
353447,yeah would big

353486,worked well satoshi's case
353487,lets compare shib bitcoin sure
353488,well interesting question whether decentralized project leaders eventually disappear
353489,shib fails coz ryoshi disappeared means decentralized project succeeded talents contributors
353490,talents
353491,really comparing dog shit copy pasta bitcoin

353550,everyone sybils airdrop gives op volume gets airdrop op says op token dumpers bad literally reason volume mechanism airdroppers much better distribution mechanism solidly let's give protocols they'll behave correctly
353551,checked chart looks like tokenomics set downward facing dog position
353552,clearly solidly tokenomics surprisingly bad given big brains behind even surprising forks like dystopia decided keep tokenomics
353553,least velo improved reward schedule bad thing really fixing issue liquidity lockers would need secondary liquidity lockers otherwise attractive lock years afraid without doesnt really work yet
353554,argument giving tokens basically described transient tx spammers 
353559,mean need biggest challenge crypto fair distribution without giving preferences presales network participation fairer price instead discounted rounds least ppl got put capital actual network

353725,anyone heard integrallink basically onchain otc large orders devs recently launched product called size slogan size matters last year raised 30mln heavily underradar worthily yesterday came across twitter account project idea chain otc large orders name slogan integral's product getting right guy stole idea name slogan existing product raised 6 mln 
353727,nope integral size amm built large whale swaps new sizemarkets otc trades vested unvested tokens
353729,
353730,ok idea part different name slogan still looks fishy
353731,can't comment part either team labelindex large 2m dex swaps integral saw huge market need new size otc vested tokens plus 3ac invested still cache
353732,cache
353733,cachet
353734,decompiler gives readable solidityesque code unverified contracts
353735,install panoramix newer version better last tried version etherscan
353736,oh thought etherscan already used latest version cool try
353737,might past wasnt latest im sure updated though

353742,know studios pt either went web3 well ended acquired become devs large crypto corp cough uphold cough
353743,wait ptsd 2017 ico would become web3 studio
353744,bad ptsd we're sadistic srlsly joking indeed craziest times company successful end raised 22m project got acquired months ago
353745,traumatised huge bags cash

353755,germany strong lobby group block unnecessary bills eu
353756,people bodied greens boiling oceans nonsense
353757,blockchain group strong connection current finance minister includin patrick tweeted also one whatsapp group openly discuss
353758,yes crypto lobby germany pretty strong whatsapp group indeed good mostly german language
353759,anyone know list accelerator programs crypto 
353760,
353761,bad reads
353762,consequential state transitions reckon probably going detectable differences executing simulated vs actual environment foolproof either
353763,smart contract detect simulation assumed whole point simulation mainnet smart contract indistinguishable
353764,would detect behave would reality actual onchain interactions that's experience tenderly example sim mode within defi saver users could issues things simulated though something may always handled properly
353765,simulation done locally mainnet fork assume
353766,can't could whatever would right contract code simulator could override code proceed usual
353767,blockcoinbase whitelist largest miners instance
353770,easily override state add whitelist
353771,also would mean users would mercy tx falling smaller miners bad luck
353772,well important made money etc
353773,know behind tbh
353774,whitecollars making retail classic
353775,say dont say
353776,thomas greco
353777,yes contract interact steal rune think i've shown example around year ago
353779,never heard tbh
353780,blz proofs conspiracy
353781,cannot sadly going kicked insiders group lol get private seed rounds haha
353782,could requires would require someone figure change also reasonable amount time would leave pretty large window opportunity phishing scams
353783,
353784,probably would good enough cover 9095% hashrate scammer would get couple less rune
353785,
353786,lmao 
353787,either we're mixing conversations fully missed question answering rune 
353788,attacker could simply rug user detects guesses tx simulated eg checking blockcoinbase whitelist top miners since ganache etc usually set blockcoinbase 0x0 something iirc displaying state transitionsemitted eventswhatever would end useless case
353789,still leave holes attempted patch bad design ethrune token contract displaying users signing etc
353790,showing users would happen sent tx bad gives false sense security
353791,i'm aware talking different things guess
353797,
353798,dear couch lawyers mobile game still mobile game coins play withdrawn crypto
353799,couch lawyer think app stores wont allow source im couch app store expert since read couple articles
353800,apple definitely obviously google started getting aggressive enforcing inapp payments policy
353802,shame got gabagool weve disaster arbitrarily high fees make good role model
353803,legal issue app stores want cut money control payments amazon still wont let buy kindle books phone app
353804,free api testnetsuch kovan contract event logs
353805,hitting kovan rpcs
353806,dune run testnets business model even tho mainnet one either really
353807,yeah graph support testnet either sometimes projects want collect testnet datas launch mainnet
353808,eh 
353809,prioritise what's higher demand clearly demand mainnets data small subset users interested testnets data would stupid prioritise stuff smaller tam
353810,yeah one think costs running whole thing always run etl host database running airflow instance computational cheap postgres sql aws quite expensive
353811,believe best option making script querying rpc transforming events csv hard
353814,actually testnet instance charts even tho slowly queued migrateable mainnet formally deployed ease lot data design problems imo it'd nice disposable etls ensure users abuse service decode contract 1mth
353815,
353816,

353864,
353865,paid option came across never used guy recommended knows frontend stuff
353867,anyone thoughts polkadot switch away counsel towards liquid democracy model delegate tokens representative choice im excited see turns time concerned itll turn political spectacle elections type feeling
353868,really transitioning multicouncil model rather strictly tricameral governance system case direct improvement since different councils hopefully different expertise rather popularity contest
353869,oh hm listened podcast yesterday course cant find sounded like counsels discarded entirely possible misunderstood
353870,liquid democracy model delegate members counsel rando choose
353871,
353872,think thats episode
353873,council technical committee alongside tokenholders pass referendum like forkless upgrade simple variable change xcm message would previously two options 1 ask council make motion councilors agree either negative turnout bias super majority fail simple majority dotksm holders vote referendum 2 propose publicly pleb positive turnout bias super majority approve technical committee could expedite pending referendum make execute faster nothing else one problems setup council popularity contest anyone could nominate enough votes got lot councilors never voted single thing way kick someone except voted whipping council important dynamic council system subgroups subcouncils dedicated specific things rather one council ability issue motion example technical council runtime upgrades treasury council approves treasury requests etc reality lot overlap still exist member groups council looks like much better people able kind specialize
353874,oh interesting okay yeah episode definitely wasnt particularly clear edited add could also changed since recorded march
353875,sub councils avoid popularity contest issue
353876,people popular certain contexts many times contextspecific groups theory makes sure people argue candidacy actual credentials
353877,vote delegation whole core point podcast part excited see itd work
353878,nominate part eg treasury council people delegate like single council
353879,
353880,larps try recreate entire vertical horizontal
353881,time explain we're going back irc
353884,ahh okay see basically people compete votes areas actually least supposedly qualified thats cool
353885,yeah theory
353886,discord sucks points sure good luck building something similarbetter web 3 friendly dealing issues goes 
353887,abt discord
353888,can't say i'm addicted discord litteraly hating nvm 2 cents probably better convo group
353889,
353890,speaking
353891,irc could work well web3 especially developing irc v3 standard
353893,thatthey great hype past
353894,weird claim polkadot biggest dao alive active recent experiment reputational avatars doubled turnout far active onchain decision making body objectively
353895,niche eco users big moat governance incredibly successful 100 referenda executed successfully past year half
353898,time fork keybase apechain wallet
353900,governance scale well users
353901,see
353905,think answered question 4th may
353906,still even users important voting power based turnout plus lockup buffs imo works well
353908,incentivizes random voting sake voting completely counterproductive
353909,also unreasonable expect every token holder governance
353910,botted know they'll probably delegate
353911,25b reserve
353912,
353913,whats tetra play wasnt goal pusd higher make people go mint via protocol lp back ratio restored arent breaking parameter first actually make imbalanced dumb
353917,think might thinking little highly average tokenholder people indeed click random choice
353918,maybe use bot vote see snapshot proposals explicitly told vote filter bots
353919,exactly
353920,studied pretty extensively point also includes people hold tokens cex cannot expect everyone vote must makes sense system scale
353921,system fsr left seems working well infinitely improved secret voting
353922,comparing actual voting system country pretty legit case tbh
353923,everybody vote incentivizing voters lead bots punishing vote lead issue
353925,similar actual country governance extent yeah

354036,comms design fundamentally different matrix potentially incompatible matrix every user manage key e2ee matrix server doesnt key management comm relies community keyserver reencrypt content given changing community key set case lobsterdao somebody like ivan would run comm keyserver laptop home server cloud server allows comm keyserver host applications complex chat still securely encrypted example photo sharing application twitterlike feed things cant e2ee matrix many different participants needs keyserver reencrypting content participants keys admit understanding comm matrix little bit rusty learn comms architecture different roughly
354037,maybe misunderstanding semantics entirely possible matrix matrix instance keys managed individual participants managed server side still need passphrase like server controls encrypted chats event spec matrix assume chat default easily adopt number flexible usecase
354039,yeah guess possible suspect would require custom server custom client people couldnt properly use element accounts possibly wouldnt even portable across regular matrix synapsedendrite homeservers comm keyservers kind defeats point would make poor ux
354040,really unlikely
354041,agree custom client would want something feels web3 native maps wallets 3pid system matrix think fine regular matrix homeservers scenario creating keyserver creating custom client lets create identity created using web3 address whenever participate larger matrix ecosystem homeserver takes care establishing identity

354308,maybe text better video understand better cowswap
354309,cowswap splits large amount among several dexes get best price minimise slippage make one step arbitrage coins participating swap get amount
354310,kazakh make mistakes sometimes find typo please
354311,thanks sounds super dramatic though
354312,set relayers polygon bsc happy field questions
354313,routes coins
354314,routes like cowswap buy coins pairs stablecoins sell pairs basis currency make arbitrage basis currency goes
354315,basically abritrages stables takes best route aka routing like uniswap done forever maybe i'm missing something
354316,determine coins bought arbitrage gas costs size become unfeasible gas costs swaps eat away arbitrage profit
354317,uniswap worst routing multihop routes 100% tokens one way another split transaction parts 1 inch bit better uniswap study defi
354318,study defi oof
354321,
354323,easier could read something watch weird 2 minute video understand stopped halfway ask clarification everyone studies defi weird videos ty 
354324,please avoid vehemence gentlemen ladies
354325,yea way check validity messages farm42 larp prime position fuck anyone save
354326,great questions arbitrage happens onchain contract however define coins arbitrage offchain monitoring system tracks coins major dexes feeds smart contract suitable assets arbitrage gas cost taken account limit number tokens arbitrage additional token adds value also adds gas costs balance
354327,dont like videos darling check 
354328,thanks dear first time hearing
354329,im pretty sure larp nothing common reality actually
354330,great concept video could better werent explaining id heuristically put scam bucket
354331,first video 
354332,based gut feeling improbability exploit begin
354333,impossible true dont fall cheap psyops guys exploits impossible due tgs infrastructure lol nothing add maybe signal fudding telegram
354334,excelsior 
354336,well one way another sure bumpy ride kek
354337,mention what's weird slowrelease weeks benefit dumping everything cause panicfud
354338,built shorts
354339,thats literally guys mo spying making actionable yea feel like exploit like would've leaked way earlier especially ukr stuff happening
354340,things could written person incredibly far understanding telegram protocol weaknesses undoubtedly exist look task sowing panic among technically unskilled people done kudos signal team lol especially mr snowden
354341,arbitrage done swap also arbitrage prime mevbots plan gaining value beating
354342,everyone plan take time read chats
354343,time could point resources
354344,telegram docs zerodium website telegram api thats impossible thats lol
354345,telegram groups encrypted
354346,they're
354347,claim access dms impossible even though encrypted e2e
354348,big honeypot aims track peoples reaction big accounts delete criminals something hide
354349,oh thought claiming groups dms makes way improbable
354350,point asking mainly always case though something impossible might impossible maybe i'm offbase case recent office 0day
354351,smart though
354352,decide believe random twitter larper
354353,exploits posted special media anons even take recent microsoft 0day case
354354,seen research interesting findings much better providing liquidity higher fee tiers eg 30 bps rather 5 bps main pairs ethstable btcstable btceth better uni v2 passive uni v3 due density professional market makers sample size well chosen though eth price didnt move much 16th september 28th march means low impermanent loss
354355,start anons tho
354356,im 995% chance fake would like cover bases
354357,one eternal blue case looked like simply posted without warming
354358,yep thats i'm pressing f doubt weeks warming random person dying apologizing family lots weird red flags
354359,gonna leak stuff like solstarter dumb stuff nobody really cares guess we'll find trade tho personally
354360,arbitrage done time transaction large enough move basis currency special type arbitrage created captured destroyed trader transaction transaction arbitrage mev bots nothing eat
354361,1 doubt entire thing seems written overly dramatic way plus stuff like receive 7zip archive ahead time passwordprotected like what's point typical psychological technique get someone believe hold something real
354362,maybe virus lmao file wont stay fud long fully undetected crypto fud building largest audience possible leak file gullible boom mass infected steal bored apes takes tinfoil hat

354953,thanks reply sure ctrl f
354954,guess yes 
354957,
354958,curious guy discover address
354959,holy fuck
354960,op airdrop bags dead 
354961,rugged
354962,interesting savage indeed chain halt likely doesnt justify rescuing 20m op
354963,cause fudders proponents shitchains get insane ammunition years come case
354964,sad stuff really 
354965,noticing big amount op moving
354966,lmfao
354967,exactly
354968,like instant creation conract probably checked blz check
354969,deployed token contract time people bound watching still speedy move deploy multisig target address time
354970,assuming gnosis factory contract address optimism hacker brute force right nonce get desired address addresses smart contracts output 2 inputscreatorpubkeynonce anyone confirm method used get control 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address optimism
354971,either price rekt governance rekt
354972,price rekt per se 2% fdv small agree op would also prefer halt attack chain birth
354973,wintermute promises buy tokens hacker happens back normal
354974,crazy thing knew airdrop claim went anyway
354975,9 day difference tokens coming contract creation
354977,damn
354978,could made
354979,second test million op
354980,u guys smart i'm enlightened
354981,vmihov late 
354982,omfg details terms grant like 20m mm details appart fuck
354983,another inside job
354984,
354985,dog eats dog
354986,explanation done 
354987,embedded option interest rate aaaaaaaanyone muh collectivism
354988,usually mm contracts like wintermute gsr jump etc working daos loan structure shitcoin mms 2018 follows loan tokens 123 years side orderbook eth usdc whatever balance sheet mm take risk profits go mm case tokens maturity date need repaid full boom call option buy xyz price later see 
354989,
354990,added example
354991,usually gamble takes place
354992,people always smug threatening tone sit well people
354993,basically 8% current circulating supply im curious hacker sell decide get active governance
354994,
354996,yes know want terms precise deal 2 min ago part collectivism kek
354997,ah deal wasnt made w dao seems terms private op wintermute
354999,instead wintermute dumping hacker dumped what's difference
355000,20 mill
355001,hacker dumps less
355003,1m far
355004,bullish
355005,nono u got wrong specific foundation business dao loan
355006,hence voting companys tokens
355007,
355008,fine fine still
355009,get
355010,hopium much lol 
355011,discretionary business still sowwy
355012,entertaining outcome
355013,itd much lulz bro becomes delegator
355014,sometis
355015,wait wrong
355017,discovered issue launch
355018,that's crazy part scrap token start deployment makes sense
355019,sort private transaction submission system existed op
355020,20m sitting blockchain waiting someone take cant make 
355021,
355022,nice thread
355023,sure noone else could open gnosis contract
355024,wow really crazy huge fuck everyone involved
355025,like scheduled retrieval mean even think others recover funds immediately
355026,wow wow
355027,
355028,discovering would super easy hindsight huge token holder eoa
355029,check mainnet activity realize gnosis safe
355030,contracts created address different chains completely different code result completely different owners possible see attacks using vector future
355031,may thought need access private key original creator eoa case create use current nonce address factory compute address multisig
355035,dont want open worms really exploit address one chain mean rights every chain 
355036,smart contracts address eoa
355037,what's point sending test txs assert move tokens receiving address
355038,funny thing 2 test txs
355039,may verifier didnt switch optimism gnosis ui checking
355040,
355041,back thesis
355042,tokens wallet sent another wallet someone steal keys basically sent open access wallet
355043,dont understand tokens send already created smartcontracthow even possible someone finds controlledcreated contract
355044,im interested optics semantics really happened wintermute screwed bad theyre masquerading attackexploit sent something wrong address basically
355045,assume every address smartcontract already thereright
355046,nah kinda owned blockminded
355047,send tokens address think
355048,correct address open access one even bigger blunder wrong address might better
355049,yeah wintermute owning optimism spinning different narrative
355050,sounds like wintermute optimistic optimism wintermute
355051,think clearly theft exploit another question analogy leaving bag money around seems apt
355052,bet since many educated enough understand difference eo sc across chains
355053,need draw attention away fact already knew airdrop anyways
355054,gave facts loser wintermute thats
355055,buy back safu
355056,every wallet dapp analytics must consider general case address multiple chains owned different owners edge case
355057,except dmg done token price due people selling news
355058,contracts regular addresses
355059,who's going buy back
355060,sir definitely makes op loser optics front could avoided creating new token drop
355061,didnt leave bag money around openthey delivered wrong house saying guy receiving keep also dont think painted hackerman
355062,hacker ends selling
355063,influence governance 
355064,true contacts regular eoa addr
355065,even really hacker
355066,safe setup frontrunner
355068,yes put contract address debank show full portfolio single owner
355069,actually interesting discussion owns address anything deployed
355070,agree think even less clear ndx thing
355071,
355072,possession 910ths law old saying goes interesting situation crypto never disappoints new problems lol
355073,maybe problems never problem first place
355074,technically address private key able sign transactions contracts deployed address suppose private key wont valid brute forcing private key impossible though
355075,someone usually canary coal mine though next guy make blunder
355078,forta airdrop token wallets solved ethernaut ctf challenges also qualify 
355079,else
355080,forta contributors gnosis safe active signers
355081,
355082,never dull day
355083,aka got found gib back funds
355084,
355085,omfg
355086,real eyes realize real lies
355087,burned 10m dai
355088,quantitative tightening
355089,holy shat
355090,got back tho 
355091,today definitely crazy day maybe one craziest
355092,clown day fr wintermute gets frontrun safe firestake accidentally hack instead audit kaineth accidentally burns 10m ready mainstream adoption anon
355094,going post firestake mentioned bad new web3 lingo exploting bugs providing family rugging learning founders ghosting decentralizing
355095,kain makereao recovered 10m dai back
355096,put new bad context
355097,early 
355099,good stuff side ropsten merge gitcoin grants round 14 started took shower
355100,impressed point 3 personally i'm still working
355102,tokens sent address accounting update token contract matter contract exists
355103,nice song sung yes posted engagement bait y'all 
355104,wait thought contract addresses derived deployer key nonce
355105,tech explanation op hickup 
355106,4 took picture birds
355107,that's contract addresses deployed eoa contracts created factory
355108,ah right that's missing ty
355109,
355110,damn really called volt wonder affect fei stablecoin name
355111,mega mind hacker heck knew likely hoping something like happen waiting already
355112,volt cpi pegged inflation resistant token
355113,yeah market stable coin
355114,anyone know switched factory using create2 deployments default
355115,tbh sitting 9 days guess people black hats lot alarms systems place nudge juicy rewards
355116,many people interested airdrop probably found checking holder checking address possibly mainnet
355117,wild stuff wintermute scheduled date recover assets instead actually
355118,optimism launching new token
355119,wild guess incorrectly thought create2 rush still
355120,launching new token might hard definitely ideal since gave magic address sure works
355121,checklists important
355122,dunno personally prefer 8% supply magic address
355123,hypothetically exactly networkupgrade tokens away 
355124,op ded devs something 
355125,good question think making op wallet becoming soulbound 
355126,100% sure nodes based geth ethereum nodes bytecode contracts guess override diff bytecode removes balance attacker probably think like erc20 upgrade node level optimism runs nodes moment shoudlnt difficult local update infra ethereum similar change would mean hard fork probably missing details
355128,could probably introduce new state root altho optimism promised regenesis
355129,hi
355130,funny thing think elrond hack earlier week without blinking 
355131,lmao hacker sent another 1m op vitalik
355132,network upgrade stfu try deal situation stop saying stupid stuff twitter 
355133,yeah i'm looking forward article explaining happened

355145,blv u retain rights anything u write medium
355146,looked problem inside yearn got explanation issue assuming banteg knew already childish
355147,think concept flashloans makes sense considering elrond works fundamentally different ethereum
355148,think might misunderstanding seems b4ds3ct0r referring hacker banteg
355149, hacker suspected something like could happen already prepared
355150,dunno though
355151,yes that's meant thank clarifying
355152,sorry misunderstanding bad
355153,hey guys quick question found bunch old walletdat idea blockchain they're related back day rather downloading bitcoin core litecoin core core world tool somewhere could tell blockchain they're addresses privkeys they're likely empty they're student time i'm curious still
355154,try open walletdat notepad check contents search 'name' string wallet address somewhere nearby
355155,wait walletdat raw binary lol
355156,cant believe never tried inspect contents

355197,theory cant make stablecoin regulator compliant fully backed blscklist wrapper doesnt blacklist isnt scheme censorship resistant
355198,lets see airdrop one psyops
355199,think blacklist also feature makes reg compliant
355200,yeah thats make usdf blacklist wusdf locks usdf doesnt blacklist
355201,tldr making reg compliant orthogonal censorship resistance inherit flaws dollar
355202,oh interesting else erc 20 requires censorship resistant apart blacklist
355203,i'm convinced usdt tether audit treasury publicly share funds held huge security risk usdt assets we're held us bank account us government easily freeze seize usdt treasury whenever want making onchain assets valueless lot us crypto first began using we've screwed bank past rely longer
355204,bytecodehash none

355268,ah might one 
355269,
355270,i'm make global crypto want biggest impact good
355271,let algos 
355272,thoughts 
355273,amazing bancor successfully branded pool2s il protected
355274,bnt get exploited mean
355275,bnt bancor's governance token gets paired every asset listed bancor bnt declines assets paired lps suffer il
355276,yes i'm aware token i'm asking go exploiting said token
355277,think author tweet meant protocol gets exploited leads token price crashing malicious actor dumps massive amount bnt initiating death spiral nothing seems impossible crypto anymore lol
355278,manipulate price arb token large pools across multiple dexes guess though would expect sufficient protections
355279,manipulation going wrong direction drop price bnt get less tokens paired bancor need artifically inflate price bnt use bnt cheap swap tokens
355280,i'm expert may totally missing something seems like wrong direction death spiral
355281,could infinite mint bnt could theoretically drain liquidity since everything paired bnt big though
355282,token xyz paired bnt bnt drops relative xyz il xyz check calculations drop price token b keeping token price
355283,
355284,sounds like llama pay shite brand attached
355285,lol
355286,
355287,dex liquidity range uni v3
355288,orcas launched whirlpool concentrated liquidity functionality iirc
355289,nft component sounds like pulled stuff we've built revest nonexistent ui
355290,comparison back
355291,gonna wait samczsun ask theyre
355292,feel like capital provided front furo isnt best design
355293,anyone llamapay revest fnftlinked smart wallets would allow yall pretty easily replicate streamtransferability functionality without requiring corecode changes work
355294,hey i'm llamapay
355295,well awesome dm
355296,what's great say easy build things top like mentioned
355297,3 contradict 4 furo
355298,agree start date future good fixed duration also good also infinite duration
355300,yeah manually prolong think llama need anything except periodically topping pot streams
355301,kyber single sided liq know allowed concentrated liq thought added pool
355303, hop claim live
355304,understanding way works create stream 2 months provide money needed 2 months starts ending add tokens another 2 months thus extend requires periodic actions stream llamapay works directly pulling money pool shared streams need top runs low
355306,like balancer lbp's
355308,different tradeoffs furo's system makes easy add yield top since money stream fixed going single person defillama pooled nature funds makes much harder feature
355309,imo furo compare favorably others sushi paints built ape sdk llamapay big oofs noticed different units depositwithdraw abstracted sdkfrontend anyway feature deposit behalf payer
355313,requires bit different building blocks plan provide yearn inferno details found 
355315,p2e
355316,thinking depositing money aave keep collateral interest streamed
355318,could big issue aave interest fixed variable stream speed would constantly change would require txs
355321,p2e market issue whole crypto market's fill one's fridge sell ethbitcoin fiat
355322,vast majority bnt locked amm north 80% actually owned bancor protocol bnt used support trading liquidity token side deposits protocol never actively sells bnt means little bnt compared protocol owns outside markets used drop price bnt token
355325,talking death spiral question insinuating scenario likely

355334,
355335,many gb space storing ethereum active addresses balance take node let's say eoas 5gb 10gb 25gb 100gb 
355336,depends client
355337,i'm sure think particularly clear since balances part state
355338,multiple levers help us manage il risk protocol level tokens listed bancor get different amounts trading liquidity based risk profiles easily grow shrink liquidity pools order control much il exposing protocol protocol providing trading liquidity also earning fees portion stake tokens bancor paired bnt means half fees earned go towards bnt side pool protocol earns trading fee revenue bnt uses cover il suffered lps withdrawal note pools experience il fact many pools profitable use cover il experience pools separately take 15% swap fee revenue vortex burner burns vbnt vbnt represents locked bnt protocol supports trading liquidity applies deflationary measures bnt token consider insurance premium il protection providing version 3 protocol 25% security fee withdrawal use replenish pools deficit tokens essentially use open arbitrage opportunity outsider supply us tokens deficit therefore guarantee higher probability receive tokens plus fees withdrawal token deposited

355346,yea thread also included mm issue known quite time strange disabled
355349,they're kinda different though ecdsa nonce reuse metamask letting sign transactions masqueraded messages
355351,also related reuse ecdsa nonces resulted anyswap drained last year
355353,interacting malicious contract typically minimal impact unless something like rune
355354,signing transaction masquerading message depends transaction
355355,account necessarily drained anyway limited one tx
355356,accounts derived seed also unaffected

355398,apps allowed use crypto cut apple pay harder get mainstream crypto adoption without
355399,goes well could also sell laptops desktops
355400,without 300k phone
355401,thats make status symbol apple
355402,pretty sure metamask mobile ios still built browser
355403,ponzinomics
355404,vertu phones supposed status symbol uh actually one
355405,right apple doesnt allow apps pay crypto web3 browser metamask clunky 3rd party dapps compared normal native apps
355406,various price points bored apes one extreme example
355407,know need download apps app store
355408,yes many
355409,exactly
355411,right first small market flagship show bored apes phone 100x status symbol apple
355412,likelihood bored ape phone propose gonna android phone made chinese oem cringe theme
355413,doesnt
355414,problem buying paintjpgs phone app store instead either using app store phone without wallet garden proposal entirely new phone costs 300k narrative fighting cefi phones
355415,would lol
355423,name indian company going release cellphonepoint sale system
355424,idk one many try many things eventually win right model etc another problem solved web3 dapps clunky compared native apps phone comes nft worth roughly pay price youre paying 3300k nothing expensive nfts doesnt make cefi nfts would cefi
355425,big mc phone size 1986 cellphone ugh can't remember
355428,product alternative app store ton
355429,end back chinese oem phone custom branding thing
355436,use existing tech maybe ui innovation new models incremental improvement use high quality components features
355437,heh realize things least problems trying sell new phone quite surprise
355439,samsung phone cryptocurrency wallet preinstalled think demand
355440,must fail pretty sure thats social networks google etc tech history unfolded failed none made forever founder energy
355441,ya wasnt right model apparently
355443,nobody saying impossible sell crypto jpeg'er 10m phone going crypto payments dead definitively
355444,yeah made big pr push one cared
355445,999999% youre saying nft crypto app payments 8k growing user base dedicated pays exorbitant prices things uphold multi trillion crypto market 8k sounds low guess optimism makes sense long term
355446,especially consider already possible people make crypto payments buy nfts etc phone still get fancy apple ecosystem stuff
355447,oh apparently samsung flagships come inbuilt blockchain wallet
355449,unfortunately math fewer 8b use phone even fewer smartphone even fewer might care feature would able afford device even fewer need exactly zhongfu explained
355451,think main issue thing justification status symbol wrap lambo stickers favourite jpeg still valuable lambo without sticker average car market care status symbol jpeg
355452,status symbol last time saw heard someone vertu phone
355453,buy lambo bit limited addition ape lambo bad example already status symbol phone isnt much adding high price tag make one
355456,vertu probably one successful examples they're somehow still around two decades
355457,nope resale value maybe one two buy that's create market brand
355458,saying paying exorbitant pricetag amount something become obsolete less 5 years make much sense
355459,expensive watches sure like they'll become useless solid gold iphones
355460,caviar like word
355461,royal oak szn
355463,8k crypto holders even 1k crypto holders buy newfangled phone use dead store pay crypto problem 999999%
355464,think solid gold iphones bit different nfts nft based product argument brand value nfts give price inherent value material used
355474,material used concern tbh solid gold iphone valuable iphone that's wrapped gold many countries outside western ones iphone status symbol wrapping gold enhances wrapping chinese oem gold value
355476,yeah birth certificate showing i'm bill gates' grandson
355477,really sure much trust software qa new phone discord gets hacked monthly
355487,see issue right player apple decided release 10k pfp series apples random size bite marks came 10k phones replaces apple logo one nft associated probably hit
355489,can't said nft native brand access amount infrastructure
355490,described working high end phone connect android play store also app store allows native crypto nft slick apps comes branded tradable valuable nft eg bayc justify high price phone high end must non functional

355581,core cpi 6% april core fundamentally matters policy decisions
355582,doesnt change fact user needs get back actual asset though
355583,liquidator actually act trader
355584,luquidators usually dont get rid positions instantly arbitragers nature
355585,
355586,
355587,also true pretty much everywhere euler specific
355588,korpi87 reply ser good thread btw
355589,true compound im pretty sure therefore true lending protocols
355590,ah oke thanks correcting anyway aave major liquidity source 2b
355591,user 50% position liquidated lose 50% collateral 50% debt dont need get back actual asset liquidator euler takes board debt collateral epecially useful think collateral valued steth case debt overvalued case short squeeze
355592,mean depositors lp side need asset threw whats different sorry slow
355593,way understand liquidator decide prefund liquidation essentially take steth balance sheet well marketbuy
355594,excellent thread
355595,dont need asset threw need collateral could usdc whatever
355596,liquidators account like lending borrowing account
355597,wait wdym deposit usdc euler want usdc back
355598,u cant decide give eth back threw usdc
355599,youre still thinking loan repaid liquidator taking loan
355600,liquidator deposits 1000 usdc
355601,ah okok got thanks correcting liquidator market buy asset consider undervalued
355602,aave also take whole debtcollateral position account liquidation 
355603,boils strategy liquidator
355604,yup wondering whats unique per se ofc cool liquidator small brain assumed arbitrageur cantshouldnt expect take balance sheet risks deciding asset good hold usually get rid within minute
355605,yep seems euler strategy
355606,yes think technicalities apart
355607,well think wethsteth case probably worth liquidators take risk
355608,liquidators swap adverse liquidity conditions means slippage high gas fees exchange costs often much preferable take debt wait mean reversion definitely market risk often worth

355686,yield dovs yield trading one direction goes far losing
355687,cool thank ser noob question mind let's say want chain analysis iterating contract deployments extracting cfgs wrote code ropstein using erigon wanted scale mainnet archive using geth would rewrite lot code
355688,i'm sure exactly erigon works worried would start scratch wanted scale
355689,mainnet disk requirements much bigger
355690,hm mean apy number shown ribbon misstatement projected profit calculated based covered call strategy
355691,that's fine concerned dev time code reuse
355692,apy projected based premium collected last 4 weeks assuming options expire money options expire itm dont see loss apy see historical chart performed
355693,gotcha makes sense sorry potentially stupid question option premium based certain parameters volatalityperceived risk ribbon charge preset percentage 1% 2% wasnt able verify premium something auction price found eth covered calls sure helps
355694,options strike price set distance 10% price premium determined auctioning options
355695,usually option pricing calculated using black scholes function certain parameters ie expiry strike price spot price risk free rate implied volatility estimation volatile case ribbon dovs trade actually made trough auction thats premium collected

355701,thx docs quite well written refreshingly different gitbook copypasta lots thoughtful considerations design
355702,many validators exit per day unlock happens many eth unlocked daily
355703,still undetermined i'd love hear others heard withdrawal queue currently designed last many months 3

355705,3 conservative number remember i've heard 6 months 1yr thrown around casually
355706,3 validator 96 eth day
355707,think possible devs staker side client teamsef achieve respec
355708,know number eth
355709,like queue full perpetually many months normal conditions currently designed meaning new withdrawals wait least long cooldown period unless redesign occurs might happen know public start discussing merge
355710,find plz share around various docsforums remember want misquoting

355715,900 validators day memory exit queue entry queue numbers
355716,yeah correct
355717,know cfg guess want extract info deployments depends going make using standard interfaces might work reading directly erigon db definitely different clients use different db formatssolutions
355718,lido devs coredev working various ways reduce queue former different schemes obviate need regular key rotation
355719,latter ways make queue larger without sacrificing security economic guarantees
355720,that's minimum goes minimum based active validators
355721,
355722,remember exact number extrapolating existing staker key rotation needs queue could full quite awhile withdrawals enabled
355723,1k rightnow remember exact number
355724,nice thx looking something like

355818,usdc risky corporate bonds composition contrast usdt
355819,yep
355820,around 5% usdt bit less annoying corporate bonds secured loans funds others assets including crypto
355822,fractional reserve much bigger profitable business
355823,paxos usdpbusdhusd guess
355824,retarded concept negative interest rates also another concept paying salaries people generally possible cover fees esp dealing mountains regulator imposed paperwork legaleze
355825,holding massive amounts fiat others incredibly expensive scale

355834,yeah yet another vc influencoooor
355836,vance framework kinda ethfriendlyfans comparing 2 assets shows ignorance maybe stressed cause coins r worth 0
355837,means goes well
355838,thanks response
355839,trustwallet mean says replacement transaction underpriced need change order cancel tx
355840,im putting gas pending tx sure cant
355841,need either send tx nonce higher gwei
355842,send transaction wallet 0 eth nonce higher gwei
355843,thats im still saying underpriced
355844,even put numbers way higher get error
355845,nonce
355846,yea nonce watever tx went thru 1hr still wierd couldnt cancel
355847,good reads state storage ethereum
355848,heding steth without eth exposure euler 
355850,haha
355852,soon integrating euler ser 
355853,wtf market works
355854,worst price risk
355855,
355857,talking blockchain solidity
355858,thats works calling risks leveraged staking long time ago always said countertrade option otherwise get unsustainable bubbles always get popped youre blaming wrong person think bad blame people encouraged leveraged staking low risk high reward blame people disabled steth shorting encourage bubble
355859,explain data smart contracts stored blockchain low level
355861,state smart contracts
355862,explain eth clients store state
355863,yes agreed move slowly think thats feature bug btw
355866,trading zerosum thing great timing whats good one person bad another vice versa
355868,meant moving slowly carefully feature bug ie team doesnt ape latest high yield trend
355870,treasury bonds cash better usdc usdt sure
355871,paxos claims otherwise think sec edit bad tbills
355872,hi might interesting 
355873,mean timing strategy month anyone use
355876,doubt thai website list targeted industries doesnt include blockchaincrypto digital seems internet things etc probably wont qualify startup smart visa knows maybe worth applying taking chance
355877,around time yes years work get euler full operation though hardly like timed certainly dancing graves think markets free fair healthy markets need long shorts banning shorting always leads worse outcomes market always finds way whats happening hasnt fair market
355878,well tbh market dancing graves efficient market point lead mass graveyards
355880,accelerating would collapsed anyway
355881,basic take omfg
355883,lets trade one loses money mr
355885,cant survive maybe mechanism ready careful break stuff stress test everything worst scenarios
355886,euler doesnt centralized platform profit someone capitalize
355889,whole idea creating defi anti fragile systems
355894,thats people got leveraged
355895,ones leveraged might get liquidated
355896,making space less risky players
355899,irrational expectance
355900,built leveraged people expectations 
355901,people decide risk investments
355904,people bought someone shilled
355905,get rekt
355906,mature market
355907,well market matures id guess
355908,real data points statement
355910,system way building something fix people buying shills thats bad thing lol
355913,sir propose solution waiting
355914,nice tinfoil hat
355915,fits well
355918,shilling side trade saying eulers fault mate
355919,institutionsmoney players behave market markets manipulation least risk assets
355922,isnt market manipulation 
355923,
355924,seems basic differences building
355927,
355928,think alejo talking ethosideals markets work
355929,normal people
355930,pretty surprised there's actually amount retail steth besides defi degens always knew risk chose ignore
355932,anyone know using multisig bridge multichain issues
355934,think willful ignorance entitles riskfree profitmaking endeavors
355936,yes
355938,i'm one trying shirk personal responsibility
355939,celsius problem tho celsius taking risks client fund celsius' responsibility market's
355941,market functioning like market bad effect
355943,logic sellers blacklisted
355945,what's manipulation tho like whale wallets steth hidden public
355947,retail volume nearly enough
355948,would retail look buy market trend
355949,manipulated tops bottoms since beginning retail come there's uptrend
355951,imo crypto markets kinda sham point direction decided entirely insiders retail accelerate trend
355952,
355953,normal people retail profit profit get rekt let's nuanced discussion responsible losses deposited money thing
355954,lmao
355956,sure fancy appearances methinks maybe stop putting money things rekt attacked profit
355958,see soros jail pound
355960,yeah i'm sure people thinking others profit
355962,nuanced discussions blame profitmaking attempt goes splat
355964,like strawmen
355966,im technolog szn
355968,topic generating profits anyone used yet
355969,true
355970,need work yoga stretches think hold steth use leverage gonna break back form
355971,sign money 
355973,
355974,actually one kek gotta find wallet
355975,ok fin take dms
355976,wen private grp
355977,selling lobster dao paid group nfts make back
355978,alreadye xists
355980,ser pls invite need make back luna
355985, fine ill moderate
355986,get ugly nft pinned message link
355988,thought lobsters would like idk
355989,sources show much miner earned priority tx fees per block
355990,etherscan shows burnt gas fees much earned priority 
355991,2 1405656141591472817 13145081184641833
355992,see fees burned 13145081184641833 ether based avg 43 gwei fee one assumes priority fees defaulted 1 gwei would safe assume priority fees earned 13145 eth 43 003 eth
355993,2 block reward 14056 tx fees including base tip 13145 basefees
355994,take total miner reward subtract block reward thing
355995,oh see block reward line
355996,009 priority fee thanks
355997,curious priority fee block reward go away post merge priority fees continue distributed validator assigned block
355998,specific goes fee recipient necessarily validator
355999,attestation proposal rewards get added validator balance priority fee goes fee recipient address
356000,true though id imagine validators greedy regard lol
356001,yes precisely makes running something like rocketpool bit attractive post merge node operator would earn priority fees
356002,get propose block guess lol
356003,running 2 rpl nodes instead 1 solo one would earn 2x priority fees though would rare much could add time
356004,right currently get 1 block ever 4 5 weeks
356005,get 009 per 5 weeks thats shabby
356006,get 018 every 5 weeks thats even better
356008,yeah shabby actually that's like extra 59% apr
356009,also rocketpool team considering lowering barrier entry 50% node supply 16 eth perhaps 25% 8 eth plus 10% equivalent rpl one would go 1 solo 4 rpl nodes
356010,009 036 eth
356011,back napkin math
356012,makes seem surface anyway attractive
356013,additional risk rocketpool contract attack surface opposed solo time merge happens fairly well battle tested though major vulnerabilities likely wouldnt seen withdrawals enabled
356014,
356015,they're planning ways force node operators setting fee recipient rpl fee distributed fairly still consideration since earn least much fees avg running rpl node opposed solo 2 nodes 50% still get 50% 2x fees 100% plus % 50% one solutions would redistribute fees straight back withdrawal address attractive still something considering
356016,damn im super ngmi
356017,
356022,
356023,cool stats overall
356024,teddywoodward ser risks taking 1 cant liquidated since lending 2 anyone else liquidated must hope done time asset composition major assets right 3 slippage entry 4 nothing else know curve changes norepayments seniority occuring lender take
356025,always contract vulnerability risks potential opportunity costs
356026,yup ofc always vague given didnt feel need reask
356027,
356029,whats honeypot
356031,new chain tvl 100k
356032,please give concrete info larp ser
356033,meneedyields blz
356034,direction matter
356035,yes ofc dont understand mrkwhg trying say
356037,next time ban larp shittery
356038,especially considering streak
356039,probably looked either new masterchef shitcoin pool 2 apr first day new chain 100k usd tvl total
356040,bleh either throw sayonara
356042, increase lt steth 90% theyre pushing celsius unwind position making steth depeg bigger risk factor
356043,want steth holders draw eth support peg way makes aave
356044,aave parameter hm interesting tho wouldnt expect move
356045,thats poor r
356046,pause eth borrowing lt changed preventing existing positions increasing risk exposure required would need prevent new eth borrows opened almost eth borrowing recursive borrowing limited demand eth borrow still something users want
356047,doesnt really help indeed makes situation worse
356048,protocol wouldnt able unwind anyway since forced measure whats use
356049,help modern robin hood settle better sure otc deal celsius
356051,meme ok kingdom 3
356052,lol ftx hate unfounded imo blame poorly managed ust risk celsius deflection makes sense
356053,seems like hoping depeg wont fall 20% said breathing room anything else unwind happens way quicker threshold reached
356054,agree celsius' behavior egregious musnt forget playing user funds liqing celsius hurts general population 'bad celsius management' story whole ustluna unwind kwon still filthy rich probably
356055,lol can't believe people bootlicking celsius dude acting like non profit organization needs saved people make mistakes accept consequences poor risk management acting like risk free nobody owes anything seeing uponly mechanics wrong providing tools help bring systemic risk back equilibrium
356056,think beautiful see defi wear like whether terra celcius ftx whoever events nature healing need exploits lawsuits perfect space
356057,none 3 entities mentioned called defi
356058,lawsuits perfect space lol
356059,yes ftx celsius clearly decentralized
356060,wanna create world ecosystem finance back people literally screened risk taking behavior inherently inevitable space make mistakes people learn hopefully help others repeating mistakes world works literally cannot linear growth undertaking systemic changes
356061,protect people let em whatever want full freedom implies protection usually vs protect selfpolice otherwise regs fuck us lets try radiate virtue
356062,done know arguments lets please engage mental masturbation
356063,yeah still two risks smart contract risk economic risk positions dont get liquidated time could protocol insolvency use conservative assets risk parameters decent reserve buffer final thing lend one year period three months wont able exit june maturity roll sep maturity roll wont able take cash
356064,conclusion
356065,obvious ser
356066,bag go embrace yolo bag go call gary gensler
356067,like whether like say anyway personal choice believe full freedom better cause protection always goes wrong
356068,btw whats rationale letting take principal still stays barrier curious second take means sell position open market w slippage entailed actually withdraw wo slippage
356069,first yeah basically maintain liquid 3 month 6 month one year markets skip 9 month avoid fracturing liquidity much cant take youre falling 9 month gap becomes tradable next quarterly roll second yes youre correct trading slippage withdrawing
356070,new 1yr market ser
356071,yup new one opens automatically roll next one june 2023
356072,wait wdym want lend yearly one ui doesnt show
356073,
356074,fresh press mostly obvious stuff good scroll
356075,yeah want lend lend june 22 sep 22 mar 23 wait june maturity weeks able lend sep 22 dec 22 jun 23

356086,sure joking serious 
356088,hello support may trying borrow much steth drop discord help figure currently queue binance thing consensus time hands little
356089,what's best way identify ponzis like leveraged staking borrowed eth steth feels like good amount money made bullrun
356090,leveraged steth farming ponzi
356092,celsius unloading anything else particular caused candles regular bear stuff
356093,rumor celsius sold steth discount alameda
356094,thus alameda hedging aggro eth perps
356095,shown oi increase
356096,hi guys check total eth liquidation value maker 
356097,
356098,lmfao
356099,ok good thing ditching dapp terminology dwa

356102,try ledu regret
356104,jai good story telling rari cofounders legit fucked tribe leaving right merger
356105,tt added recently another way look data 
356106,core protocols defi general crypto exists tradition finance welllike lending borrowing staking protocols like farming exist traditional finance right
356107,kinda roboadvisorsbut 11 given platforms dont give farmable rewards siloed
356108,better leave stay sabotage
356109,seems parallel discord hacked
356110,yes indeed
356111,think like quite understand riskreward rule nature
356112,
356113,tokens bad set life ofc lol immutability fetish seems new trend started andre got set life next thing jai work defi regulation
356114,andre reasons burned hard jay wasnt market long enough imho dont know liked story wrote seems like weak
356115,yes indeed usual trajectory 1 embrace freedom gamble safe financial future 11 failed start hating freedom embrace regulation people wont take money anymore 12 succeeded peace become happy 13 succeeded peace embrace regulation nobody takes money
356116,always respect fellow watchmen 
356117,yeah andre probably needed breal jais story mix autobiography andres latest articles understandable since likes forking probably also looks andre way
356118,agree
356119,study community managers web3 better understand responsibilities tools used pain points would love connect community managers open sharing experiences perspectives reciprocate sharing aggregate insights done feel free dm
356120,interesting
356121,biggest pain point bots scammers
356122,biggest pain point dealing invested fudders might asking legit questions 
356123,project x keeps giving announcements integrations price going u mean
356124,easy ban really interested start community process making project decentralised
356125, bad idea talk try reason empower suggest changes direction stage peacefully fk cause r usually larps
356126,come back new account trust community management hardest job lol
356127,onboard next billion users banning couple hundred wont hurt right
356128,oh rly
356129,work full time mod
356130,even bad rr
356131,mod hire please
356132,reason think optics
356133,entire space optics narratives still
356134,point announcement announcement fact couple days back ive seen announcement isnt even announcement announcement 
356135,even cryptodefi authoritarian beliefs
356136,fork community bro
356137,frontend decentralised
356138,1 discuss civilized way make sure fud addressed everyone see 2 either happy least act constructively 3 case disrupt 24h mute 4 continue 24h perma mute
356139, alex food plate next bera
356140,banning general makes little sense put people readonly people mental issues require muted disturb others
356141,basically said extra steps
356142,crypto based open discussion open source code open access user game theorise correctly bad actors much abuse open access
356144,need chat use app
356145,lol let try
356146,extra steps important ban outright go martyr mode rally people around victim narrative strong
356147,give much credit
356148,capable created monster good industry overall
356149,ivangbi group analytics since market top frequency chats ppl leavingjoining would cool check since nft drop lobsters kind became mainstream
356150,less effort think usually point addressed anyway point towards time chat see building knowledge base faq within telegram
356151,community brand dont differentiate brand die easiest way differentiate barriers entry
356152,ideally sure doesnt really work way practice
356153,good question actually top tier devs left scene became less active general burned defi devs summer even active much twitter anymore either exited noise period back decided turn social exposure cause stress newcomers getting educated washed dont stand strong new founders 10x x years lower noise lower scam easier conversations
356154,imho
356155,done 4 years heights 201718 bull full bear also consider users actually willing engage project rare people initially fud behaving weirdly become strongest allys general drive waste time chatroom
356156,bit longer disagree
356157,projects listed binance cos cohort different
356158,yes standard ico
356159,would still ban free create community follow twitter learn
356160,thats real decentralisation
356161,general drive waste time chatroom register effort real fudder
356162,imo daos community overrated rn projects focusing community pump tvl price instead product validate pmf first
356163,thats cos ppl like alex dont ban lmao
356164,turbo ban everyone first sight able make distinction whos real fudder
356165,makes communities bloated mercenaries
356166,means brand suck
356167,
356168,worse falls apart quite spectacularly number goes longer interested pretending good community member
356169,toxic people still mute course worth engage least
356170,average iq goes wayyyy community gets certain size
356171,dont know culling controversial
356172,low iq problem set rules main room direct spammerslow iq people sort party room
356173,moderate iron first ban much delete lot mute subsequently keep offending
356174,trend see communities becoming smaller smaller
356175,eventually replacing core teams
356176,thats sustainable way buidl
356177,personally autoban largely amusement half decade doubt outcome practically different
356178,outcome
356179,frontrun badness
356180,im actually sure something like ohms community effectively managed
356181,ppls emotions gets going hard stop momentum
356182,ban basically hostile passive someone sacharine polite answering questions also helps call bit behaviour time performance never dealing everyone else rally dog pile may know user good rest community may understand view actions lens banning reasonable user even clearly shit stirring creates headache alienates users rather inviting
356183,maybe failed build worthwhile community first place massive issues
356184,exclusive one community sure
356185,ethereum community
356186,tg splinter ethereum community
356187,there's nothing particularly special
356188,isnt ethereum stronk
356189,banning ez way community management effort effort includes dealing ppl otherwise frustrating upset unable regulate
356190,simplistically numba go woo numba go whip 
356191,big already yes even community devs
356192,guess find years time communities actually matter
356193,yeh community devs
356194,immutability fetish read example 
356195,exceptions seen project even people get banned still
356196,remember cryptomedicated anyone lol
356197,model communities
356198,take tokenomics get thru year 1 pmf year 2 community year 3
356199,oh movie moonfall
356200,would change 2 3 otherwise maybe ye

356255,hello gentlemen i've working project wanted market research think place opensource etl tool querying transforming filtering saving evm based chaindata tool works completely jsonrpc api means evm chain archive api work evm data currently limited historical realtime events method calls blocks transactions added future first draft documentation feedback would greatly appreciate maybe dm clutter chat docs apollochainboundio
356256,sounds teeny bit like thegraphgraph protocol
356257,that's true difference bit granular control data want anything abi queried graph protocols build subgraphs also there's need indexing lot easier go multi chain
356258,another thing graph historical method calls let's say want call balanceof erc last 6 months certain account able
356259,could write subgraph indexes start indexing whatever block want long archive node
356260,think something else works well erigon can't recall top head
356261,build szn kindddd
356262,one thing would request data output come directly platforms use right would pay top dollars tableau bridge nobody set one
356263,that's true quick research projects like might make lot sense mean trueblocks
356265,ah yeah

356319,yea thats wrong
356320,vitalik also tweet thread topic
356321,interesting think security properties ends much i'm saying
356322,want argue whether favorite l2 secure favorite alt l1 means that's
356323,
356324,argument security properties tokens end happens chain tokens sent
356325,that's certainly argument
356326,one particular interest
356328,well specific tokens isnt
356329,hey guys looking independent blockchain security auditor experience soliditytruffleopenzeppelinevm chains take look crosschain yield aggregator project zorrofinance launch anyone could recommend talking
356330,context can't yet afford prices certik peckshield etc 100k thus want start 1 2 independent auditors
356331,let's pivot discussion local crime rates talking inherent safety flying
356332,yeah completely unrelated didnt read discussion
356333,wanted disagree vitalik
356334,hehe

356337,please ctrlf would make u scroll back quite bit find
356338,convo mention certik suggest reading back quite bit 3
356339,agree fwiw describing oddity led link even showing would happen multichain gotten exploited 
356340,thanks gone previous posts wanted see new recommendations come totally fair go old posts
356342,sure youre understanding argument security risk token bridged altl1 exist tokens bridged fully functional rollup 1 deposit x tokens bridge contract mainnet 2 x tokens minted altl1 3 mainnet gets reorged without inclusion deposit transaction x less tokens bridge contract tokens altl1 means tokens altl1 got rekt
356343,discussing tokens ser dont understand comment
356344,original question coiner replied
356345,think reorgs exploited bridge tokens
356346,tokens l2 inherit security l1 tokens
356347,
356349,please coiner figure argument actually go dms bloody confusing cant understand anything
356350,ser 
356351,kinda difficult someone refuses join good faith discussion fair enough dropping
356355,lasseclausen effectively 3 times cheaper case pay via nxm size
356356,100kis average per audit would say could higher

356372,running graph node probably good
356373,yeah allergic graph need simple daemon

356419,either say anything using cel
356420,i'd guess way play new information
356421,guess pausing withdrawals helps avoid running reserves bc much eth versus steth
356422,terra playing money rather playing people's money
356423,cel 70% 
356424,need pause risk making steth position liquidable

357915,sources
357916,bad idea ser 
357917,experience regulators typically power optics relevence leads funding either government levy push onto industry tend agree way effectively try centralise becomes easier collect money enforce code conduct observations time publishing research discussion papers likely decided even everyone pushes back typically ignore first float new code guidance discussion almost always overkill need optics listening pulling back newer industries almost always go fastest car road number 2 3 unless fastest car especially hard pin almost every regulator 3 years behind technology regulate comes crypto opinion started onoff ramp next obvious place centralisation node operators staking pos networks big eth stakers coinbase etc control validation decisions like client pick etc also regulate block ordering lot cases would control ramp customers transaction settlement layer leading enforcable regulation

358257,univ3 twaps expert dont see useful actively traded token since oracles call pools implementation hits line basically swap 10 seconds ago need get even quite small 200 seconds twap wait 190 seconds pass pair actively traded calls would always revert cant use smart contracts get price chain given time
358258, that's one way peg stablecoin suppose
358259,liquity liquidating rekt troves demand ethleverage drying consequences dumb forget dai playbook must similar far liquidate make stability pool liquidations lusd goes price lack needed close positions new troves popping system shrinking get downwards spiral 1 anyhow becoming unsafe depositors lusd shrinks 2 way wait new organic demand minting fee 05% less market price lusd aka must 105 gib riskfree 
358261,lusd needs 105 considered risk free
358262,meant riskfree trade 05% entry fee nowhere else get gib liquidity need wait lusd price 105%
358263,inbetween new entrants willing get old ones need dollarcost repay wrong
358264,havent seen mentioned mim depegged couple hours ago seems getting back 1 piece puzzle folks keep eye
358265,twitter bullshit single borrow loan overcollaterized stablecoin failed moment mim's bad debt huge
358266,nembal convo
358267,maybe took literally believe long lusd greater 1005 would considered riskfree inbetween new entrants willing get old ones need dollarcost repay wrong seems right well new entrants needed arb price difference minting similar rai
358268,spiral looks like normal shrinking
358269,spiral meaning one wants enter nothing negative system well overcoll
358270,there's memory slot stores latest ticks contract deployment store 1 tick latest user decides spend gas make storage longer store older data
358271,see increasecardinalitynext
358272,troves supply reduction almost 50% last week cr 190 safety reserve seems healthy tasty apr generally seems ok ish think new entrants going lowers ppl move vaults troves
358273,wait 1005 105 believe 105
358274,1 05% 0005 fee rate var 05% 5% according docs example given liquity example borrowing fee stands 05% borrower wants receive 4000 lusd wallet charged borrowing fee 2000 lusd there's also 200 lusd liquidation reserve charge consider
358275,assume lusd dai clone u could degenerate pvp area denial shit buying putting stab pool
358276,usually fee get removed actual supply held away circ supply turn accrual given gov token stakers eventually
358277,uh there's governance liquity
358278,cause overall ltv collateral ratio drop stab pool enough every vault pays liquidation
358279,hmm that's interesting means tiny 05% missing supply
358280,liquity dai clone
358281,ok time go take look

358314,capped ramp2 
358315,care much either way bancor storytelling makes pretty clear understand proposed work
358316,see etherscan links posted people withdrawing less single asset provided given rest bnt happens bnt drops asset lp incentive sell bnt immediately
358317,jus sayin' wat obvious tin happen consider fudd mean right sent last time clearly read 
358318,want argue whether sufficient that's different question pretending consider dubious
358319,need hostility debate governance post convinced death spiral impossible might missing something external impermanent loss protection part allows whitelisting tokens solve problem bnt might dip protects bnt protect lp's singlesided stake bnt
358320,meh talk debating stop clearly intellectually dishonest
358321,i'll give examples one guy puts 851 eth got back 521 eth 1m bnt immediately dumped bnt eth eth whitelisted asset issue lp's token quality bnt trusted quality asset i'm seeing intellectually dishonest actually happening
358322,anyone good resource understanding longshorts crypto market especially derivatives seeing posts amount long positions right essentially collateral even bigger short positions trying wrap head around
358323,listened

358326,jfc people still dont get bancor's il protections pool 2 rebrand
358328,851 eth 521 477 eth
358329,cool bancor's tvl protected
358330,bnt compensated il would everything pulled
358331,total supply keeps dropping due burning mechanism also
358332,btw representative bancor highly suggest ask technical q's 
358333,sir put 1m eth get back half eth half bnt sell bnt back eth get slipped 100% il protection works put 1k sure get slipped
358334,people pulls liq bnt gets printed compensate il dump instantly leading falling price bnt shrinking liquidity inflation convinces people pull bancor death spiral
358335,works put 1 eth get back 1 eth il bnt
358336,least that's worked
358337,works fine small amounts big ones
358338,ok i'll ask bancor tg
358339,millionaires problems also seems
358340,believe way il hope miracle
358341,way accept risks accociated providing liquidity
358343,exactly
358344,well somebody bear cost il
358345,riskreward name game
358346,doubt get honest explanation
358347,i've tried address many times yet hope avoid risks still benefit rewards i'm afraid still present
358348,il protection based onchain mechanism verifiable
358349,clarify larger bags problem shallow liquidity sell pressure sell bnt's exit turn create death spiral
358350,look address getting pools amount mismatches bnt sell
358351,keep finding v21 v3 exits tx url
358353,understand constant talk il protection hard getting algorithmmath behind see cost hidden
358354,always lot talk things 0 substance sortable like 10 minutes either zero sum game shifting il someone else andor ponzi
358355,kinda similar ohm everything fine someone starts pulling big amount system ok similar problem amplified transacted big amounts
358356,33 theoretically ohm supposed floor backed treasury protocol owned liquidity cause drop 0
358357,ohm didnt floor backing mechanism back days though inverse bonds
358358,best dashboard monitoring 
358359,lacking burning though
358360,yes include info calculating circulating supply changes messari accurate tracking afaik
358361,look
358362,yeah total supply decreasing
358363,minted dashboard total supply
358365,vortex burning anywhere enough fees moment keep supply increasing

358898,yes could makes protocol function intended
358899,probably written lens would enough liquidity
358900,enough liquidity handle 150m position hmm
358901,
358902,yes relatively small ecosystem compared ethereum
358903,vincent masterful troll
358904,also markets buying like liquidity even
358905,sure
358906,team protecting solana lender
358907,funny considering stani angel seed investor solend
358908,wouldnt
358909,enough time stealing voting away people's money enough time building means handle liquidation safely
358910,tbh seen yet eth gonna handle 150 mln liquidation yet
358911,wat
358912,well that's bad well lol 
358913,supposed go find otc buyer
358914,put buy order 22 whatever
358915,thats unreasonable
358916,way simulate scenarios
358917,would expect people think worst cases
358918,sure wont react way live market would
358919,course can't wait happens always
358920,people already math around fine
358921,well certain extent liquidations social compotent largely unknown
358922,ah yes unreasonable voting away someone's money
358923,fake dao fake defi fake protocol
358924,overcomplicate
358925,social component people panicking getting
358926,long dont hold ethereum different standards
358927,also we'll liquidate someone 10 price
358928,cares
358929,clearly lmao
358930,chainlink can't even liquidate people multiple times
358931,gonna critical critical
358932,sol vs eth thing solend sucks kinda thing
358933,yeah maybe rally never let liquidation hit tbh eth billions liquidity dexes 150 million theoretically fine
358934,well protocols arent really decentralized thing imo
358935,want try whataboutism least put effort
358936,vote main risks concerned recouping bad debt red something worse
358937,working lol
358938,understood
358939,seems liek community
358940,
358941,that's expecting much someone thinks voting away someone's money unreasonable
358942,pretty sure aware daos chinese democracy
358943,stealing term
358944,guns n roses 
358945,probably strongest group investors solana dapps want solend fail
358946,fail carry actions though
358947,interesting set people
358948,voting away someones money whos putting whole community risk yes
358949,course comrade
358950,1010 times
358951,well come liquidity solution instead taking account
358952,sometimes need show hand protect bags people forget they'll go back talking decentralization lol
358953,allow loan
358954,cause
358955,code
358956,ser
358958,funny require new code deal
358959,bet dollar dime scenario written lending protocols future
358960,supercycle untill ain't
358961,scenario lol
358962,sol rekt market rekt solend rekt
358963,shit new code
358964,lol that's essentially
358965,imagine putting money alameda anything
358966,therell max loans compared available liquidity sort mechanism
358967,like vcs experience lending protocol like share knowledge sth
358968,limit part dao taking account part
358969,kek
358970,write terms service vincent lol
358971,code required
358972,remember thread rooter founder basically saying vcs useless seemed directed investors
358973,next governance proposal coming
358974,genius
358975,angel investor share enough knowledge gets refund capital
358977,
358978,consider checks notes liquidation working always flips page risk bad debt squints existed platforms older solana
358979,want take guess vcs detracted value
358980,well really useless
358981,well need capital one way another either take money vcs raise retail get accused rug time shit happens retail wants upside early investments none risks
358982,since community recommend splitting money half redistributing voters align incentives motivate vote future
358983,much value get simply names front page tends bring crowds even vcs clearly net negative every aspect
358984,blacklist anyone sells airdrops
358985,funny thing doubt would like idk 20% throwing guesstimate gap
358986,everyone could eat 20%
358987,whatever things would okay
358988,determined bad whale putting system risk can't like imagine would happen people vote time right
358989,actually dont think thats crazy thing let happen
358990,course
358991,imagine gets second chance use evil capital place another protocol risk
358992,get liquidate someone liquidation price
358993,indeed think risk
358994,anything find liquidation price slippage would without doubt fuck filling order
358995,20% 223021m
358996,hardly kings ransom
358997,think bigger whales dump solana liq point ensure gets liquidated dao get
358998,gunna otc liquidation maybe like hits price
358999,whale decided cause cascading liquidation send sol 0 onchain that's strategy due bad code community decide deny profit making strategy kinda selfish could 3ac trying earn back 1 trade
359000,potentially
359001,returning ownership money rightf excuse former owner means potentially putting future protocol risk bad whale might even use money set low liquidity dump fund
359002,another fair point ser
359003,take money deter future villains placing system risk way educating users expected behavior win win
359004,one house becoming brothel mean benchmark house need better nuances conscience 1mn voting fake dao defining 270mn wallet behave commit broad daylight robbery
359005,
359006,gonna critical centralization lets forget critical centralization
359007,thats point
359008,there's levels solend took way
359009,like pretend defi better cefi 
359010,anyone knows assange would charged
359011,us gov gets way probably chair
359012,extradited back us
359013,means
359014,face life sentence
359015,
359016,means chair sir
359017,wdym boss chainlink liquidate anyone unless providers run liquidations bots didnt appear apparent far 101 hf position relevant chainlink functioning anywsy
359018,next phase master plan execute order 33 maximum prosperity
359019,every one investors 1000 bags stop thinking investors work pleb thinking helpful end day advice also ignored core devs
359026,somewhere price analysis based historic data previous bear markets trying figure optimal entry point
359029,whats refresh time oracle 5 mins 10 mins
359030,money raised assange dao goes wikileak foundation
359031,official twitter wikileak approved
359032,stop weird shit w ur ponzis sers okay lobsterdao kingdom kinda u scream trading polluting sowwy
359033,tick price change also 
359034,
359035,incredible market makers good
359036,try beat jump wintermute latency wont
359037,can't post media price bottomed 880
359038,liq avoided still confused
359039,someone verify numbers right
359040,impression cause oracle update
359041,someone familiar solana fees
359042,usd oracle looked aave case
359043,eth oracle oracle really update basically overthepricetick kinda
359044,everything worked fine really discrepancy second
359046,aave doesnt use chainlink ethusd feed assets feeds denominated eth
359047,chainlink oracles also look 1 exchange multitudes avoid cases 1 data point fails
359048,u could pull data contract every instance
359049,nothing aave eth insolvency defi idk people dig
359050,mean get seems like data points bueno
359051,seems weird market price 880 would similar elsewhere we're talking 895 oracle
359052,anyways want clog chat take attack lol
359053,im also curious
359054,denominate eth position
359055, think talks dont work aave ihave idea
359056,thanks mate
359057,usdd work exactly ust minting burning trx usdd
359058,differnt
359059,yes
359060,
359061,f
359062,ehh sort minting burning controlled multisig certain authorized parties allowed mint withburn trxusdd
359063,thx
359064,didnt know
359065,centralized means death spiral much difficult
359066,
359067,everyone redeem iirc thats big difference
359068,agree big difference
359069,thanks
359070,
359071,
359073,where's demand coming still synth markets lyra smth else
359074,milli3e feel free shill
359075,demand comes people panicking synth positions
359077,protocol verge maybe collapsing actually generates fees building buy narrative kinda amazing witness
359081,correct ethereum interest holders burnt eth aave takes percentage interest payments also funny stopped reached curve ens
359083,like geth rpc api call get request let's argue post get would prefer 1 2 
359084,1 really make much sense path semantics least params part
359085,come
359086,2 conforms get requests
359087,param1valueparam2value2 look like nested structure path supposed represent different mental modal actually mean
359088,hmmm ok 2 uglier tho
359089,takes space
359090,api cares takes space uglier
359091,cuz u want human readable
359092,yep agree uglier first look using intended representation presentation issue always abstract nicer script encoding objects url params pretty standard
359093,1 also play well lot http tooling btw
359094,dev tooling mean
359095,would make look nicer kinda tooling
359096,forget thus far one authorized parties burned usdd
359097,low level example languages sort uri encodedecode functionality allows take url change value param1 get new url pretty approach lose semantics argument called cant operations
359098,speaking usdd headsup shorting justlend 
359099,would use post json payload said discuss part 
359100,use get want nft tokenuri point eth function call
359101,get also fine btw guess question concern making look nicer
359103,yep done external tooling
359105,extreme could even use raw hex calldata param decode outside
359106,wallets already regular transactions
359107,want seems show user call contractfunca1a2
359112,deviation trigger heartbeat nothing time ethusd updates every 05% every hour 05% move hour
359113,there's good there's good good assets probably dropped least 40% since dec 21 yields dropped least 50% they'll need raise lot downscale lot
359114,basically ever pools univ3 dexes liquidity imbalances volatility spot markets cexs lot swap volume 1inch curve run synthetix atomic swaps futures optimism picking volume recently
359115,
359116,cool thread
359117,absolutely wrong
359118,
359119,bro people even google
359120,also hilarious bis pride flag logo
359121,literally helped facilitate nazi war crimes still institution reputation speaks volumes society
359122,maybe hilarious best phrase
359123,guy good man remember gifting 2btc researcher randomly lol
359124,andrewsmartcontract isnt poor
359125,oh btc guy
359126,wang chun
359128,right
359130,ok share project im working moment
359132,make bip take satoshi moved btc 10 years airdrop proportionally btc hodlers imho thats fair lost coins shouldnt lost forever 21m 21m proposer get 1% saved btc thats imho fair glad code free give 50% earnings people approve pr 
359137,next implement negative interest rate unmoved coins people using bitcoins contributing adoption bitcoin course need maintain 21m 21m airdrop bitcoins negative interest people actually using bitcoin
359138,bitcoin robinhood's vision
359139,great idea nakamote proud us csv even real 
359140,small message showcase maybe small link 1 sentence unique oke ser
359141,need daos anymore
359142,hello contracts dont work someone terminated one
359143,blz either decent takes nothing
359144,
359145,
359146,random larp marketing move dontravlos
359147,doesnt seem relevance
359148,simon involved bitfinex hack restructuring
359149,funny bailouts happening crypto nowadays
359150,dunno take yeah maybe marketing
359151,
359152,big difference publicly financed bailouts private investors looking lose principle restructuring obligations
359153,crypto printer go brrr reinventing wheel 
359156,due hostile market conditions bancors impermanent loss protection temporarily paused il protection reactivated protocol market stabilizes info we're hosting community ama 15 minutes 
359157,clear means would normally get say 50% tkn 50% bnt get 50% tkn bnt decide withdraw il compensation disabled that's correct lol basically bancor rugged protocol insolvent
359158,thursday confident protocol healthy
359159,found recently celsius wallet withdrawing large amounts liquidity protocol
359160,exacerbated coordinated flight liquidity coming right
359161,withdrawals processed organic way protocol would able handle
359162,appears hostile antagonist creating short positons manipualting bnt price combine large amounts withdraws happening simultaneously
359163,left uncomfortable decision letting play something
359164,damn everyone blames mercenary liquidity hostile antagonist coordinated whale attack
359165,wait markets stabilize investigating best methods restore il protection elaborate attempt i've seen trying solve impermanent loss flaw thinking something solvable
359166,thought bancor new verison amm paid sit pool
359167,historically yes v3
359168,oh
359169,well migrate everyone v3 remember bunch hype around
359170,best risk transferred another user premium innovative ways solve something plan writing implementing soon
359171,yup risk cannot destroyed transformed
359172,bancor death spiral came sooner expected
359173,want solve impermanent loss get rid liquidity provision puts lps business 
359175,solve wrong word like saying solving smart contract exploit risk depeg risk etc insurance possible solution option somewhat mitigate risk side possibly gain offering cover
359176,really risk problem even problem people trying eat cake want able profit providing liquidity lose nothing liquidity used liquidity
359177,believe equilibrium point lp would accept risk il behalf lps wish exposure il terms agreement underlying yield enough cases compensate potential losses considering swap yields right result competitive rates sides
359179,problem risk people managing risk effectively enough
359181,reeeeee mods
359182,course there's lot finagling market good sorta works andre tried i'd say bancor especially paired dex thorough attempt sure certain people kept claiming never mentioned certain things andor tried redefine funny terms everything pretty laid work trying solve leg broken car problem cars break legs legs let car leg
359183,lol bancor tg people accusing team leveraged trading liquidity understand risk even managing
359184,nobody complains impermanent loss making limit order insert cex
359185,we've working experimental pool types hope simulationsactual data show soon nice see market pushing innovative products extreme
359186,another problem kinda reveals crypto there's lot winknod dyor clearly messaging lost also there's lot honour system play give ppl ability shit want someone gonna
359187,well part problem marketing sole focus growth costs means turn blind eye users comes system without ever fully understanding participating
359188,declare protocol obsolete im deeply triggered il pause
359189,devs stop something
359190,think partially marketing partially devs expecting everyone people know things guess exclusive either see sentiment though getting rekt kind rite passage times marketing types i've encountered barely able explain understand risks entirely founders recognize push users better educated
359191,eh completeness see liquity
359192,imo competitor protocol vertical emerged clear winner
359193,we're much yet
359194,yeap seems completely fair
359195,depends vertical well see reason can't 1294837 mildly successful lending protocols survive years winner takes view dexes
359196,even really experienced crypto gone complete 0 atleast tbh agree mismatch dev expects users aware actually aware help loudest influencers idea beyond superficial stuff want discuss stuff pump bags
359197,least say even pmf multisig keys controlling everything place forever
359198,bancor always risky
359199, always felt good true almost obviously
359200,yeah tried solve circular rectangle crypto indeed try make things
359201,walked could run yeah that's also true something needs change think something pressure community can't future finance shit hits fan everyone goes lol tough shit
359202,yeah never used v2 v3 looked bit better never expected 115 weeks opening gates pull rug 
359203,feel like year bancor comes feature claiming done impossible weeks later announces feature shut turned impossible
359204,bancor v2 turned massively gameable launched bancor v21 turned massively dilutive launched bancor v3 turned
359205,loose sketch apologies im misremembering sequence
359206,keep trying
359207,lping everywhere leads il kek
359208,tldr v2 gameable
359209,oracle updates got fruntrun fun profit
359210,lping without il risk isnt lping lending
359211,v21 sought socialize il risk across pairs actually could worked fees uni unfortunately entire country went bankrupt
359212,would socializing risk good idea
359213,sadly french never win
359214,could always lp across group pools wanted diversify
359215,maybe hold one shitcoin
359216,looked swaap finance polygon claim help heavily reduce il matrix market maker approach
359217,end day someone lose matter much math word play use
359218,solution il guaranteed profitable trading strategy doesnt exist longterm
359219,arent saying solution protocol wont allow trading pools become unbalanced 2%
359220,wrong
359221,mint tokens sir
359222,touch
359223,math enthusiasts euphoric
359224,interested know working interest rate futures system sounds like could overlap
359227,solend redoing vote

359269,hello guys im looking something someone adviced ask would like know guys know tool calculate price impact tx hash thank advance mates 
359270,unless contract's abi
359271,protocol txhash could number different onchain dex's tools
359272,im currently looking pancake swap transaction made think could useful blockchain
359273,work
359274,every protocol different set events andor onchain outputs
359275,uniswapv2 descendants outputs reasonable amount legwork make sure case
359276,given trade see least two events sync event liquidity pool end trade swap event actual inputs outputs
359277,calculate looking liquidity pool looked like trade there's enough info events construct
359278,yep miss liquidity pool amount trade right sure say
359279,true
359280,thank mate
359281,hey guys would easiest way obtain univ3 historical pool states large scale hundreds pools since inception know tool official graph seem work poorly ticks thanks advance
359282,unless someone paying cardinality would use paid analytics service
359283,know data provider
359284,checked try flipside crypto
359285,vpepo might also able help
359286,thank sir check guys know liquidity manager claims fair sustainable alpha dexes providing liquidity mid freq trading considering flasharbitrage liquidation hunters mempool scrappers
359287,dont know easiest extracting data archive node fairly straight forward
359288,dune analytics check mint burn swap events
359289,wont able download data
359290,bitstamp charges inactivity fee 10 eurmonth users less 200 eur assets balance 
359291,lol
359292,robbery
359293,ridiculous
359294,moving kraken
359295,oh flipside crypto way querying via api select flipsideproddbuniswapv3poolstats limit 100 
359296,trying enforce 8020 rule start ups popular brex stopped serving small businesses
359298,what's 8020 rule 80% income coming 20% users something like biggest income coming small amount dedicatedrichheavy users
359299,like outright theft
359300,nothing 8020
359301,solend team says consulted vcsinvestors stani one
359302,mean
359303,yeh pareto efficiency
359304,stanikulechov said terrible idea seems fake
359305,
359306,following logic charging larger customers reckon trying force platform without outright
359307,taking one accounts sounds sorta outright
359308,yeah really sounds like forcing platform like either deposit leave since take funds via fees 20 months best case
359309,way solend handling pretty rubbish proposal 2 doesnt 100% guarantee proposal 1 could come effect know proposal 3 might cancel proposal 2 see btc sub20k lol
359310,well technically could consult listen vcs investors lol
359311,exterra employees banned leaving south korea 
359312,wow bad getting like p2p company employee treatment china
359317,pretty much every country bans people leaving investigation seems normal much indicative though sk thinks shady stuff
359318,never transparency counter party btc dump luna purchase trades lfg right
359319,also one interesting thing guy marks profile he's bitcoiner since 2008and he's working luna lol
359320,hey everyone made dashboard nounsnounsdao thought may interested 
359321,made something work thought worth sharing founders dai able market something ponder much selling point strong track record mim frenzy late 2021 still kept good engagement rates usdn algorithmic stablecoin high engagement rates 2021 algorithmic stablecoins usdd uxd picked past q2 2022 overcollateralized stablecoins fei dai work based algorithmic stablecoins comes marketing able sell idea undercollateralized stablecoin need top tier marketing engagement rates proves mim probably review content strategy focus strenghts
359322,zooming zooming c ladies gentlemen q2 2022
359323,rt posts excluded engagement rate flawed since engagement comes stablecoin account person retweeted
359324,wow thats nice agree mim kept quite 2022 lot news 2021
359325,mim quite funny case feels like guerilla marketing done web similarly frog nation
359326,mim frog nation tho
359327,curious
359328,yeah project spectacularly implodes theres whole bunch intransparent stuff going founder id utmost clear protect reputation wasnt anything shady going
359329,thought wonderland partnered always thought two separate entities x thank correcting 
359330,wonderland also frog nation
359331,dani rugging stuff
359332,maybe devs r genuine aint
359333,sesta great marketing sure he's great building sustainable products
359334,kinda sad stablecoin marketing see predatory
359335,su zhu kwon share psycho personality tbh
359336,reference would interesting see ust well widely labelled stablecoin time interval
359337,great talking bullshit public absorb
359338,think adoption come marketing still used predatory way we're literally using similar branding casinos usdd usdn cults ust mim focusing profitsyield instead safetyfunctionality
359339,i'll add probably curiosity making dashboard know stablecoin monitor benchmarking purposes working stablecoin x
359340,ust probably excellent benchmark lasted
359341,crypto giant casino point time world driven marketing every field noticed massive quality reduction even quality brands switch minimalistic design fits everyone special characters valued marketing drives sales
359342,can't see working ust terra comes marketing tldr want learn evil way marketing stables lol
359343,true still remember flat design became thing x logos 3d hard use multiple supports x
359344,everything failure dedicated cycle pump dumping algorithmic stable coins died like basis cash forks
359345,entire cycle crap put death spiral even people believed ust luna blows mind stupid herd
359346,surprised deceitful talking collateralizing stablecoin displaying ust usd terra protocols see alice even fully presenting risks uxd algorithmic well yet clearly state insurance fund goes 0 funding rates negative they're rekt kind transparency important ust clearly explained risk try sell idea fact usd yield much retail rekt death spirale
359347,people bought luna supply going trillions
359348,think reason retail got rekt
359349,retail would get rekt anyway luna without imo
359350,retail degen knows nothing want ape become billionaire overnight retail important consider ethically speaking average joe wants face inflation invested ust stablecoin label
359351,think make distinction considered retail size
359352,willful ignorance however genuine ignorance supposedly excuse putting money random stuff
359353,kinda funny apparently ever innocent retail somehow always able research rekt somehow never put money contract people unironically think they're entitled riskfree profitmaking endeavors refuse can't bothered read
359354,think one fault mean innocent otherwise let's make biggest scams market retail safest investment blame retail aping
359355,scams get anywhere one puts money
359356,want concrete example here's usdd's tweet engagement
359357,overcollateralized they're selling stablecoin overcollateralized using dual token model god want slap hard reading
359358,marketing kicks brandolini law action
359359,retail luna going stay poor criticize luna retail bottom fell help i'm innocent
359360,nothing gets coiner going quite like retail
359361,yessir
359362,stupid argument lunaust marketed reasonably safe investments saying retail done dd makes sense biggest firms got caught pants shit show
359364,yes shilled low risk yield
359365,dumb claiming theranos legit got vc money
359366,exactly large caps shilled biggest names industry trying blame retail getting caught misleading marketing institutionalized shilling stable coin dangerous mechanism completely missing point
359367,dumb new fresh money entered cycle low understanding fundamentals usually comes literally people earth looks someone better field review
359368,theranos fooled everyone supposedly smart institutions longest time point we're making
359369,loading jordan peterson personal responsibility 50% conplete
359370,that's argument argument big reputable retail figures space shilled intensively influencer quarter million people following said riskfree one case among others llama said can't expect retail dd want adoption
359371,presented low risk yield people others considered professionals etc saying right that's things works
359372,imagine go bank ask income statement balance sheet opening account
359373,check messages never talked luna buyers ust buyers hence bank comparison
359374,unbank banked ust afterlife motto 
359375,literally marketed better savings ffs
359376,whos arguing im confused everyone guilty
359377,see point wanting adoption people clearly use crypto aside using fodder pump people's bags suppose say quiet part loud
359378,shit cashio tryna beat inflation
359379,fun staying poor type ppl
359380,adoption happens new people joining ones wants stay learn hard way
359382,people research presented 20% apr sold low risk sure expect industry leaders builders create sound protocols thot leaders shill dangerous investments clueless masses also yes
359383,expect projects appeal snake oil salesman tactics drive adoption risky financial products uneducated target audience also yes
359384,yet people criticizing theranos start like luna people sell crypto bank control money storytelling yet start crying faced reality actually people stop pretending retail innocent toddlers simultaneously old enough buy things also young make decisions bear consequences maybe place get somewhere
359385,want see enough legit defi projects risk low enough onboard mother whos financially illiterate
359386,mom still doesnt wallet yet hope able proudly onboard future
359387,thats defi future want
359388,can't onboard mom computer let alone crypto 
359389,lol
359390,haha mine curious enough shes wondering day staying home lol
359391,feels like trying onboard someone torrenting can't figure web browser
359392,bet get mom download torrents safely 1 day lets admit crypto ux worst
359393,ui better tbh combo makes painful
359394,mean im still slinging shitcoins using metamask 
359395,downloads malware gets rekt would propose torrenting space change suit
359396,tell want crypto piracylike space without telling want
359397,sure think i'm subtle
359398,lets agree disagree coming third world country dont see mean make money save money efficient manner
359399,would expect people introduces torrenting educate possibility protect
359400,think people business crypto vast majority people completely uninterested unprepared unwilling bearing consequences using terms
359401,served sufficiently use already make crypto useless anymore success streaming services makes torrenting failure
359402,crypto regulated whether want would better selfregulate focusing ethical aspects calling scams
359403,im hearing since joined 2017
359404,can't expect people lacks basic financial literacy suddenly come learn everything lot knowledge accessible case collective understands risk take steps make sure actually learn need
359405,yellen talked ust collapse need regulate stablecoins
359406,also paying price silence
359407,oh it'll regulated alright much clear already fantastic example sort regulation needed cater retail keep retail fun times ahead 
359409,self regulation anything ever worked
359410,like ouroboros need kind discipline dont think self regulation works scales regulation converge problems regulatory caputre abuse power etc
359411,well canonical example hollywood
359412,age well
359413,
359414,interesting want break can't enforce anything remit code conduct ie harvery weistein bill cosby still went jail also crypto also money would expect bar higher
359415,seems like people kind misunderstand average retail user well hopping telegramdiscord yelling people stay poor tbh that's exactly consider retail retail users ones likely look website reviews different news outlets etc rather venture telegram etc case information largely available much romantic positives
359416,people know figureheads stan follow twitter owner bank
359417,
359418,reading hard
359419,thats said bit higher weve talking using definition
359420,embittered lets keep discussion cordial 
359421,think big difference someone financial services bank forms contracts explanations average retail user cant find documents page similar research investments mean
359422,banks obligated regulation present things specific way clearly can't tell explanations information made available crypto projects
359423,mean il protection mechanism turn bear turn back bull lowers efficacy message protocol think there's way il lping somebody eat costs can't mint way
359424,havent found documentation errors cornerstone defi projects retail cant find fishsandwichswap docs idk
359425,can't find information simply put money
359426,yes agree retail 
359427,really trying say project done utmost clearly communicate risks many people getting rekt problem messaging getting across
359428,reference ape ask questions later documents page thank
359429,likewise rather going hurr durr u got rekt make effort recognize actual issue regards communicated begin lol
359430,think we're talking two entirely different things even documentation still people present potential risks gloss like haha problems future finance etc
359431,speaking communication could argue way kwon publicly guaranteed peg falls foul finance law arent allowed guarantee returns
359432,totally side maybe certification dao set norm similarly iso clear framework
359433,really talking communication issues riskiest speculative assets planet people well aware play roulette money willingly
359434,sure like told start care one way bancor point replying point fact talk economics works ways criticized saying implying right spec strange

359790,prob easier write jsts script attempt modify forge work 1 pk
359791,oh interesting os took gem uniswap takes genie
359792,let vc bags fight uni cuter tho
359793,yep yep
359794,uni gonna become looks genie
359795,
359796,wait sure understood uni acquired genie like opensea acquired gem looksrare like opensea comparison
359797,think referring becoming incentive token nft exchange
359798,yeah
359799,genie take cut trading fees
359800,well uni levels bigger genie semi fork gem cares point guess
359801,
359803,feeling change
359804,announcement kilnropstenrinkeby deprecation time move goerli sepolia 
359805,thought genie came first compared gem
359806,dev team creators left unknown reasons idk faith side subjectively aware one side kinda arrogant one humble u u
359807,vasa
359808,that's matters
359809,better question nft avenue short answer dates attached roadmap promising hit targets particular order
359810,hmm interesting uni swap acquired aggregator instead building market
359811,sorry asked wrong group 
359812,yeah genie feels like public good
359813,since
359814,uniswap labs btw protocol
359815,put like genie charge fee basically free use maybe like charity instead since aggregator can't really direct fees uniswap labs either unless uniswap labs built market
359816,stick fee top metamask
359817,wait fee easily switched probably forget gem
359818,old pic still relevant
359820,maybe relevant new opensea
359821,surprised usdd's marketing capabilities
359822,guys monsters
359823, genie mostly lost gem opensea optimized smart contracts making genie less valuable nft market badly visible uptrend genie wasnt taking fees genie fired several people team week ago must really good deal uniswap buy great product core team probably 150m
359824,couldnt find genie raised bootstrapped taking fees maybe actually ran cash
359825,val would good deal side tbh half gem remember correctly case ggwp scott negotiating
359826,agree must good deal sides
359827,funfact genie gem team
359828,cto others decided leave due unknown reason start gem
359829,
359830,genie wild success closed beta exploded quickly many funds including team frothing invest
359831,knowledge close round fundraising round put together last fall never closed genie take fees would quite difficult imo overwhelming majority volume routed opensea easy users bypass fee wish use genie identify best price execute marketplace public good sure becomes open credibly neutral tool keen see plays
359832,finally nftx uniswap
359833,gonna tho
359834,pretty sure genie already supports nftx
359835,assuming lift
359837,
359838,ye nftx team saying genie already support
359840,dune currently doesnt count seaport volume keep mind outdated 15 june
359841,ge sers decent nft aggregators except genie gems
359842,well airdropping usdc usdc work
359843,lans use cash dao
359844,
359845,gib uniswap treasury genie users 
359846,imo reservoir best positioned aggregator compete w marketplace since native liquidity
359847,looking ones specifically end users
359848, credibly neutral operators
359849,
359850,levee built reservoir's orderbook team building full fledge consumer app akin gemgenie
359851,closed round public info whatsoever
359852,see possible reply right
359853,mean
359854,may 1st close round
359855,hood protocol run decentralized network opensource indexer nodes aggregate offchain onchain liquidity easy use readily available trustminimized reservoir's aggregated orderbook enables innovation across nft stack novel sources liquidity next generation consumerfacing nft products
359856,
359857,want give disclaimer shill portfolio companies
359858,guessing uniswap bought think next big onramp nftsgamefi
359859,reservoir portfolio company delphi digital
359860,always give disclaimers
359861,hmm there's lot buzzwords lot heavy lifting
359862,however hope one day 
359863,whoop bad
359864,regards nft aggregators suppose neutrality would also operate marketplace
359865,really weak position negotiate maybe uniswap even saved death considering market conditions deal size easily 5075m 
359866,anyone could operate said marketplace orderbook persisted arweave indexer node open source effect get permissionless operation aggregator
359867,0x nft feature full swap right aggregator
359868,understand aggregator valued much dealroom valued around 40m they've developing aggregator since 2012
359869,unless way monetize better web2 aggregators ecommerce
359870,gotta user stickyness team imagine uniswap could copied much less
359871,users they're airdropping usdc retain
359872,ye makes sense nft defi audience surprisingly seperated lot nft whales see defi ponzi lot untapped value users convert like pokerstars launching casino 
359873,bold statement people whose arch nemesis screenshot tool
359875,i'm speculating must reasons smarter lol
359876,ye works way well limited sample size defi users
359877,nft whales nonexisting concept whale cant 5m lets say net even liquid worth since like 10 collections items worth enough something point lets say 3 top collections got lucky choosing avg one item 40 eth like 50 120 total pieces 50 eth tag literally 6m like 50 punks 50 apes 50 doodles still barely whale fuck nft whale like 10 apes people 5 doodles people dozen punk sers early flipperscollectors like singaling literally fixed math sorry
359878,guess move existing audience new product category fees move new audience existing products see value ways plus nfts nice ramp retail tbh
359880,thats like saying scratch offs good entry casino
359881,casino side get em sports betting convert slots
359882,
359883,fixed math sorry
359885,dunno done maths nft whales hear phrase thrown around lol
359886,lot nft whales see defi ponzi irony 
359887,maybe build speculative value opensea worth 
359888,tbh need liquidity whale nft whales need attract defi actual liquidity
359889,lol common
359890,uni bought genie means mainchat gonna ducked definft would new term cant image someone bought ape leverage long uni lendingetc
359892,ye got done ust 
359894,nft whales ones sold flipped frowned upon nft collectors ironic nft investors dislike defi cuz missed salty also ironic
359895,ye fact talk nft guys like get scammed dms talk us like ponzi scams shows divide two user groups
359897,still can't wrap head around integrating aggregator makes sense uni labs maybe wanted team develop inhouse nft liquidity protocol something
359898,someone smarter work right assumption maths saw user bases overlap deterimined users high enough value acquire maybe team acquired really valuable
359899,well nfts mainstream defi better worse
359900,that's good point actually though always assumed gem one user share
359901,talk cheap need waffling objectively identify one likely ponzi
359902,neither ponzi like either nfts ponzis defi ponzis value
359903,easy way grow user base without wait new people enter space
359904,price announced
359907,eh think attracts similar amount grifters grifting skillset required different nfts suited low tech high social engagement grifters
359912,way see jpeg important part nfts community created around
359914,guess pure black white rather spectrum community important defi
359916,scam mints seen works creating community maximum hype
359918,quality
359920,tbh right probably means nft users greennew space good ramp uni
359921,quality mean
359922,wtf question
359923,pretty simple question
359925,
359926,nft rug projects learning experiences
359930,heard uniswap v3 issues nft liquidity providers count nft whales 
359931,nft whale count 
359934,probably disagree mmorpg past truly believe digital ownership bad didnt go past 10k pfp
359936,sers kinda blabla harmless fin
359937,what's
359940,something nonfactual random convo tried intervene convo got smileys nfts pixels quality
359941,i'm okay ending conversation think discussion quality actually means nft seems like legitimate topic conversation
359942,
359943,ser super subjective different everybody convos nftavenue literally dozen times fork okay devs need vested 3 yrs launch fair etc really
359944,fair enough
359945,
359946,ve33 20 wars
359947,tvl wars
359948,actually wrong huge brr huge tvl huge wars
359949,huge brr free brr projects recieved venfts need dilute native governance token use ve33 liquidity incentive
359950,ye like giving tool ecosystem public good really pumo us done guess
359951,ye issa community based dex
359952,dictators socialism 
359953,irl tho
359954,hey gang trying explore onchain history cryptopunks sales seeing conflicting data opensea cryptopunksapp site anybody able shed light 
359955,punks created erc721 standards opensea show transactions wrapped versions
359956,believe vice versa 100% sure
359957,thanks chiming think os tracks standard punks sales even combining lifetime vol erc721 wrapped punks thats 10k eth wonder theyre also somehow tracking secondary market sales fractionalized punks via stuff like nftx
359958,standard abbreviation lending protocols like compound aave etc feels like roughly many different ones dexes good short name 
359959,lex
359968,coinbase poorly ipod peak raking didnt offer high yields since fall lots venture capital different projects ftx firing people american way downturn arent japanese im saying buy waiting 2q report say many exchanges without sec reporting
359969,money market
359970,see burned unaudited 71 b 61 b 123121 33122
359971,naive question people think covid kills crypto back
359973,liquidity crisis crypto needs zirp economic stimulus
359974,without excessive risk profiles venture capital retail flush cash crypto markets break solely way absorb appetite risk high demand tech speculation would disappeared without qe zirp usa
359975,people afraid qe zirp stop due pandemic think
359976,ffr near 0 liquidity crisis happened march 2020 qe nowhere near crazy treasury markets deepest markets world usually unload hundreds billions bills without moving price20 bps max march 2020 could offload 20 million 10 year treasury bills move price 100 bps depth gone liquidity disappeared happens crypto time like well makerdao entered shortfall ethereum grinded near halt surprise people thought saved last 2 years qe zirp going away
359977,uhh missing something makerdao entered shortfall ethereum grinded near halt
359978,yes that's correct need timely liquidations avoid shortfall never said entered shortfall reason
359979,
359980,grinded near halt means gas fees went dramatically mean
359981,laid 20% staff one closest peers bailing entire space
359983,random sizechad whale
359984,
359985,seems better version web3 shill ceo a16z 
359986,economist would say qe zirp would bring non existent demand future economies would raise trade barriers without ability export like 2008 economist would say lockdowns would automatically destroy economy massive creation money supply would enable politicians accelerate timeline greatest depression demand environment cant increase productivity furthers moral hazard pandemic created moment fud ended two weeks lockdowns started knew banks federal government one choice since couldnt admit theyre leveraged crypto didnt know fed govt would increase money supply 30% weeks eth btc recovered
359987,general thoughts gavin always seemed like one space still reputation intact
359988,either ftx already capital coinbase ipo point coinbase captured market share since perception coinbase better coinbase actually last year coinbase us uk eu
359989,ftx made huge jump foray going global 3 years coinbase working making us politicians happy lobbying efforts help sustained long term effort regulation
359990,mean describes eli5 way even normans understand like
359991,coinbase futures derivatives trading desk etc
359992,ftx biggest profits extracting value solana shitcoins rotating liquidating derrivs apes otc seems like slowdowned lot recent years
359993,meant terms vision reputation alot original ethereum founders reputations exactly fared well whereas noone seems speak ill gavin also still seems aspire original ethos
359994,sure trolling serious 
359995,polkadot performed quite shitty cycle sure reputation many crypto natives still think scam lol
359996,chain governance nice tho
359997,troll swear i'm interested general perception mind polkadot performed poorly i'd rather get tech correct
359998,i'm big fan dotsama btw like xcmp think spree really unique general i'm fan whole architecture
359999,reputation jumped cliff polkadot centralization aside frozen eth tried forcefully release
360000,onchain gov quite easy force users lock tokens duration vote
360001,mind expanding centralization issue right forum
360002,chain governance like voting short term gains eg trying push op native gas token thank goodness there'll citizen house keep check voting noncryptoethical things eg solend trying take someone's funds many negative examples past month
360003,get rid storytelling cut right chase polkadot yet another dpos chain dpos 1 token 1 vote get cartel might nice friendly cartel cartel nonetheless
360004,mean say pos chains there's obviously spectrum i've seen prevalent accusation unique dpos
360005,dpos much unique selling point entire design there's difference cartel design maybesomething far spectrums go dpos end whatever assume spectrum pos
360006,read yet seems relevant 
360008,figures sometimes misleading
360010,hey guys remember websites could breakdown ethereum transactions cant find atm
360011,damn dystopia even work metamask installed
360012,get tech correct imo cosmos hub superior implementation differences course end result cosmos also first vision afaik way ahead polkadot implementation adoption
360013,site helped add multiple network config metamask
360014,
360015,mmmm i'd tend disagree message passing chains cosmos superior polkadot imo lack shared security model considered superior cosmos ahead adoption sure say something binary cosmos superior polkadot nuanced also polkadot data availability built whereas cosmos independent chain could argued that's pro con depending side fence sitting
360016,mean guess forget pedo fud thing
360017,haha actually forget take back
360018,well really fud uncertain terms accepted actually wrote blog post
360019,mean people obviously love weird erotica here's trader joe frankly bizarre erotica 
360020,can't nice things
360021,yeah think level nerd's weird kink lot different someone fantasising kids spark intellectual debate
360022,that's fair defending gavin
360023,broke eth lost stupid tokens parity fuckup still love gav good buidlr good leader beachsunglassesjpg
360024,pedo btw
360026,
360027,forkless upgrades message passing shared security real killers 
360028,yeah super impressed past upgrades i'm constantly getting messari updates cosmos chains that's meant disrespectful dive substrate built upgradeability elegant
360030,nakamoto coefficient pos chains per latest tob audit done darpa
360031,nakamoto coefficient represents number validators nodes would collude together successfully slow block respective blockchain functioning properly
360032,analysis bad
360033,conflate validators validator operator conflate direct vs indirect control constituent operators case pools
360034,yeah best approach sure example would argue right metrics eth2 would far decentralized solana avalanche
360035,reads like report narrative first set find reasons justify narrative
360036,pow analysis bad regard really superficial analysis hashrate stakeflow dynamics
360037,comissioned us governmanet could little
360038,hey guys here's list go guys vc funds investing indian web3 
360039,interesting timing bis report saying cbdcs future crypto
360040,fight man he's
360041,hi guys anyone consolidated launchpad report 2021 2022
360042,launchpad
360043,binance launchpad polkastarter platform
360044,many many
360045,
360046,cryptorank probably data ieo ido platform performances
360047,since launch 3 decentralized ido platforms least 10 sales averaged profit users
360048,yes would like take look deeper analysis median % tokens given platforms projects trading volumes potential commission received exchange etc
360049,dont think many places gatehred data unfortunately especially centralized platforms profits probably shared
360050,doubt info even publicly available
360051,think centralized exchanges main income cases trading commissions including trading token
360052,would usually even know real % given private deals price performance also doesnt say much given assets went
360053,think exchanges dont care price asset except commissions trading launchpad token theres nothing earn subjective opinion
360054,remember drawn prices btt ignited fomo among many thereby pushing demand bnb trading volume increased significantly
360055,meaningless distinctions within context analysis whether control indirect change reality number entities need coerce undertake attack mention next page goes specifics mining pools actually function
360056,course changes reality coercing mining pool coercing single legal entity therefore treating equivalent incorrect
360057,mining pool run single legal entity
360058,mining pools need legal entities one
360059,gavin poster boy wanxiang fenbushi asian powers assigned dotsama second choice know people west love
360060,two mining pool getting captured closed government thing giant miner getting closed captured
360061,that's nice matter people talked neutered entities stronger claim nondescript may may 500 lemmings comprise pool may run realize pool attack noise
360062,noise actually run cannot coerced pool whomever captured pool wants absolutely dilutes effectiveness purported attack
360063,botnets stop botnets functional remove device attack realize what's happening
360064,
360065,
360066,fast constituent miners involved react percentage actually react actually realize what's going claiming glossed mining pools discovered today mining pools tested either assign hardcoded password accounts simply validate password provided authentication example viabtc accounts appear assigned password 123 poolin seems validate authentication credentials slushpool explicitly instructs users ignore password field legacy stratum protocol parameter use nowadays20 discovered registering multiple accounts mining pools examining server code available three mining pools alone account roughly 25% bitcoin hashrate next page dubious
360067,actually taking stratum
360068,maybe ddos pool ok
360069,read report job find things
360070,i've read report
360071,superficial makes mountains molehills
360072,think mining pool legal entity remotely relevant certainly adds color conclusion means
360073,thanks sharing dont mind centralized servers used asset hosting experience example better 1000 words used play dofus french mmorpg day still rare cosmetic item got 10 years ago would love seeing nfts facilitate trade back wanted sell item fiat sell kamas game currency find virtual currency broker okgoods good back lol sell kamas receive money paypal
360074,far done move goal posts understand actual implications socalled grave passage called
360075,since also third world country needed transfer funds paypal family member finally cash
360076,huh claim simply glossed mining pools that's demonstrably untrue
360077,actually literlaly mention mining pools
360078,referred validators
360079,took mean mining pools responded specifically regards
360080,conflate validators validator operator conflate direct vs indirect control constituent operators case pools
360081,pow analysis bad regard really superficial analysis hashrate stakeflow dynamics
360082,sure
360083,analysis hashratestakeflow superficial basically analyzed edit ok incorrect analyzed context 51% attacks makes sense since that's would mostly apply takes granted analysis locus power 3 mining pools extrapolates without accounting easily hashrate flow
360084,say look mining pools use really bad p2p software coordinate mayb eit could usedc ddos
360085,ok
360086,um get story straight talk mining pools
360087,accusing moving goalposts surely
360088,fun edit lol carry
360089,said pow analysis superficial mentioned mining pools specifically replied think that's pretty clear point we're going circles want add explanation stratum somehow giant security hole would allow someone take 3 hashpools lead 51% attack please
360090,quote make point 51% attack report multipage reason quoted claims simply glossed mining pools going circles yeah ninja edit fact case point reading report guilty superficial
360094,1 teasers uniswap haydeneth link link discussion link discussion 2 thread defi option vaults dovs link link discussion 3defi teller defitellerguru calls experts comments 3ac link discussion 4 ftx provide 250m credit line blockfi link link discussion 5 decent nft aggregators except genie gems link discussion link discussion

360110,he's playing brilliantly use alameda background liquidate everyone's postions make go bankrupt ftx good guy bail everyone eventually he'll control entire space
360111,alameda bailing voyage ftx
360112,know recycling ct joke
360113,

360115,guys find yfi fees generated per month maybe 3 month

360122,hahaha crypto joke
360123,believe collateralized
360125,mean make exchange point
360126,guys find much fees crypto projects earn per month time
360127,could rollup connect ibc 
360128,
360129,sites coins one
360130,try token terminal may dashboards dune
360131,ok thanks
360132,wanna ask planning treat information
360133,hope taking face value
360134,dont get cosmos sett layer still using starknet wtf going
360135,
360136,metrics correspond reality
360137,thats issue analysis without broader picture metrics relevant almost every protocol inflation model see high earnings might coming huge issuance even bots saying drastically influences questions
360138,logic even apply speak defi projects
360139, still considering happen existing v3 system built starkware spokesperson said
360140,absolutely applies even
360141,thanks bro think
360142,
360143,ahh ethereum based l2s currently operate central sequencers
360144,makes sense tbh roadmap can't wait starknet decentralize
360145,thanks
360146,difference fully decentralized offchain orderbook matching engine one sought remove 
360147,fee decentralized sure
360148,hmm dyd doesnt want starkware
360149,would imagine cosmos much cheaper starkware need cut right
360150,would validium right rollup stores proof computation make data computation available blockchain essentially similar current starkex architecture replaced dac cosmos blockchain
360151,dydx frenship eth maxis dot maxis new best fren
360153,frontend blocking americans i'm assuming
360154,claim alternatives inadequate run clob dex want end state different cosmos ethereum l1 likely decentralized cosmos least time even close performant enough power dydx ethereum based l2s two issues close performant enough power dydx see offchain decentralized orderbook matching also currently operate central sequencers ability censor transactions solid plans many l2s decentralize sequencer network likely would decentralized point comparable could achieved dydx chain ethereum l1
360155,ohm make new token airdrop exit pump 
360156,well least muh innovation lets see ux
360157,decentralized sequencer implementation detail rather required feature zero rollup
360158,required feature rollup desirable one
360159,mainly scalability censorship resistance
360160,maybe something dont know eth network fees zkrollup big centralized sequencer reason
360161,plan starknet decentralize time sure timeline side though
360162,i'd say perfectly valid reason censorship resistance dex pretty real requirement
360163,reading correctly orderbook seems bit like mempool equivalent orders execution results stored chain state created orders inmemory validators
360164,compared current infrastructure orderbook matching engine run single entity generating proof executing trades
360165,distributed orderbook terrabutdifferent chain decentralized 
360166,well new l1 decentralised
360167,centralization get better time cosmos chain
360168,idea tendermint chains know pretty centralized one runs cz's backyard
360169,abt cronos
360170,pretty sure less validators bsc
360171,afaic remember cosmos well premier chain went doubledigit number validators needing collude single digit
360172,cosmos eco got rekt hard lunaust
360173,luna even ibc enabled
360174,think ibs
360175,what's ibs
360176,
360177,seems like luna ibc enabled since october turned death spiral
360178, u asked
360179,issue lot cosmos dexes lp pairs ustluna also 14 day unbonding period lpers got rekt hard reason shut ibc terra printed insane amounts luna created cascade affected dex liquidity lpers could inmediately unbond lp pair
360181,chain money lol
360182,hey coinbase actually decided list something good scbuergel hopr getting listed hour 
360183,
360184,shillingggg btw congratz gearbox
360185,cronos 27 last check bnb chain 21
360187,yeah cronos proof authority seems full permissioned bnb elected validator
360188,40 afaik 20 elected periodically actually propose blocks
360189,heh ask proof authority poa streamlined scalable consensus mechanism consensus protocol still maintaining security range validators many different parties run 
360190,good friends brockshane
360191,yesterday
360192,what's channel
360193, they're great work decentralising i'm moved tears
360195,dropsanalytics
360196,bnb smart chain longer 21 validators provide candidates choose new mechanism achievement unlocked decentralisation
360197,yup sent notice 3ac
360198,tbh always wondered chains use tendermint instead developing substrate substrate seems like better platform want build chain especially care part internet blockchains narrative

360304,hey protocolsprojects working crypto insurance specifically validators
360305,eliasimos would likely know best ye
360306,interesting dydx going cosmos 
360307,
360308,explainning better
360309,saving token price
360310,answer go
360311, seems validiums could create legal centralization problems projects
360312,one aspect never really wrap head around go experience becomes harder work rust certain size learning curve rust may steep certain size think projects actually benefit complexity rust simplicity go
360313,possibly thats viewing developer pov zoom think team company pov
360314,zoom even see always legal arbitrage 
360315,true anecdotally think blockchain industry concentrated pool rust devs industries using rust hypothetically blocker team get point maybe statistics completely proves hypothesis hiring rust dev blockchains wrong
360316,behind every protocol pivot lawyer disguise
360317,makes sense bearish people building mining pools generate zk proofs
360318,well dydx given deadline eoy 2022 think see major progress people mining pools zk proofs
360320,trying mean market value current step open question token value gain lose
360321,see tracking record appchain recently appchain disgusting thing especially like ronin dfk 
360322,well ibc id assume hope interoperate larger cosmos community
360323,paying validators proof stake transaction accrue value exchange token
360324,validators traders dydx 
360325,sentiments marketing matter actual utility
360326,yeah cares validators pay thats point
360327,circle mms got paid trading rewards staking rewards getting trading fees 
360328,nexus mutual launching one soon unslashed offering havent checked recently
360329,
360330,actually nexus already insures lido staking
360337, enjoy subnets good work avax people good luck 
360338,wait can't post 
360339,well message 50 links didnt seem particularly relevant 5 ecosystems post probably die
360340,throw link article list maybe thats totally okay
360341,unfortunally think nobody make article okay found article future post
360342,cool
360343,thank here's article wrote engagement rates across stablecoins continuation discussion engagement rates last time let know think 
360344,
360345,that's actually great centralized onchain forex tether expending rapidly since usdt's marketcap lost 20% understand c
360347,hopefully usdt needs get new fund system maintain solvency
360351,saw marusha pointing twitter tether backbone crypto
360352,position indeed scary
360353,cex use
360354,clear collateral disclosure
360355,freezable
360356,said stablecoin issuer fiat frozen design
360357,last point always undermined tho idk opensea banned iranian artists using platform block tether future 
360358,could expend point please
360359,usdc freeze options well example well
360360,option otherwise backing probably gets frozen end
360361,usdc aware point totally agree backing frozen option think separate bank money cash money fiat bank money freezable cash creating digital cash layer2 bank money c
360362,talismanxyz added evm support subwalletapp two good wallets polkadot eco also support evm need alternative want trim number extensions
360363,eh tether fud anything new one cares much
360364,yeah glad exited early free unlocks coinowl
360365,hey serge brotherhow
360366, finance bros research
360367,hey guys im sorry quite dumb question seem though cannot really find answer using ledger btc segwit account need somehow extract whole account history singe segwit recieving addresses always change sure use btc explorer segwit btc ledger account anyone help
360368,fudding actually saying important crypto fud
360369,lmao that's 3ac found clients kek
360370,point fudding point tether like willtheywontthey romantic pair long running sitcom exciting show started old people lost interest bad crypto tether falls yeah pretty bad nothing someone definitively proves tether enough assets back market cap even tether falls end lot competitors emerged possibly plug tether shaped whole
360372,lobsters api service layer return number users dapp
360375,trust purely personal preference give valid reasons usdt vs usdc things unfold expectation make sure trust dont regret
360378,hey what's reason users move dexes uni primarily aggregators discussion already
360379,would understandable aggregators efficient enough offer better rates
360381,1inch positive surplus sent treasury
360385,reason slippage starts mattering huge sizes size huge might even overpaying gas compared slippage save
360386,plus brand recognition stickiness
360388,yea remember year ago gas issue aggregators guess anymore unless users really trading small small size
360390,mean currently swap 100eth 1inch costs 12 vs 5 uni
360392,doubt retail trading 100 size onchain
360393,exactly
360394,dont need aggregation
360395,one pool would give u
360396,expeirence
360397,yea guess time check avg trade size

360421,u r random please yes
360422,thanks 
360423,they're usually subtle shilling various random projects likely scams
360424,best guess want seem real hope basement dwellers dm love get scamooord
360425,say good morning good night lot ive guessing love sharing sleeping schedules
360426,today i'm seeing lot spam time multiple channels

360431,
360433,
360434,
360435,
360437, people laughed jesus
360438,even though think sort dumb idea wonder inspired posting
360439,many times per day phone shut downs
360440,guy health secretary uk little bit surprised speech
360441,
360442,fuck repeat 2018
360443,fuckk remember htc phone samsung phone iota phone
360444,atleast time tell potential gf network avoid talking cell solanana
360445,jk jk never step away desk potential gf
360446,saga get
360447,imagine takes longer two weeks plan cell phone os launch maybe p
360449,build 2 weeks maybe thought say
360450,sirin labs henlo
360451,feels like huge news also validates traditionally organized nondao driven orgs advantage launching type products dont see chance eth could done doesnt matter succeeds thats pretty awesome moonshot
360452,wrong chat responding
360453,solana phone conversation responded sry
360454,ah sirin 30
360455,
360456,il protection still active permanent loss dont protect
360457,database even working launching phone world mean
360458,like samsung would launch diesel engine car display
360459,lmao phone blockchain validates something traditionally organized orgs sure they'll stupid things attempt bandwagon get publicity
360460,means database starts working phone thatll massie competitive advantage
360461,phone competitive advantage blockchain space
360462,eli5 
360463,database starts working primary area expertise broken they're going add new completely different area endeavor think going positive result
360464,abuilt hardware wallet integrates natively point sales systems real life payments would huge advantage
360465,shutdown solana directly phone dedicated button 
360466,called crypto debit card attached apple pay
360467,
360468,one take weird crypto token hell outside blockchain space even knows sol works everyone even build entire phone
360469,works centralized entities though built payment infrastructure circumvents entire traditional system thatd excellent
360470,advantage think phone offers people currently using solana
360471,solana decentralized
360472,celsius withdrew 2000 ether bancor actually got 1200 making snark permanent loss impermanent loss bancor still working designed
360473,excellent question forget phone offers people use solana moment bought ecosystem fully
360474,native ability crypto tx without really garbage third party apps hope
360475,mean
360476,literally wallet software free phone attached
360477,loss going discreptancy 
360478,actually il bnt tanked cover il turned il protection think
360479,wanted tx say pos stephangoss mentioned p2p tx anything else jump fifty hoops
360480,need produce entire tiny computer run single app
360481,os literally software attached piece hardware lol nonsensical critique
360482,phone everything apps already best thing changes backend users could care less
360483,os runs one application people already make phones oses run applications need make phone run single app
360484,argument feels like someone explaining touch screen phones dumb feature phones fine 
360485,blockchains host one application
360486,get phone wait actually can't solana functioning 
360487,basically suggesting move back feature phones
360488,yeah feel like 2008 tbh
360489,general purpose phone run whatever app want including nonshit wallet app
360490,still need pos support everyone go route
360491,ape phone something current one cannot gated access app apk would work elsewhere
360492,able tons headache vs able easily natively sets adoption vs obsolescence apart software
360493,people use phones much making blockchain transactions one sad phone native support making crypto tx
360494,argument one sirin brockshane phones let's pretend there's meaningful leap going
360495,everything current phone need carry 2 phones need another phone next project
360496,said built android would obviously able everything else
360497,oh come like meme someone lists 20 steps necessary pay bill check including licking stamp putting stamp envelope separate steps open app phone blockchain shit netflix button phone
360498,feel like kneejerk culture war replies rn thoughtful commentary tbh
360499,thoughtful commentary provided single reason phone optimized way run blockchain client would better existing phone run app including blockchain client
360500,look rates repayment bills send check instead use cc via website 1000% increase debt repayment kind make point yes
360501,yeah feels like solana dumb therefore everything hated us
360502,problem less flaws solana selling phone
360503,lol yeah literally point take 20 steps pay bill takes many steps deliberately name muscle movement step
360504,explain cheap seats exactly gain dedicated phone task vs app launched phone
360505,remember we're talking android tons room screw around os features
360506,hardware need support current phones
360507,think simplify phone mine cant cant current worth much 
360508,point something possible like paying bill method headache like sending checks mean gets done well something easier app go phones rn makes possible crypto tx get adoption could bc headache decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal ergo good idea solana probably useful general crypto adoption
360509,native implementation os
360510,said words concrete information exactly would different app running os vs existing one
360511,need make hardware
360512,idk plan could envisage number things native implementation would look like would make life easier i'm utilizing crypto day day basis
360513,name two
360514,target market solana users
360515,ability natively tap send money via solana chain friend next ability use biometrics confirm tx native browser yield farming
360516,1 done today android 2 requires browser support done current android devices
360517,use case im excited able add addresses able use nft payment instore payment terminals like apple wallet instead running credit card system submits signs blockchain transaction saves merchant 3% credit card fees
360518,originally answering someone's question someone using solana daily get yeah
360519,name two
360520,two sucked
360521,see earlier points already done bad argument headache
360522,hell could launch wallet app ios tapped nfc tag
360523,exists solana user using iphone andor samsung idea dump devices
360524,think build os
360525,explained needs hardware yet hard parts development users would get good experience developers hard work need entire new device
360526,right cant process via blockchain
360527,maybe they'd movs next phone change
360528,sure could metamask exists
360529,doesnt certainly interesting approach might actually end good ux
360530,earth would
360531,giving apps benefit get
360532,i've actually said defended needs hardware look back i've talked exclusively os native implementation
360533,interesting handwaving app launches hit nfc tag app controls experience
360534,saying hardware bad idea either btw thought natural place quick debate someone
360535,os level features exist today need implemented work properly
360536,hard customize android os tons things user customization
360537,arguments making applies pretty much every major innovation last 20 years
360538,wanna ad hominem please take way around adult iphone first came mp3 players came chance
360539,even close true
360540,yes
360541,see parallels
360542,noise around samsung offered sdk interact ethereum
360543,maybe argued walkmen need mp3 players phones apps like weird one tmobile need apple app store
360544,course
360545,20 years ago comparisons dubious leap phones today whatever phone offering
360546,noise though asking genuine question seems like convo i've twenty years people entrenched systems
360547,obviously parallel mp3 players enabled something possible optical media tons problems magnetic media mp3 players easy response question i'm asking carry entire album pocket go running without skipping rewind possible existing tech iphone first phone browser actually worked touchscreen responsive enough navigate web page app
360548,reinventing anything whatever they're supposed offer something already
360549,would possibly know even launched yet 
360550,like seen 2007 presentation jobs gave
360551,worse people buy phones order interact brockshane interaction simply one things
360552,laid extremely compelling case wanted iphone obvious anyone watching presentation world changed
360553,either shouting possible rim
360554,watched thing live night shift
360555,iphone example inaccurate using browsers phones years iphone iphone made easier accessible key
360556,like selling new brand hyping connection internet phone seriously connects internet faster phone
360557,think normies get minting useless nfts directly
360558,something already possible argument development
360559,obvious iphone browser differed featurephone browsers
360560,last time watched product announcement
360561,came
360562,obvious demo
360563,thing anything really announced crapping lol
360564,clearly watch presented
360565,cupertino dude
360566,okay bathroom browser demo
360567,well fact using android already makes conclusion fairly easy draw
360568,familiar particular topic that's reminiscent days months heard type stuff people actually got experience phone
360569,solana phone changing world giving normies experienced obsessively documenting lives anew device they'll chain
360570,decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal 
360571,fact quite obvious thing lived demo going change everything question whether would live demo yes people said need anyway sure even demo compelling features
360572,think people went buy samsung phones
360573,could argue whether needed pinch zoom whatever whether wanted hardware keyboard made actual claims thing could want
360574,uhhh maybe it'll better integration nfc support
360575,represent solana idea thing lol
360576,limited information
360577,put away breathless praise governance model announce something substantial produced
360578,we're making phone standard traditional organizational bullshit
360579,i'm discussing crypto native phone could potentially useful least view think solana wise going arena although doubts they'll able deliver
360580,least hardware hard
360581,actually mentioned anything phone could potentially useful beyond current phones well enough though there's part experience made better oslevel integration
360582,must different levels patience crypto apps phones
360583,find exceptionally irritating experience
360584,yeah os problem apps
360585,would nice stopped pretending they're breaking new ground something one recent history done
360586,decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal 
360587,think people went buy samsung phones
360588,we're agreement app
360589,know least
360590,please post receipts
360591,said beginning arguing os app hardware per se
360592,right well described anything needs os support improve
360593,unhappy current crypto apps cool make better app
360595,os level support needed someone able give example right
360596, think we're likely agree think ivangbi gonna get irritated circular arguments eventually lol
360597,cryptospecific desktop oses mean issues apply
360598,please finalize ur arguments 130 messages haha sorry 3
360599,reason cryptospecific many things
360600,decent os native implementation good hardware security stuff actually matters brand name market experience captive audience much revenue think samsung got
360601,make custom rom work hardware available
360602,yes better crypto integration os level it'd neato
360603,agree approach making phone
360604,though
360605,anyone know valuation stepn raised
360606,
360607,use xpubkey calculate used addresses iirc
360608,need os dos
360609,features start 100 points must justify existence beyond 100 points
360610,want see another software company pretend hardware fail crypto crypto separate issue
360611,ivan going ban say last time one named single os feature would improve apps obviously need custom os improve apps
360612,support something natively build better optimized things without bunch hamfisting
360613,i'm clearly talking people know nothing software hardware oses everyone keeps saying support natively means anything
360614,know user code runs processor right access hardware os
360615,3 minutes lights
360616,tell getting frustrated isis dis de wei make point others
360617,also know oses module support enabling code loaded kernel enables native support without writing entire new os
360618,native support replacing bios efi installing new tpm chip need entirely new processor architectures
360619,cool that's one approach go 4 whoever i'm advocating reinventing wheel
360620,nobody said os built scratch explicitly said based android
360621,kind 3 minutes cut thread 
360622,think involves separating tpg rpi tbh sum comes even able calculate native psus
360624,selling point new phone brand allows connect brockshane directly yet vague definition directly covered phones work today well hope lot money keep manufacturers alive
360625,fruit phone iphone samsung bkk everybody else 
360627,ok basta take dms blz
360628,let's dm ivangbi arguments per instruction p
360629,
360630,misleading refundable 100usdc deposit
360631,yeah
360632,ship til q1 2023 kind like people putting deposits tesla truck public show interest

360645,4 4 little
360646,iirc
360647,like first last 4 essential course 4 4
360648,maybe random chance several characters scattered throughout also ping similar enough skimming entire address might still accept

360650,dont use convex
360651,random chance
360652,made sure it'd look metamask

360961,anyone else starting get annoyed whole 3acs fault narrative whole point hedge fund get leverage take massive risks yes sometimes trade moves blows anyone blame contagion lenders shitty decision making job make low risk loans liquidated minimal loss clearly failed assuming theres fraud dont think ive seen evidence lenders getting tricked 3ac failed job didnt enough diligence got greedy screwed
360962,evidence fraud
360963,think 3ac least mislead lenders agree principle likely lenders fault well looks like greed got better sides situation 3ac seems deserve blame
360964,evidence actual fraud faked documents etc obviously point doesnt stand lenders job mislead double check claims made
360965,got loans false pretences moved clients funds without permission according reports
360966,false pretenses fake documents lenders failed check claims
360967,saying trust im rich bank double checking requiring documentation isnt thing fraud
360968,still fraud though
360969,get conclusive evidence increasingly looks like acted way could considered fraud legally problem basically hearsay involved parties gets put legal documents
360970,lenders space probably learned lesson i'd worry much
360971,yeah thats feeling situation well theres real evidence could discovery take years fraud feels likely lenders didnt job
360972,making exaggerated claims isnt fraud although obviously unethical faking documents prove exaggerated claims
360973,couch legal
360975,fair enough probably also stop blaming 3ac whole mess without actual evidence anyways horse race woke twitter feed bunch dumb finger pointing got annoyed 
360976,mean they're still blame risk took justifiable given size fact trading borrowed money known better sure
360977,ah yeah thats disagree take ever risks want assuming hedge fund clearly disclosed investors going anything taking big risks
360980,yup hedge funds blow time people raise new money open next one anything remarkable took long blow
360982,depends acted towards lenders especially writing rest debatable subjective wont reach conclusion

361114,time buy rrapes send public figures like much
361115,points decentralized protocols working rwas lot common tradfi working rwas necessity thing decentralized protocol working rwas practice that's fundamental contradiction context makerdao onchain make decentralized protocol anymore usdc decentralized smart contract wrapping real world asset
361116,that's narrow definition decentralization
361117,rwas suitable cefi lending platforms decentralised protocols
361118,mean seen
361119,thinking exactly i'm referring adding blockchain mux make decentralized anymore google decentralized underlying internet
361120,experiences using coinbase card worth
361121,decentralized financial systems existed blockchain know
361122,impossible goal
361123, babe cancel movie tonight never leave house sorry babe ppl lobsterdao arguing meaning decentralization
361124,say already exists i'm asking think point makerdao
361125,think goldfinch guys pretty much bridging deficefi divide offering undercollateralized credit real businesses crypto bunch em's checkout duneit's rocketship imo
361126,making successful decentralized lending protocol think i'm super deep maker

361166,product useful depends i'd still using cexs worried waking disingenuous notification send dna sample suspicious activity pretend cexs somehow sort decentralized thingamajig
361167,totally buy argument onchain def way proxy decentralization what's end game like pure play decentralized play opinion
361168,what's end game like pure play decentralized play opinion asking think pure decentralized app would look like end goal
361169,good question mention actually
361170, liquity uni v2v3 pretend governance exist practice alternative current system keyword alternative believe everyone use crypto needs onboarded able onboarded crypto end fewer actual users population us crypto failing something
361171,woah that's quite crack current prevailing bull case maxis lol
361172,personally feel there's strong real world use case blockchain crypto currencies irl starters think accounting frauds nailed perhaps tracked much faster corporate ledgers blockchain educational certs health records etc seem better use case chain irl seems quite case bull
361173,i'm discounting case real world decentralized currency look mammoth inflation windfall leave things regulators generally bode well totally feel need decentralized global reserve currency dunno btc answer least immediately need well founded imo
361174,first i'd say first i'm guessing referring public blockchains well imagine paying cash meant giving recipient friends meticulous detailed record every person that's held note well every transaction made wallet note came coincidentally potentially net worth transparency sound like something corporate going particularly interested imo
361175,stance change company publicly listed shareholders institutional buyers retailers
361176,easy api lets query twitter social graph follows
361177,like tool lets view cluster social graph
361178,corporate part sure would 
361179,educational frauds big people impersonating degrees showing public domain uncommon many quacks practicing doc treating actual patients maybe much us mature markets hard reality many parts world outside makes lot sense bringing certain transparency system
361180,well that's capital invested corporate cracker siphoning away funds i'd sure heck want know also listed corporate net worth's already public number
361181,anyone know good research articles possible cases uncollateralized loans defi
361184,dont know id suggest look state art onchain repitation systems sbts etc uncollateralized loans truly permissionless system possible reputation track records imho
361185,applies non 100% collateralized
361187,need realtime public database inadvertently leaks every users transactional history thing credentials inherently purview whoever giving credentials one reason may need able revoke blockchain would act data store
361188,oh yeah heard something read thx
361189,thats defi thing though undercoll loans arguably even really possible defi tradfi sense word normal use cases undercollateralized loans
361190,ivan said would pretty much reason would tradfi need moniez thing replace money whatever crypto asset thing probably nfts
361192,yes course liability ensure loan repaid assuming system question worst pseudonymous

361733,identify open interest sudden massive increase usdt shorts
361735,might right speedy maybe fttbnb real usdt trade 
361736,problem idenitfying expesive shorting without clear timeline
361737,ie even u knew luna abou tto go celsius can't pay would cheaper short btc

361766,go google paper tarun et al
361767,thanks describe current available mechanics
361768,first affliate links shilling eos vitalik got liquidated last weekend
361769,thought joke apparently lol 
361771,little update world numio want check weve 
361772,
361773,ftx looking buy robinhood

361775,
361776,paper find protocol mechanics currently available 
361781,robinhood 62b cash balance sheet mcap 8b right sam already owns 76% one entity iirc think would require decent premium deal comes fruition fwiw
361782,vlad type dump market weakness well seed terra definitely crypto latest defi wallet announcement indicates really wanna try get involved space well
361783,going lose money less 2 years sir
361784,sold discount sbf degen might pay premium
361785,operating massive loss every quarter moment
361786,ledger live support optimism arbitrum via wallet connect
361789,vlad baiju majority stake50% report states talks internal within ftx yeah pfof revenue disappears might make sense get deal done
361790,vlad good person selling data hedge funds halting trading retail public squeezes nice guy
361791,anybody know sure androidmetamaskledger works
361792,sorry prob lame question someone share experience using gmxyz looks like fb's ui unsure what's web3 factor get paid post something lol
361793,get much money
361794,somehow lower crypto prices go cash rich sbf gets math
361795,lmao much like talking 89b
361796,sure seems highly unlikely founders 50% shares dumping retail since listing btw sec insider sells public
361797,burning man part lets know dealing chrome browser extension linkedin searches would useful know whos burner isnt thats center universe various intelligentsia getting kompromat tech founders early trajectory still people go act like fools inside ecochamber everyone else normie doesnt get vc backers love arrogance exuberance fuels exit liquidity lps cult atmosphere almost encouraged average crypto plebeian doesnt 10k go trip acid brock pierce band merry weirdos looks like big classist secret handshake club wrapped virtue signaling know saying thats looks like outside looking
361798,8% 8% multiclass structure might hold significantly voting power
361799,sam benevolent man crypto speak ill grand design
361800,robinhoods dual class structure means shares sold retail investors institutions carry one vote shares held cofounders vlad tenev baiju bhatt carry 10 votes per share
361802,surprises lot much hate gets looks even trying save blockfi customers assets morgan creek trying save investors share former seems better approach industry whole even might benefit financially future
361804,indeed would kind bizarre man much face effective altruism closet megalomaniac
361805,definitely would suck based track record red flag see yet
361806,
361807,hood ftx's ceo active conversations robinhood rtrs livesquawk
361808,psa there's serious bug metamask right careful submitting transactions cost 6 figures investigating
361809,initiate transaction random wallet address without 0x start 64 characters instead 66
361810,here's vitalik's example ab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b
361811,act going send usdc usdt weth
361812,click submit take look final wallet metamask would send tokens lmk match pasted
361813,would send funds instead entered 
361814,sure longer adds 0x says invalid address something seriously wrong
361815,address empty tho
361816,yeah example try wallet address
361817,would people send transactions without 0x
361818,metamask used add 0x automatically
361819,seems like unusual scenario
361820,certain exchanges show without 0x
361821,copy pasting address could get screwed
361822,sent adress without 0x went random one
361823,yeah
361824,used add 0x needed try metamask mobile says invalid address something like
361825,desktop version makes random address that's tx goes
361826,64 character address goes one specific random wallet address
361827,weird
361828,0x prefix indicate number hexadecimal rather base ethereum addresses hexadecimal
361829,still reason make random wallet address explain happens certain tokens others weird overall
361830,sending eth adds 0x
361831,tokens
361832,specifically usdc usdt weth
361833,looked anything else
361834,
361835,prefixing probably tries see ens name
361836,could metamask add prefix sending eth sending weth
361837,tokens would one thing clearly software bug tons ppl replicated
361838,clue bro linking cn etherscan assuming ur china sure chrome ext work wall
361839,lol cn etherscan works better
361840,i'm us
361841,version running
361842,chrome metamask u report issue
361843,recent 10151
361844,yeah reported thought clipboard virus given everyone else replicate well clearly
361845,uhh using mobile
361846,link
361847,happened desktop
361848,reported directly email chain wanted logs whatnot sure there's public place report
361849,report issue
361850,email support always useless
361851,would assets secure lobster
361852,somewhere else
361853,github
361854,
361858,recent events bail rather consolidation much larger institutional players
361859,site mate
361860,satire
361861,winners chosen preselected level placed execute larger mission mission may even fully understand yet handlers happy guide towards desired outcomes saying hes plant much useful tool done new ones take place eagerly
361862,institutional capital manipulating markets consolidate assets equity nothing new another douchebagel bidding whether knowingly unknowingly
361863,original twitt dont much writer true seems like ftx taking celsius might allow depositors get money back 
361864,wut
361865,called raising cash euphoric levels using everyone else ded
361866,conspiracy business
361867,conspiracy rich people consolidating wealth ever
361868,rich people lost money rich people consolidating wealth
361869,breaking money buys stuff
361870,breaking hands dont stop posting random shit mfka
361871,ps joining joke bans good
361872,nice nary another motive sight remind pretending serial opportunist prolific pd'r anything
361873,copium bag bias mostly
361874,can't bull run without billionaire haloed
361875,ofc business usual isnt depositors getting back money better share holders bailed even depositors supposed know risks taking majority never thought would happen blockfi marketing played role side share holders know risks taking ie losing money blockfi shouldnt surprise
361876,may better depending persuasion sure good excuse start pretending nice altruistic guy sticking poor unsuspecting users
361877,someone blind bat see he's bailing us retail order mitigate contaigon set stage ftx growing take seem controversial y'all arguing thing
361878,sure referring er okay guess
361882,agree much effectsdesigns better simple direct quiet voice lower music would professional way
361883,articles uniswap routing possible
361884,hear opinions best dex guys evaluating choose 1 would kpis metrics look deceiving eg trading volume consist big % indirect trades big % mev transactions 50% trading volume real
361887,looks like conversation bots gotten upgrade 
361888,oh co founder md co founder always model hehe final year medical student lol
361889,good noted first day 
361890,yes im md 
361891,adding anyone saw article mev volumeprofit chains eth big difference like tps gas fees latency affect much mev bots profit anything ethereum less mev bots know actually asking cuz looking dex world one big problems arbmev bots also far oracle informed amms solved issue
361894,gainzy tg
361895,
361898,another pleb would want express opinion sbfs inner motives share valuable opinion rotting ban section forever much pleb crap start permamuting
361899,thread mev eth l2 
361900,please found mention chains eth would glad
361901,thread pretty good 
361902,think mev days nice vids
361903, 22 cross domain mev looking
361904,
361905,wanna make clear much clown moron
361906,dont need discuss need understood
361907,john wang got one 
361913,hey toby updates situation
361915,1password goated
361916,1password also use mac think supposed best
361917,keepassxc 
361919,dashlane
361920,best software list actually true open source choose keepassxxc speaking centralised services id chose bitwarden
361921,1password function store see phrase password etc whether trust 1p personally sure whether anyone else experience share
361923,page storing crypto wallets 1 password looks like
361924,hell naw pw seed stays paper
361925,open source 300 contributors github 13k stars good going code shadysuspicious project
361926,1password tutorial phantom wallet solana want look get opionion
361927,hello please need help hacked sent mexc anyone contacts could help
361928,wow disingenuous take warned see message wait bonder liquidity alternatively wait l2 exit window learn withdraw manually via contracts bridged anyway call rug clout important svanevik attacking good trustless protocols clout
361930,idc dex trade slippage doesnt bother kek
361931,thoguths watchpug audit firm yes controlled fd
361932,relatively good unproven reputation they've gotta prove established meaning fuck they're donezo audit carefully however could limited reputation work bad hard say either way
361933,ty ser
361934,literally didnt warn ui anymore took 27 hours complete bridging dude flicked switch advertised quick trustless im one whos disingenuous understand takes time build products garbage user experience cant one
361935,
361936,literally reason anyone uses hop launched token desperate attempt stay relevant get exit liquidity bull market wound shit optimism functioned fine yrs without one use stargate anyswap instead
361937,anyswap one expensive bridges depending swap would rather check bridges many people talk better liquidity less fee usually hyped bridges sucks never used stargate tho
361938,tried bridge plasma finance
361939,compare fees
361940,run bitwarden server
361941,anyone recommend captcha bot tg channel would allow custom question
361942,dosen't open issue old repo 
361943,anyone recommend service check smartcontracts scam honeypot etc
361944,miss something since following famous people prove security
361945,
361946,
361947,
361949,yea attest plasma finance bridge great
361950,say famous account follows project dosen't mean safeit's bad metric
361951,additionally would public figure assoicate pw manager trust gives info potential attack
361952,true messed warnings ui calling trustless noncustodial protocol rug still disingenuous also talking guy sending around tokens disingenuous hes calling withdraw function smart contract every user including could also message sends different message ultimately send users bridges less trustless yea ux fucked sucks messaging misleading shame account reach
361953,withdrawals usually happen automatically via bonders overwhelmed messed handle transactions numbers day large number transactions last year manual withdrawals escape latches dont depend bonders fuck
361955,assuming wallet mean create new account option within metamask makes wallets share seed one compromised short answer yes
361956,passphrase necessarily seed means password one types order unlock metamask
361957,yeah bad speak classic metamask unlock password changes everything
361959,seed phrase gets stolen wallets derived compromised individual private keys generated based seed phrase according fixed rules anyone seed phrase generate private keys wallets like mean metamask password seed phrase still 100% clear talking usually enter seed phrase anywhere computer need move funds asap
361960,2 things heremetamask requires setup new phrasepassword onboarding phrasepassword 1 setup hardware wallet new phrasepassword onboarding that's phrasepassword 2 import hardware wallet metamask password 1 used unlock metamask expose hardware wallet phrasepassword 2
361963,passphrase passphrase different thing
361964,unlocking metamask account
361965,unless misunderstood basically one relation another
361967,ah sorry maybe talking something specific trezor scuzi rest case
361969,also add metemorphic contract contract detector 
361970,
361971,
361972,nope theyre still investigating
361973,thats pretty crazy long gets packaged eip sold next generation contract upgradeability
361974,maker governance voting invest 500 million us treasury bills
361975,rebrand usdo already
361976,lets democratise metamorphism 
361977,probably since they're planning getting rid selfdestruct
361978,would break metamorphic smart contracts
361979,rather prevent redeploying address
361980,usdd oh wait taken oh wait nobody care
361981,
361983,eip getting implemented though
361984,probably verkle trees state implemented
361985,would like see ever implemented production environment uses create2selfdestruct loops heavily sandbox value storage cant see actually implemented knowledge benefits former practice spread
361986,important question needs production environment outweigh needs many good sir
361987,benefit
361988,hard fork bricks lots money wont popular hard fork 
361989,create2selfdestruct clear abuse hole ethereum design closed
361990,good luck forking away
361991,less gas intensive far safer paradigm value storage currently accepted practices
361992,brick alot money according eip sendall still used retrieve funds
361993,blow meta transactions though
361994,create2 reverts contract already exists
361995,gas made measure want save real money costs makes sense simplify nodes remove dubious opcodes raise gas limit
361996,understand please explain eip bricks alot money
361997,process quite simple predict new contract location using create2 determinism send tokens contract address contract exploit ready withdraw deploy contract address retreive tokens call selfdestruct save gas
361999,contract already exists address selfdestruct bricked create2 reverts iirc
362000,says exactly eip
362001,applications affected change use breaks contract recreated address using create2 selfdestruct
362002,using faulty metric performance must measured gas proportional gas limit
362003,holes like create2selfdestruct prevent consensus radically raising gas limit
362004,contract never deployed onchain blocks dramatically reduce gas expenditures incurred single transaction
362005,able implement check avoid redeploy somewhere else
362006,upgradeable system good code designed immutable possible
362007,get rugged something implemented designed
362008,exactly bad eip
362009,even auditors started recommending selfdestructing clone pattern secure
362010,almost equivalent permanently locking liquidity uniswap v1 rage left dead v2 v2 getting rekt v3 though fortunately v3 go expected department almost worse
362011,create2selfdestruct never intended pattern fact abuse hole design prevent closing said hole
362012,intention irrelevant
362013,getting bricked relevant either
362014,yeah designed acceptable paradigm chain looking like evm wants pull rug anyways firmly opposed eip people's money stake can't change rules game implemented poor design begin people followed design
362015,supposedly immutable platform building immutable contracts
362016,funny stuff
362017,ethereum never gave promise evm ever change
362018,lol
362019,pattern challenges fabric immutability user's pov though
362020,somehow we're applying frontier opcodegas rules today 
362021,fair assumption methods allowed value stored accessed change feet
362022,perhaps away apparent farce immutable contracts knows unexpectedness needing hardfork discover future eh
362023,certainly think anyone used system assumption evm might make changes made value inaccessible
362024,except sload gas tweaked one time brick someone
362025,dont think true give promise understandble things change
362026,far know eip still draft seems like people want things change appear foregone conclusion
362027,last checked design pretty much finalized discussed allcoredevs
362028,point sendall allow siphoning residual value
362029,case perhaps consider changes behavior create2 well
362030,lowlevel change bricks least one valuestorage system exactly good look particularly none done desire exploit anything increase security
362031,platform building static contracts next hardfork good base
362032, least 70k contracts impacted
362033,people cry cruft things like windows js would much rather twist elaborate pretzels knowingly going ahead bricking functioning programs oops unexpected interaction
362034,perhaps vitalik losing wow thingy justified never promised permanence
362035,kind interesting looking metamorphic contracts disdain contracts use mechanism although metamorphic
362036,breaking one use case would likely necessitate breaking
362037,that's like saying get rid delegatecall upgradeble contracts used rug
362038,nobody's saying
362039,reason behind gettting rid pave way verkle trees rugs taken consideration
362040,participated first week arbitrum odyssey bridged arbitrum using hop protocol claim nft funny enough get nfts polygon information coming weeks found 
362041, fraxusdc official base pool
362042,question asking verkle tree worth bricking contracts whether flaw ethereum superfluous imho
362043,bridgeless protocols like magpie mitigate bridging hacks bridgless mechanism
362046,good cryptoweb3 research sources offering data driven deep dives like messaridelphiblock without paywall hard find organised source
362047,lots different blogs newsletters compendium may help 
362049,btw need selfdestruct omit selfdestruct part
362051,code already live use months
362052,
362053,sandboxed counterfactual storage systems rely selfdestruct effectively function removed create2 changed revert existing contracts would brick system
362054,wish ill upon title leading strongest security defi article possible matter time going eating hat ser blockchain security far complex use superlative language
362055,interesting tech nonetheless certainly innovative maybe frame increased security comparative vaults
362056,already dealt result long upgrade process ensure hacks would far difficult pull complexity steal value rather o1 pretty good valuestorage systems go said appreciate feedback 
362057,
362058,jesus
362059,see would safe redeploy contract many times opposed simply deploying using
362060,time contract token storage address lowers surface area dramatically
362061,contract deployed fairly trivial run trace get code unless expect script kiddies know etherscan
362062,actually etherscan supports parity traces point invalid
362063,lower surface area code closed source 
362064,fewer points exist attackable vectors
362065,contracts live single transaction open attacks outside transaction
362067,kind take three guys building space since years innovative protocols first smart contract wallet 2019 cross chain messaging hop protocol connext pivoted bridge hops model works building things worked smart contract auditors launched token recent crypto crash hop already used l2 bridge bull market anyswap stargate token ever saw performance days process 100000 transactions remember waiting hours funds anyswap bridge fantom craze suspect us scroll back chat take seriously

362085,average position prolly 38x leveraged
362086,hi guys since pinata ipfs gateway changing pricing model expected expenses pins bandwidth going increase 23 1000 per month i'm looking reliable alternatives interested host pinner thing guys recommend infura
362087,23% annualized funding 3x leverage pretty attractive tbh
362088,yeah exactly imagine articles recently psyops squeeze last juices retail 
362089,100mln total oi added recently
362090,dont think hedge funds lol
362091,fleek moralis
362092,prolly attractive bet outside using aave
362093,attractive gonna short tether
362094,gets interesting like 2b oi someone waits thin book punts market order considering cost resting orders ask even 1
362095,merged ticket one seems like they're aware issue working fix 
362096,anyone insight get reimbursed metamask sure even process place need get lawyer
362097,reimbursed metamask
362098,yeah due bug introduced transaction misrouted random wallet address tokens make destination
362099,er bug introduce
362100,
362101,used create token transfer transaction send screen tokentransferaddress value txparams undefined data undefined const txmeta await promisifiedbackgroundaddunapprovedtransaction txparams originmetamask type previously would create token transfer via libraries depend ethjsabi validation hex string would fail user able send transaction change referenced validation stopped
362102,well good luck reading original thread knowingly sending tokens nonaddress certainly interesting action
362103,
362104,crust

362106,lol ok share idk see lil moon un block lmfao
362107,coming post aside hate telegram expansion links properly anymore
362108,
362109,twitter that's issues
362110,sure whats ur twitter
362111,telegram
362113,need play around cruft stick end links get show preview
362114,done lol
362116,processes didnt change issue didnt occur recent release identified happened rolling back validation removal
362117,didnt send anything non address perfectly valid address changed different address sending process
362118,there's 0x address
362119,didnt go burn address went completely different address entered
362120,can't fathom thank stars get rekt normally mistake
362121,validated addresses properly release
362122,compensated
362123,could certainly argue rejected first tx made leading think continue damn risk tolerance must roof
362124,yeas coiner said github tab took screenshot
362125,good article flashbots work post merge
362126,came across discussion google seem like concrete path maybe reading outdated articles
362132,one uncommon core eth merge episodes good bit discussion
362133,ey pay 100 mln settle us charges staff cheating accountant exams article comments
362134,hilarious bit
362135,
362136,companies basically far gone practical backstop reasons like substantial hole balance sheet regulatory issues much business left saved says bankmanfried declined name specific crypto exchanges
362137,
362138,forbes truly forefront breaking news
362139,nice article
362141, bear markets great bringing drama people completely forgot
362142,gensler even lift finger
362143,surprised one else developed point
362144,aave usdc pegged 1 usd positions liquidation mode 
362145,aave peg usdc used reference asset eg euler weth 'pegged' equal 1 weth everything measured units
362147,chainlink
362148,always
362149,worked intended
362150,ah see
362151,weth ethereum weth avalanche another chain
362152,yep totally agree
362153,entirely different assets need objective pricing
362154,can't continue pull shit intended rep loss
362155,aave gov seems ok oracle assumption lmeow
362156,nobody evaluates bridged asset security people wanna ape 
362157,yep really bugs people say deploy euler chains asap 'easy' different security models 'same' assets objectively see
362158,potential solution could check another oracle checks peg eth locked assets native chain locked assets peg breaks operations allowed spitballing def really interesting worth tackling tbh
362160,stop using chainlink push report correctly chain's data
362161,either implement specific weight price coming x chain chain something else
362162,would easier check chainlink well local amm use lower two prices borrowing
362163,basically pulling data cexes add 50% weight native dex chain native usdc use
362164,would hugely problematic lower liquidity chains cause whole slew even worse issues
362165,cant really differentiate native chain price expect using onchain values youre prone manipulations lot onchain pricing prone towards one solution implement another check bridged assets oracle reports locked supply eg eth matches circulating supply eg harmony
362166,exchange gives native usdcharmony pricing
362167,doesnt really solve issue youre adding manipulation vector
362168,told everybody need manipulate illiquid shitcoin pair shitty chain force price downup counts exchanges report
362169,preach
362170,anyone explain loans work
362171,oracle ser would price wrapped asset moment underlying bridge hacked fast think make assessment badly particular wrapped asset affected quickly ever come consensus oracle nodes
362172,question vpepo
362173,sorry shameless plug anyone wants try akula beacon chain ropsten got experimental branch available 
362174,feel brave check vorot93merge branch try chainropsten
362175,forget bring beacon chain node preferably lighthouse
362176,anybody know leveraged basis trading works lemma finance wrote article year ago basically saying 2x leverage basis trading btc outperformed holding btc cant figure even leveraged basis trade 
362177,first need ask fundamental question price anything usually people say 'whatever someone willing pay it' metric need find recent trade asset question wrapped bridge asset need find price someone paid bridged asset underlying asset network actual derivative that's truly correct way complain there's way chainlink etc could expected bridge assets right can't fragmenting liquidity bridging bad news everyone breaks fungibility assets 1 wrapped abc never worth exactly 1 abc there's almost always discount needs applied liquidity risk cost wrapunwrap opportunity cost bridged assets basis we've seen past 1218 months wrapped tokens worth much less average underlying fix think without custom oracles every asset personally think solution therefore lies decentralised oracles derived underlying dex group dexs native environment something trades way always getting 'real' price easy create secure decentralised oracle uniswap twaps bad think better we've working euler

362231,sers seen thoughts share plebs like
362234,idea safe anymore us bonds cos even makerdao buying em 
362236,fud 20
362237,yea wana know anyone clarity insights thats
362238,relationship usdc circle signature silvergate public guess issue signature silvergate lend shady people default repayments
362239,signaturesilvergate effectively get 5% discount vs dollars buying usdc
362240,almost decade tether scam usdc ends one get rekt would insert irony gif
362241,4d fud
362242,ss buy usdc form circle 95 cents dollar ss lend usdc platforms one s's goes poof means dollar liqudity could issue usdc guess anything i'm missing
362243,last part issue geralt davidson cryptoinsider23 5h im crypto insider need tell what's going behind curtain really bad dirty secret kept quiet crypto hedge funds big guys careful blows peace 
362244,one become one crypto insiders need 500 twitter followers
362245,haha ct anything said wana check gigabrains views insights whats said
362246,u need big ego small penis
362247,damn 12 wish ego bigger
362248,forgot twitter acc promised upload tg data 
362249,see approximate amount eth stored smart contract
362250,gigabrain see anything obviously new signature goes due defaults usdc they've lent yeah it'd bad usdc insurmountable long get another partner see would worldending especially given tether run years busd alternative really trusting cz maybe people smarter weigh
362251,cool thanks weighing appreciate 2cents given
362252,gigabrain make
362253,busd run partnership paxos might reliant cz afaik paxos holds collateral etc
362254,guy spent 3 years retweeting binance czbusd intern working hard
362255,lmao anon acc small one rting cz 3 years somehow getting alpha biggest player market smells like lot hot garbage
362256,hi tokemak protocol feature named toke backstop afak means toke staked users used cover impermanent loss lps tokemak anyone know users toke used purpose recent market crash cant find info dune andor tokemaks dashboard il mitigated reality
362257,usdc reserve assets held blackrock others transparent audited frequently credible auditors graphic tweet shows flow authors speculate happen usdc issuance counterparty risk 'high risk lenders' would born intermediaries silvergate circle interest incentives circle lose ie marketing costs would paid circle balance sheet usdc reserve assets
362258,sounds awfully close bancors model
362259,im following logic circle would give ss 5% discount service supposedly provide
362260,quite dumb fud since usdc circle also attestations
362261,
362262,discloses acquired 480 bitcoins since may 3rd june 28 2022 microstrategy together subsidiaries held aggregate 129699 bitcoins
362263,source 
362264,yeh 480 btc huge
362265,followerwhoring tried true
362266,bancor everything paired bnt tokemak nothing paired toke impact 2nd order magnitude
362267,since we're talking user's staked toke toke's emission bad also toke backstop one step mitigation waterfall use assets reserve assets surplus toke staked protocol owned assets think much better bancor still interesting toke users suffered last crash
362268,answer scroll twitter account see consists random retweets public crypto accounts several years great insider revealing hisher secrets right
362269,imo somewhat slick graphic tells followerbait idk working
362272,regulated
362274,access harmony vrf within smart contract i'm unable understand docs
362275,absolutely none actually anything works joke
362276,afaik tether fully audited point they've said times they'll releasing one think i've ever come across actually fulfilling logic consistent usdt usdc imo
362277,correct attestations made 3rd party looks accounts minute need longer term transparent figure borrow meet needs auditor one day can't months end
362278,whats dumb read 10k silver gate see financial activity made sense would visible public docs signet usdc settlement layer settles usd cant borrow signet dumb must getting towards bottom quality posts reaching idiotic levels
362279,
362280,yeah saw
362282,
362283,
362284,claim goes they're decentralization decentralized cosmos chain slow cosmos chain
362285,head way run orderbook starknet follow much dydx story use read true 
362286,decentralization also term used protocols please legislators issuing tokens they'll able say look dydx users use token fees validators one goes security
362287,certainly they'd like say whether holds water debate consider lbry chain properties currently fighting sec thinks they're security
362288,know abou curious starknet vs polygon scaling solutions
362289,lobs sandwich service providers already common contracts like uni curve one still monitor mempool create bundle
362290,thanks sharing never heard lbry i'll look dydx stating website dydx token staking done safety staking pool dydx stakers earn rewards securing system users securing they're depositing tokens vault earning part trading fees' revenue words dydx holders buying dydx staking regards future trading fee revenue may take part 
362291,polygon l1 moment
362292,they're getting trading fees they're compensated brrr act backstop liquidity margin calls afaik
362293,chain exists today even cosmos support want 
362294,cosmos allows control runs nodes unlike starkx decentralization angle storytelling
362295,could use substrate run orderbook offchain workers 
362296,yes course hermez similar starkex offering atm well announced launch zkevm testnet july i'm keeping eye would like know dev tooling compares issue dydx starknet cairo hard build i'd like know situation different hermez

362455,must joke hasu
362456,
362457,nice thank
362458,guess understand nikolai bit lmao
362460,mstable discussion 2 yrs ago
362461,dai everything supposed stable uncensored store value wanted make better verge dai demise
362462,idk demise without jokes managers fucking weird shit
362463,didnt anyone clone single collateral dai model backup dont count rai
362464,lusd close enough tbh
362465,got repo link 
362466,trying jump convo could guys explain expanding number collateral maker threat need connect dots
362467,expanding number anything adding risks thats fine needs grow adding semi fake stables compete psm way get another ust run basically trying make curve makes much sense small brain adding rwa subjective issue commenting per se
362469,maybe ungovernance right answer stablecoin providers honestly impressed solidity liquity
362472,nothing subjective rwas ser they're voting invest us treasuries using fiatcoin collateral bad enough nail coffin intents purposes fiatcoin dishonest marketing
362473,realize usd stable implicitly pegged fiat either way
362474,oh please grasping straws excuse something clear cut
362475,fundamental concerned fiat going tits coin pegged definition got tits literally designed
362476,good thing concern
362477,even simpler hit guy's twitter scroll rts way mostly cz binance
362478,currencies variety pegs especially dollar mean need wrap 
362479,concern sticking collateral decentralized money bloody treasury bond thing
362480,actually investing collateral treasury eg would lead dai less 100% onchain collateralized
362481,treasury lol
362482,sold 500m fiatcoin collateral deciding treasury thingies buy
362483,people conflating things discussion argument made somehow 
362484,think people supposedly making conflation concerned
362485,tell
362486,i'm asking think
362487,probably comes various degrees decentralization concerns translate offchain way works onchain
362488,believe degrees decentralization usdtusdcbusdetc
362489,designed way controlled central parties
362490,exactly
362491,meant assume people oppose treasury bond thing different degrees concerns boil decentralization concerns
362492,instead asking ton leading questions could state position move
362493,much fun way
362494,position submitting lot assets suits supposed stay away advocating go raistyle keep dollar peg dont give money away imho
362496,clear money comes irrelevant
362497,given vote almost certainly going go think difference usdcusdtbusdetc dai 
362498,becomes complex open usdc risks truly time
362499, dai frozen dai still onchain overcollateralized
362500,
362501,i'll preface saying already questionable construct forced usdc surely ambiguities time
362502,either change result understand concerns dont
362503,might well buy diamond ico behind smart contract owned swiss ag
362504, dai still onchain overcollateralized time becomes entrenched practically literally usdc governance top
362505,question whether bonds treasury investment actually replace critical amount dai onchain collateral
362506,80% dai's overcollateral series assets frozen single click onchain overcollateralized money cex onchain overfully collateralized
362507,would dai collateralized anymore full 500m get lost
362508,could guide list blockchain based crowd funding projects know names 1 ampnet 2 labs group please suggest
362509,wait
362510,shock mate
362511,point collateralization rate collateral comes second one well truly irrelevant sure concerned collateral
362512,seem weird ser
362513,point make sense stack infinite amounts collateral agree maker maintain vast majority collateral liquid decentralized cypto assets keeps growing theres issue diversifying
362514,may decentralized stablecoin fiatcoin misdirection freeze button lies
362515,sorry making weird simple words company needs funding palm oil busniess malaysia banks delaying process loan approval
362516,amount usdc collateral bigger problem imho
362517,perfect trojan
362518,still remember people replying temporary said nigh unlikely ever get removed us treasuries lol wen commercial paper
362519,soooon 
362520,mean real problem many liquid non volatile assets space
362521,dai supposed nonvolatile asset
362522,yeah order must collateralized assets sufficiently liquidated shit hits fan sure whether btc eth serve function extreme conditions
362523,strange go trying create construct mechanism tames volatility seeking nonvolatile assets back supposed tamer
362524,fuck alex
362525,time ones withstood critical condition
362526,already we'd using things wrapper
362527,agree extrapolate every growing dai supply might
362528,frax ser basically see dai perfect pmf gonna use usdc avoid issue personal transfers lock risks usdc able freeze account dai cant real use case dai frax stables basically wrappers usdc
362529,mean virtue signal want complicated issue solution apparent
362530,meme liquity day irrelevant terms scale scales would run issues
362531,liquity exists
362532,slow
362533,lol
362534,came first ever growing dai supply ambition expanding beyond onchain censorship resistant collateral
362535,problem slow refuse settle adequate
362536,taking makers side principle dont think hard see theres real problem solved
362537,ironic considering behavior one underlying selling point algo stables trip attack
362538,matter overcollateralized censorship resistant stablecoin humans prodding tweaking parameters certainly solved pristine solution possibly get liquity believe mean believe liquity solved problem scalable stablecoin
362539,think people started thinking ahead thats ambition came would like assume maker people neither stupid acting bad faith least core
362540,mean liquity perfect solution ideology people choose good let maker experiment route
362541,reality maker realized there's scaling cap token collateralized singular asset that's sai dai problem think solve adding ever exotic collateral mix selling decentralized censorship resistant least freeze button underneath covers
362542,yeah whats alternative basically abandon whole thing let run
362543,decided run whole thing governance style result
362544, nikolai saying feel like ye
362545,end goal deploy immutable steady state solution could done ages ago
362546,problem maker experimenting let's honest know happening i've never really fan maker anyone active ccr probably remembers largely due impressively elaborate gubernance problem selling lie they're decentralized anything certainly defi's biggest decentralized stablecoin
362547,oppose think maker past 2 years one interesting things follow claim nonsense fully understand implications doubt theres much insight gained meanwhile keep calm use liquity
362548,
362549,gov stepped
362550,well there's definitely insight gained take different things understanding implications they're well answer makes pretty clear difference i'm less willing give benefit doubt
362551,let confusion see overcollateralized stablecoins inferior product consider liquity quintessential overcollateralized stablecoin mean think experimenting stablecoins stopped whatever
362552,asked differences similarities know kind answer fishing 
362553,tbf fishing excuses 
362554,think becomes real risk share onchain collateral drops beyond certain threshold
362555,realworld collateral still onchain overcollateralized turn dai usdc
362556,absolute worst case lose 500m best case tap something goes seriously wrong onchain side things plus generate yield
362557,
362558,dai basically becomes blackrockcontrolled asset
362559,yeah thats ideological argument practical pov matter given conditions met otherwise walk please dont see
362560,what's ideological
362561,practical pov talking seems wildly different ideas dai supposed decentralized censorship resistant stablecoin sort onchain investment fund via lowvolatility wrapping asset
362563,scale mini debate happening couple years governance politics outcome we're currently observing
362564,nice means win 
362565,cost sir cost
362566,conceding second well point
362567,kidding understand sides opposed shutting whole exploration additional collateral long become main collateral sense terms 100% redemption would needed liquidated

363201,they're ones entitled crying tg either moot point bring
363202,consider fact screenshot essentially paraphrase andre's comment raise money anyone community bullshit theory follows someone token best interest whatever increase value token nave guess partly fault defi community calling governance tokens people want govern trenches helping fight instead throne dictator simply shouting orders plebian developers need execute dont care protocol dont care would soon sell token longer think contributing enough standards wont try add value happy spending endless hours time asking updates explain detail thought processes endless back forth pointless menial topics governance community kill innovation development dont
363203,that's point get issue raise directly indirectly retail emotional responses people clearly fit make investment decision
363204,wrong
363205,preaching choir tbh project communities mostly filled degens moon dust mission people think investing crypto essentially sureshot lottery
363206,whether raise money retail outcome virtually identical
363207,consider andre also raising money retail context matter whether intially let join later exit liquidity
363208,that's dubious redefinition terms
363209,20% risk free apy i'm
363210,zhu
363211,honestly retail term make sense clueless investor
363212,raise money satoshi raised money randoms willingly bought btc chose run nodes floor raising money bought token dex thinking i'd get rich conversation absurd
363213,wish could say right unfortunately case people claw faces tiny bit power feel comfortable enough consistently bite heels money unfortunately amplifies problem
363214,oh euphemism 100%
363215,community users well token holders extent funders experimental innovative products balance community devs needed bad behaviour exists sides spectrum
363216,really want dive andre situation he's satoshi made quite bit money even constantly larping opposite
363217,chasm user token holder
363218,community devs entitled wana build distractions accountability justified dont take public money
363219,i'm claiming he's satoshi
363220,necessarily
363221,mean satoshi made lot money sell mean ain't rich
363222,idea making money takes away anything funny case point
363223,basic point create expectations kind profit potential let everyone participate opportunity going deal stuff can't handle keep private
363224,strawman ser
363225,want claim even 50% token holders dapp users
363226,mean make argument side can't handle risk volatility early stage projects buy
363227,reason people launch tokens want make money there's always upside creator intend take money general public deal
363228,yes fully agree
363229,almost sides people act predictable ways
363230,friction misplaced expectations
363231,without accurate data cant claim otherwise claiming token holders usually vested interest also users dapp user also translate buying vision dapp project
363232,yeah retail expect get rich devs expect retail behave informed rational way simply put
363233,arguing strawmen
363234,bull tokens go tokens good bear tokens go tokens bad things even need token anyways
363235,first define raising money retail absurd bought token dex expect get rich attacking something nobody arguing
363236,clarified meant get
363237,meaningless okay
363238,safe conclude wen numbah go devs dicks community entitled dicks numbah go devs heros community geniuses
363239,strange would count sufficient data
363240,save network tokens almost everyone user virtue needing pay gas fees claiming there's dapp mere token holders outnumber users least 51
363241,expect crypto different traditional finance gatekeeping invest project match expectation instead expecting people take responsibility buying reasonable imo instead telling devs use private funding
363242,expecting people behave like centuries always unreasonable crypto magically going fix greed gambling 
363243,claiming anything also trying get argument highlighting rational assumption token holders also users lot smart teams know exactly utilise tokens bootstrap user base
363244,mean worked bank upon time beyond irate customers sometimes shitty behaviours ever recall receiving end level nonsense say happen nowhere near level happens crypto i'm sure argument weight people demonstrated capable controlling weird whatever reason seems get pass crypto like haha that's crypto
363245,really valid point imo however harsh reality raising public money always come public accountability positive negative
363246,less anonymity less risk probably makes difference
363247,nobody arguing token holders can't get expect get rich sure insinuate anyone people arguing anyone get rich coincidentally retail comment matter noteworthy
363248,yes safe say expecting people change unreasonable accurate we're expecting people change there's expectation people behave civily already day day lives
363249,people generally dicks internet risk punched face non existent
363250,even decentralized financial system instead already working centuries point people need manage greed gambling point entering new system reasonable expectation make acquainted new rules instead expecting everything ultimately want greed gambling restricted others know manage
363251,um ahem maybe curse experience cannot agree rational cannot think single project true one
363252,tbh idea point i'm saying projects first let retail close muh toxicity failed due diligence get using excuse exit problem first since 2022
363253,even make sense face 
363257,uh clear that's wrt users vs mere token holders
363258,bear market digest 
363259,yes naive 3 weeks ago brought people saidinsinuated wrong included fwiw yes probably misunderstand what's talked
363260,man would literally come w new definitions go therapy
363261,chart feels arbitrary classification layers
363262,yeah terminology inconsistent much existing discourse
363263,lol cardano layer 0 basis chart seems skewed bunch different areas layer 23 specific eth
363264,certainly welcome taxonomy hierarchy blockchain stacks would helpful avoid conflicting existing usage
363265,different discussion deal toxic community members denying existence
363266,eg layer 0 community consensis layer 3 rollups rollups
363267,well layer 3 starkware invention industry wide term guess
363268,eh insinuating toxicity almost exclusively tethered price due able build worthwhile community questionable 
363269,i'll say i've said times consider coddling retail treating adult babies entitled riskfree profit devs naive enough think talk community save toxicity naive like said unless first happens naivety remain
363270,let's cut feel bad spamming room another iteration think disagree much new things say
363271,let's talk happy things
363272,lets go sleep

363380,lmao 
363381,tax payers pay
363383,europoors though bis international everyone might impacted
363384,yea bis big dont get wrong
363389,difference hft illegal activities tradfi drawn mev based course signals technically illegal even put tradfi case
363390,may see bitter think every daofunded builder agree cases building absolute retards wenboiz bottomofthebarrel persuasion literally anything enough least 10% times build space convinced full anon route way go build raises dox nothing something useful cool fuck one answer telegram chats discords nothing non builders talk
363391,build guys nah build cause like also make good money focus work positive driven contribute maybe dont fall noise sadness hard gotta filter
363392,nay good money yeah like problem filtering tg discord groups accessible everyone want keep opportunities rolling never know one behind next dumbass asking next wen filter sir
363393,read accept decide adhoc wanna cry move
363394,sex alcohol gambling sports wanna zone work
363395,dont public channels dont take retail money build hearts content
363396,thats dao specifically talking dao public pants open style
363397,kek point exactly cant openness without dealing accountability entitlement positive negative
363398,hard times support group frens u shitpost ups downs 
363399,mostly downs aka
363400,hence kingdom
363401, buy fucking nft
363403,oef
363404,easier said done builder things get rough many different levels fud cut deep devs impostor syndrome often best advice imo either build alone ignore everything like bruno said dont build alone builder manage community time
363405,coder find gardening healthy alternative building
363406,agreed spare time building dictionary chechen language also like hydroponic set ups growing things
363407,different kind bug killing hehe
363409,really fun good way break away behind screen least away people screen
363410,love said 'regulation' mean ccp surveillance state
363413,touch
363414,could specific mean illegal activities legality action traditional finance world dependent country's regulatory scheme eu mifid ii requires companies engaging hft store trading data 5 years way regulators may decide investigate think instances market manipulation us regulation nms requires trading data exchanges exchange venues like dark pools crosses count stored exchanges surveillance units report sec possible instances market manipulation
363415,invested teller nft loan project
363416,asked kyc escrow nfts loan
363417,want check indeed case
363418,also make good money true rather vividly remember people losing minds sushiwhatshisname dared
363419,imho specific case distressed situation
363420,raise andre
363421,thnx lot really web3 like notion obsidian roam gitbook im sure bunch useful nonetheless
363422,raise csw
363423,also another case general dont think daos issues paying contributors
363424,would even say opposite daos overpay continue overpay
363425,true
363426,sers need hire someone blz use treasury need smth built
363427,somehow suggesting builders space making enough money problems access capital
363428,compared
363429,compared irl people making goood money maybe touch af
363430,i'm saying bagholders love cry builders making money like detracts anything
363431,alas seemingly evergreen example
363432,referring illegal tweet mentioned previously europoors mev searchers 
363433,front running even illegal thought spoofing illegal frontrunning fine
363434,frontrunning based insider knowledge illegal time
363435,front running illegal acting insider info quite subjective there's evidence often judged case case intent magnitude damage done market taken considerstion
363436,oh yeah referring hft based front running
363437,front running illegal 999% cases
363438,guess insider info still based information asymmetry
363439,yeah thought spoofing illegal
363440,ah know client going sell big size sell front insider info illegal
363441,yeah depends whether way got information deemed fair basically
363442,unless publicly announced position predicted certain position taken
363443,orderflow robinhood
363444,matter legal definitions i'm purely talking us sec limited bandwidth choose ones go rules serve deterrents market participants selfpolice never know sec tail details overall workflow secs market surveillance unit chooses ones go omes sros reported referrals 
363445,basically means rampant punished someone gets absolutely caught public fashion
363446,push luck know 9 times 10 nobody fight
363447,let's jump conclusions practice many firms especially execution shops hfs try better selfpolicing stay good side sec amd sros edit quick disclaimer 2nd paragraph statement based personal observation given network take grain salt
363448,sec sros flag supicious activities push luck choose go ability reg nms allows sros see every market activity sro model works read section iia sec's surveillwnce approwch changing examples cases went edit initially served deterrent people making unjustified criticisms tradfi world alleged injustices editted include citations exists factual statements acknowledgement educated guesses
363449,here's crazy idea come reverse accreditation test ban everyone fails test dabbling crypto first question lose money okay
363450,ok getting couch legal lets please go back getting rekt fin
363451,quantitative comparison amount transactions processed flashbots eden network
363453,okeee that's totally fair think edit link citations necessary add disclaimers saying secs approach change time data points deduce terms reg nms data fields sip market centers keep firm level info info sec's financial crime department approach
363454,real alpha quantum theory proving part reality probabilistic completly missed step physics game cz
363455,step stable coin game
363456,throwing stones glass house ffs
363457,double slit experiment says
363458,spoofing illegal tradfi frontrunning illegal common
363460,yes frontrunning common common frontrunning see remains illegal front running done upon covert information im sure sort front running youre talking tbh ill leave since convo formally closed point
363461,frontrunning covert information afaik publicly available information mempool
363462,actually mev crypto based public information
363463,bera market ration
363464,yes transaction reordering dont know much gas person willing pay hence dont know transaction get picked na
363465,hi guys dexs besides curve trying provide deep onchain liquidity pegged value crypto assets
363466,nothing deep curve try smaller tvl dexs like saddle finance thats basically fork
363467,sound right miners choosing prioritize txs pay see fit block building works referring something else
363468,thanks know saddle want find another examples i'll try look forks
363469,yes core thats front running works
363470,solidly forks like velodrome op use stableswap curve well
363471,mevgeth miner receives arb trade decides execute instead including original transaction
363472,uniswap v3 used
363473,actually sure mevgeth checks
363474,platypus avax uses diff oracle based approach
363475,also solidly amm curve
363476,one i'd love see formal research
363477,frontrunning describing happening based public information
363478,transaction part public mempool watch increase gas theoretically using private transaction service
363479,solidly good idea poor execution vecrv positions liquid fnfts positive thing we've fantom liquiddriver spiritswap see active secondary picking steam allows anyone buying lqdr increase costbasis tokens locked means get dumped xlqdr unlocks years
363480,balancer focused primarily stable pools stablemath pools stetheth stable liquidity
363482,balancer stablepool based curve's stableswap
363483,yea 
363484,yes agree original front run happens public info however front runners bots catch transaction guys essentially playing poker guys bid highest gas get transaction ser individual
363485,that's sounds like different problem tangential frontrunning though mention intermittent period tx confirmed allows use public information also frontrun frontrunners inclined
363486,right
363487,anyone use otocoio similar platforms spin legal stuff project
363489,heard podcast ago looks like cool solution i'm curious legit real legal aspect
363490,kalidao im sure court would honour
363491,also curious legally legit forming entity may legally bind ways unknown changing legal environment
363492,definitely cool tho
363493,check thanks
363494,huh interesting reminds njalla legal entities
363495,
363496,aw hecc pretty cool wish knew months ago 
363497,weirdly needed read today
363498,shit hits fan sure best idea use also strawman used companies get rekt relation
363499,
363500,looks cool also announced integration opolis health care need check really work tho
363504,
363505,anyone got suggestions upcoming token lauches groups useful calendars

363533,
363534,oh wow fuck launched literally couple weeks ago regulators sent shitty email probably
363535,dont think lol
363536,great launch w ribbon well ser
363537,nice start seemed
363538,think fickle dev reg
363539,interesting thought worked quite time didnt even see launching shitcoin dump noobs
363542,bonus nft lobster holders understand case ghouls
363543,removed link cause dont nft gambling chat anyway
363545,tradfi move tbills u cant retail treasury doesnt trade w plebs billionaires u via certified blabla agencies take cut 3% u see gonna 2% best really likely less idk ofc depends ur net worth u negotiate fees
363546,anyone run get node yes what's major usecase
363548,care decentralisation run service dont want get rate limited provider low latency stuff like mev miner validator
363549,also vibes
363550,also calls like ethgetlogs available lot providers resource intensive use case requires might run node
363551,question lenders right default pay back depositors kind ie eth btc etc liquidate usd pay back usd
363552,also want get snapshot time answer costs run node
363553,silly report requires 3 tb going run 750 mb case 
363554,think still useful tbh never really know requirementsrecommendations made sometimes things work even far what's listed requirement
363555,fair
363556,still think done bad faith
363557, funny read icp
363558,know bitcoiners call bad faith lopp starts baseline assumption able run node easy enough anyone basic consumer hardware something common circles benchmarks least see simply seeing conforms
363559,seem remember puzzled eth though i'd check
363560,feel like kicking tires know eth massive storage requirements instructions say anyways found bsc one interesting time completed 20 something gb wonder
363561,worse performance requires higher hardware costs prices users able attain sovereign security model enabled running node intent pretty clear
363562,far reasonable 999999% bitcoin maxi figureheads
363563,fair still think m00t like running probabilistic model feasibility transactions fees sustaining bitcoin network mining rewards end least eth trying something acknowledges problem
363564,well go article see actually cares minimum viability run node
363565,would trivial expensive set baseline arbitrarily high fit even solana well answer different question
363566,project actually core value anyone participate without amassing hardware
363567,power equate gains
363568,may want try bitcoin whitepaper believe also mentioned ethereum's
363569,remember difference miningvalidating simply node network
363570,wanted write og btc values
363571,celo iirc seem remember trying make sure could run node phone
363572,helium ogs anyone even using running token inflation since start
363573,celo staking afaik still discrepancy
363574,validation bitcoin otherwise intractable problem participate consensus economies scale always tend towards centralisation work start wants solve ie one cpu vote using asymmetric aes encoding research shows probably pointless 5 years someone would come asic defeat
363575,maybe mina
363576,qortal know
363577,ones solid model equal participation network everyone
363578, solid tech built like fully onchain decentralized chat neat features
363579,running node running validator btc high bar entry mining node
363580,whats point running node werent definition og btc whitepaper
363581,seems pretty hand wavey lacks clear description consensus works
363582,wiki
363583,tech works dont focus much opticsmarketing
363584,buidl
363585,verify everything network access history mempool directly
363586,think someone like alchemyinfura doubt they're mining they're running lot nodes
363587,assuming block rewards per block fixed still leads towards centralisation farms eventually rewards running single validators dont cover costs
363588,mint get sponsored already existing member
363589,issue self sponsorship addressing right
363590,point qortal amass money though create decentralized internet
363591,p2p
363592,right host simple websites network concept proven work
363593,also rewards progressively lower time eventually voted network
363594,bigger problem need sponsored
363595,based screenshot stuff moving opposite direction decentralized
363596,yeah gives secret society vibe
363597,refferal system
363598,malicious people set hard mount sybil attack think meant mentioned selfsponsorship
363599,agree perfect though use qortal without sponsored sponsorship entitles minting rewards
363600,crosschaintradechat use websites without sponsorship
363601,anyway cool unknown model may valuable onceand hard regulations kick people love jungle aspect crypto
363602,sure that's different thing
363603,reminds steem could count number entities network 1 hand
363604,incredibly dumb question ctrlf google failed snapshotorg's business model public good regular good samitarian open source project
363605,what's gnosis safe biz model
363606,well shit hosting infra ie graphql plugin support main site etc open source community good must expensive found gitcoin donate gitcoin seems disabled
363607,raise money sure tho
363608,yeah disabled raised
363609,easy imagine
363610,snapshot charge projects hosting offchain votes snapshot near future
363611,first become indispensable used across every project start charging protocolsprojects users
363612,hope go publicexit token would become shitshow
363613,good website lists events contract apart etherscan
363614,
363615,
363616,feels like stripe
363617,wonder stripe dump crypto actually
363618,wait stripe dumps crypto
363619,oh mean product
363620,upon time supported payments bitcoin bear market months ago something since can't actually tell time since work crypto started supporting crypto payments
363621,they'll back number goes
363622,yeah polygon

363629,ive become complacent especially seeing windows specific targets
363630,course yes lot thing exploits 0days1day macos costs slightly
363631,macos freebsdlinux core cool interface
363632,
363633,
363634,
363635,nothing safe guys macos bulletproof system less popular massive attacks definitely direct attacks use guides 
363636,words chances getting massive attack less chances hacked someone sorry spend 510 thousand dollars prepare hack equal devices almost operating systems hackers also care economics profit cost confident take risk keep mind use qubes os graphene os
363637,difference seems mac viable attacks spoofing supply chain attacks embedding nasties inside apps legitimatepose legitimate
363638,run pretty locked system macos need tighten opsec little
363639,reasonably predict ranking gas fees they're willing pay gas fee bid info updated real time seems like there's enough data build model
363640,difference difference price preparation price different exploits including file gluing exploits delivery exploits always cost suggest go zerodium see prices general toolkit less assume macos secure based linux freebsd words know working capable
363641,related note understanding reasonably predict depth width order book closely related volume predictable price predictable anyone market making background confirm least speak i'm sure okay reveal

363685,4 real
363686,lol literally even know sam discussed eip1167 days back
363687,kind done way actually acheives productmarket fit defi radically different anything else done rely erc20s fixedmaturities rather utilizes 1155's fixedterms means rolling unlocks value future yield pricediscovery rather trying use amm approximate value positivetheta asset
363688,looks like
363689,primary demographic also quite different anything people done read medium understand we're treasury management possible approach problem 
363690,im sure vcs dying fund regardless futile mission
363692,cool rob definitely something even thought defi would say closest terms cefi instrument

363720,oh sure totally clean phone random new address test play curious works btw graphene ethereum integration
363722,thats os privacy graphene os mean
363725,reading bit came across segment one mitigate risk bitcoins stolen adversary quantum computer previous section explained p2pk reused p2pkh addresses vulnerable quantum attacks however p2pkh addresses never used spend bitcoins safe public keys yet public means transfer bitcoins new p2pkh address vulnerable quantum attack indeed true
363726,curious usecase btw uniswap v3 supports one sided liquidity exactly wanted take erc20 wraps erc721 representing position
363728,slosest thing resembles bit yearn crew made daap u nft erc20
363729,explain
363730,go ygift erc721 standard based nft functionalities hold erc20 tokens attach string messages giftt via events 
363731,wondering consensus validity statements pretty big statement make say 'transferring bitcoins new p2pkh address prevents quantum attack vulnerability'
363732,
363733,usecase fun ser
363734,can't exploit exist mentioned public key cannot retrieved address public key revealed moment owner wishes initiate transaction
363735,seriously i'm exploring what's possible what's artist interested crypto pov

363746,take bitcoin change name ticker block time slap shiba inu top et voila le doge born
363747,speaking quantum things explorationinfomaterials quantum computing blockchain beyond security rather theory development things would handle things like bridges etc
363748,pack guys drinking chat room well short version like seems 
363749,bridges ones
363750,astrology dogecoin
363751,mean bridges guess anything crypto might look like etc
363752,think ivangbi made
363753,would strange quite correct accuracy needed bridges quantum mechanisms give accuracy give speed types processes make mistakes also hah separate processes fix errors aggregate design produce errors high speed fixes hand yes another side probably im writing understand well fact consensus difficult say probably direct useful bridges similar mechanisms moment breeches probably removal isolation risk associated technical solution comfortable profitable low risks option park 12 billion dont want think corporate go yes theyre already coming pointed express indepth analysis bridge market colleagues back january users needed bridge market users nervous active actively using various routes turned accidentally little problem way users loyalty trust hah theory twisted louder direction say breeches quantum dick work hah yes case yes necessary important thing homeopathic quantum technologies sorry english dont another write quickly one
363754,well looks beautiful hah way like movies ordinary computer quantum suck certain number valves huge laser
363755,forgot
363756,yesterday
363757,actually spare pixel 3 lying around data test report back looks pretty suspicious tho still lmao spare phone dont mind

363822,75m loc issued alameda highly detailed terms dao clue voting anything love smart contracts lot weve bankruptcies 100s years fine itll take 24 years insane legal fees real winner law firms chosen represent creditors
363823,ser chestertons fence
363824,restructuring goes new entity formed alameda likely receives equity
363825,per currently proposed plan new equity distributed account holders alameda
363826,basically come waterfall payments there's anything left dealing admin expenses account holders secured creditors get something wiped fairly straightforward process given details contracts chapter 11 around ages

363886,one source described multiple rounds interviews sky mavis engineer offered job extremely generous compensation package 
363887,right means using hardware wallets multisig signers
363888,fake offer delivered form pdf document engineer downloaded allowing spyware infiltrate ronins systems hackers able attack take four nine validators ronin network leaving one validator short total control
363889,
363890,someone excel sheet used simulations behavior curve pool eg put avalue liquidity parameters play
363891,4 9 nodes one engineer access decentralization deserve
363892,aka 1 1
363893,bridge schemes dont work hardware wallets sign automatically order process funds like gnosis safes signers getting compromised
363894, shameless plug breakdown ronin
363895,thing really gets going there's still 11 validators last check
363896,still permissioned
363897, completely failed achieving stated goals relaunching bridge
363898,wanted 21 external validators seems like 4 external ones
363899,either block explorer function checked svanevik said nansen runs ronin validators they're listed
363900,either way much room improvement
363901,could engineer access vps accounts using run 4 validators
363902,either enough get direct access nodes enough info social engineering cloud providers

363929,layer2s blow im bearish eth short term long term im ultra bullish
363930,uniswap worried composability used nfts
363931,think dydx uni foundamentally different approach dydx doesnt really need composability uni v3 needs least composability least options future possibilities

364144,even weird put proper question
364145,sure still mean lending protocols allow inherent leverage like 3x usually max even less protocols aimed leverage first use case reason things appear usually 1 farming opportunities recycling capital farm euler farmers total loss afaik friend farmed 2 arbitraging peg borrow supply side inside protocol like aaves steth eth folded positions 3 maples case users went around design protocol used capital got lp back rewards see 1

364423,anyone know standard library contract protocols use linear vesting oz wallet vesting seem like appropriate solution transferring tokens different roles protocol design contract solution
364424,poorer people saved making money time accredited investors able get risky speculative investments common people could never handle like uber companies go public regular investors saved yet accredited investors safely supply holdings i'm worried next years eu personally proposed mica bill approved without consent public essentially crypto surveillance package
364425,sablier standard one aave team used
364426,
364427,
364428,always lol meatspace thing pdf numbers considered proof anything

364446,stupid question metamask
364447,metamask sucks use frame
364448,frame great never looked back
364449,find lot errors wrt injecting websites ux needs work sure fuck consensys metamask fantastic simple product
364450,wdym
364452,maybe metamask either logged installed
364453,hmm wierd
364454,different kudos wrote fe implementing brave specific logic altho giving confusing ux calling metamask
364456,would confusing name wallet actually using instead name wallet installed
364457,i'm sure literally asking ambient contextual web3 client hey call
364458,long switch statement catch different cases opt generic web wallet smth like
364459,i'm pretty sure function call returns name wallet
364460,given many sites see hey already frame installed maybe try metamask i'm stupid i'm pretty sure literally check potential wallet names may even existed code written come
364461,anybody know project uses something like manage multiple underlying tokens eg something like one tokeninterface would allow unwrapping multiple crv pool positions
364462,elon musk ends 44bn bid buy twitter 
364463,
364464,reason uniswap always poor experience something wrong swap button takes multiple clicks transaction pops takes long update button approving token every process takes long compared swapr sushi etc
364465,
364466,theverge twitter says going sue elon musk trying back deal
364467,seems like instant sell price prices offer bots willing pay
364468,howdy happy answer qs
364469,sad erc1155 support apparently
364470,think released soon according tweet
364471,yeah 1155 support yet adding another pool factory
364472,differences fungibility either ids 1 id means need rewrite bit codebase
364473,cool like idea
364474,congrats
364475,

364481,problem sushi lol changing browser helped
364482,seem work better new browserpc wondering could make experience better browser want use
364483,browser using
364484,chrome
364485,lot extensions generally find runs well incognito mm enabled that's culprit
364486,many would consider lot 
364488,rpc issue uniswap issue
364489,ask probably many one also potential security risk enable mm incognito try fixes know many either disable create new profile minimal extensions use defi
364496,
364500,donations bro
364501,static site hosting rather inexpensive
364503,lots money guarantee safety sometimes quite opposite aligning incentives users best interests feel free look around better options anyone knows trusts llamas 
364507,memes kingdom
364508,dont use convenience still debating security decentralisation lulz
364509,wallet allows following user controls keys allow user b use wallet user b sign transactions access keys
364510,least obvious access keys ie interface
364511,cant sign without key
364512,interface mention keys 5 different servers nah
364513,know theoretically could pull keys server
364514,
364515,maybe drink water slurp
364516,closest probably gnosis safe credit accounts operator certain transactions like withdraw trade makes hf 1 permitted
364517,basically goal make someone sybil attack everything 
364518,smooth brain automatization lazy
364519,likely late game
364520,narnia chads 100 coinlist accounts back 2019 already
364521,longer profitable try ready next platform moon shitcoins
364522,wasnt talking coinlist bot farms game
364523,vanity create 100 accounts make bridge stuff u already
364524,ur server u need tech savvy
364525,also late
364526,check billion bots arbitrum
364527,late late point always long tail stuff exploited profit besides good implementation delegating wallet control basically allows ppl participate anything behalf
364528,ps narnia toxic dumpster fire
364529,u r attempting ser lol
364530,anyway banteg used ds proxy stuff multiple wallets back basis cash times je publicly talked one server multiple signatures multisend eth gas fees harvest brr
364531,wouldnt make interacting web apps difficult
364532,use hsm hardware machines keys generated inside one extract admin control access machine user b send transactions sign
364533,u interact w contracts backend directly nothing frontend related
364534,cause
364535,send transactions sign
364536,approve though
364537,need control approve need build web service around
364538,exactly arguing case
364539,also fireblocks solution build lot policies shit expensive
364540,maybe jhedglin explain time
364541,pretty much host site like free
364542,good enough security cloudflare provided weakpoint
364545,
364546,llamapay vesting well 
364547,yeah bitgo hsm multisig fireblocksmpc qredompc key management solutions policies also pretty expensive depends trying control
364548,anyone tried tokenized property investing like lofty ai algorands network looks like interesting way invest apart hodling
364549,reaction
364550,cause algorand fugezi fugazi
364552,anyway yes realt propy stuff like mostly buying detroit stuff passive cashflow idk
364553,ah see i'm sure passive earning see sell anytime well ty anyway
364554,oh wait see mean thought buy sell properties profit see rentals
364555,message looks like standard shil u already tried x z chain people dont like dislikes deleting funny af honest opinion
364556,okay get

364671,really worst described exploit revest 30 minutes occurred incorrectly ill add told funds still risk trying shut system removed tweet posted another said taken funds still risk 10 minutes later hacker returned paused token transfers 70 seconds later would lost remaining funds back march context really havent even tried improve
364672,i've worked one aggeeable audit teams improve imagine much would lost sam czun
364673,heard best guys left form blocksec guys true pros showed recovery inform us another bug contracts hacker missed patched going live using audits ever since
364674,remember correctlysame thing happened multichain earlier year instead notifying multichain team privately peckshield field day calling twitter remember follow exploits happened shortly team could even fully address situation
364675,get report

364684,could misguided could possibly see someone thinking hey detect security flaws post social media anyone else maybe they'll impressed use service product good said might advice need go around pissing people listening part would course
364685,til thx 
364686,hmmm sort tangential anyone ever tried launch product bet volume return ranking different tradinginvestment firms ie oh fund x return fund year given fund x pmusing strategies ball park
364687,believe fall prediction market category known problem would liquidity
364688,hmmm causes liquidity issue exactly typically matter types products right niche events enough people care see interest solution really better sales
364689,core seems boil product design problem could try answer package format index like product people already know trade could invent new product that's easy understand people would trade ie kalshi pipe figure 1 2 liquidity issue becomes partnership marketing issue getting enough people trade make markets cost structure profitability issue well technical operational etc
364690,liquidity issue boils marketing issue ye enough counterparty predictability thereof index like product would provide liquidity 's bundle bets guess know kalshi pipe sure
364691,considering people funded things issue lot bigger mere marketing
364692,solve product design works practice cost issue course biggest challenge design that'd secret sauce thought someone must figured least design operational issues
364693,handful projects done way users
364694,users thing ephemeral people care predictions except handful niches illegal andor well regulated point either close shop like accept fate super niche rest
364695,issue counterparty buyer matching projects solve pooled liquidity lps wouldnt expose themselfs pool unknown risk kind chicken egg problem peer peer rfq otc derivatives could solve
364696,
364697,welp original question asking projects done wrt volume products investment return products

364776,real question defi world making friends regulators influencing
364777,lobby groups individuals post unusual number opinions getting attention policymakers crypto friendly researchers articulate core benefits tangible examples case study secenarios
364778,know 3 eu crypto lobby educating meps blockchain europe european crypto initiative l3x lexnode slow process original problem digiconomist blog data influenced every eu crypto law since eu answering crypto data unreliable data lack details pow carbon footprint instance
364779,last two years
364780,coe
364781,fact digiconomist dude influenced anyone outright pseudoscience says
364782,hmm eu make regulatory decisions us could done chairperson needs done group 5 commissioners etc sure works eu zone

364786,know specifics haun ventures vc founded katie haun background fairly relevant question 
364787,guy made much harm crypto anyone else studies used every institution
364788,laughable scam ive failed 1st year undergrads better scientific reasoning
364789,named john keynez ps5 network hopes gaming one regulators giving sound inputs havent met regulators lobbies game though
364790,heres best one letter congress requesting epa get involved crypto regulation two sources de vries guy like citing food blogger paper nature insane
364792,welp hit major key points modern politics cade industry nothing defend wondering new rhetoric would that'd move conversation away defending crypto environmentally damaging wealth gap etc
364793,tangibly industry shift conversation away environment disparities created blockchain something positive hopeful
364794,industry aware benefits tell general public regulators convince least influence enough key decision makers that'd score major wins

365019,speculation continue gated chat that's wrap fun
365020,well bsc primary utility bnb lower fees binance trading always felt like bsc tacked point decentralized utility bnb instead actually aiming create viable chain
365021,bsc still remains 2nd largest used chain crypto fyi whatever people think centralized shit
365022,pancakeswap 2nd used dapp crypto
365023,hum hypothesis stand behind yet also think theres competition uniswaps fees 03% binance maximum 01% spot
365024,yeah casino indeed popular people underestimate popularity especially africaasia
365025,yeah amms clobs serve different use cases technically speaking unless binance trying launch already competing product also idk use cases uniswap targeting anymore seems changed quite bit since v2

365266,apart concerns issue working yield cut yield capital efficient assuming smth like 10% apr yield rate x% say 10% underlying yield returns either btkntkn lps protocol means need 100m tvl sustained year get 1m real pol
365268,yeah i'm convinced numbers actually work especially consider low yield pol gonna take closer look sure though
365269,built graph slide discussion appropriate market capitalization goal disruptive tech crypto
365271,graph point 15% pretty easy achieve sure ur hoping prove literally horse race
365273,seem like ohm worse

365292,cz would bought got threat intel steth
365293,icymi new issue state defi lending newsletter covering latest news well defi lending markets 
365294,maybe stupid question decentralized defi protocol heavily relies centralized tokens
365295,intentional design comply sec decentralising hands dao controls everything
365296,non compliant sec stables
365297,welp y'all need talk crypto lawyers least invite one lobsterdao i'm sure they'll field day considering they're always looking clients
365298,sounds sorta legal really might useful 
365299,we're talking stables take look low tvl l1 see accounts rubberstamp governance props they're owned team team can't call project decentralised they're openly making decisions decentralisation theatre make seem like makes harder regulators call l1 token security
365300,met crypto lawyers summarized gist passes default regulatory body us would cftc instead sec unless chose regulated sec's regulatory offering series reg ad reg cf etc
365301,wow damn telegram trolled thought stable coin quote conversation
365304,centralized token
365307,feel like there's prob logging eth address ur wallet hw device
365308,imo standard delegate permissions hot wallet something
365309,lots programmable permissions smart contract wallets
365310,probably best let contractsapp layer figure rather protocol layer
365311,yeah sure protocol layer thing
365312,maybe like ens sort contract anyone register address sign limit number sigs day log sn something kill login sessions see revenue tho hard fund
365313,maybe try smth like 
365314,quick read get
365315,
365316,think thats saylor right keep changing ethereum every 2 months create complexity risk increases complexity thats want software company want money
365317,perhaps ignorance pretending insight one considers prodding real money people use managers opaque populace compared ethereum similar transparent
365318,drip feeding research tho
365319,lots crypto lawyers lurking think ivangbi mods get bit tired armchair lobster lawyers tend respond much best really plenty channels topics

365338,try unrekt
365340,usdt one example
365341,well contract tether ability time time reason pause token blacklist address delete balance blacklisted address heavily reliant usdt well evidently mercy tether whoever coerce
365342,mate know usdt works ahaha question different
365346,asked rhetoric question wasnt incorrect dunno answer expect get que pasa
365347,would thing decentralized really heavily reliant usdt see it'd fit certainly completely automated la liquityuniswap useful human management required decentralized
365349,correct say defi protocol decentralized especially high influx centralized stables right mean time lp blocked centrally issuer correct except dai maybe
365350,dont pervert coiners words said correct saying weird notnecessary remix
365352,also amber heards lawyer fucking rewrite essentially ask correct sir yes bloody correct literally 
365353,salty trying come conclusion
365354,mental gymnastics thats annoying lol also coffee yet bags rekt aaaa eat poop ser
365356,protocol decentralized still centralized assets collateral cases lending stables really per se though often risks bundled unified pool cases trading things protocol hold assets way users choose fully decentralized
365358,defi protocols heavily reliant fiatcoins dai one today mostly wrapped usdc similarly designed fiatcoins asset wrappers wbtc new treasury thingamajigs liquity however quintessential example one exactly 0 reliance fiatcoin uniswapv2 v3 others though i'm certainly curious would happen routing got frozen
365360,think whole point 3acs tweet rather lawyers tweet point 3 aka liquidators incompetent missed value could used pay creditors one thing sure lawyers quite good better chances theyll walk unscathed next scam
365361,really wonder considered neither v2 v3 reliance fiatcoins unlike say curve naught effectively shut welltargeted blacklisting
365365,lol course freewayfi scam theyre even shy mlm ponzi wp heavily pushed ct shitfluencers affiliate links waiting collapse

365440,
365442,outside crypto people react 1% changes cpi coming little bit higher quite bad
365443,mean saying 005% naturally lower volume comes volatility also needs 5x less volume apr could clarify please

365453,think network states 
365454,anyone chance read yet network states mean blog
365455,first chapter seems interesting like really breaks sentence paragraph 1000 words political science degree far comprehensible work political idealism i've come across try reading leviathan das kapital etc tell think though likely i'm contemporary get context update finish
365456,premise see problems existing states seceding sovereign territory network state i'm necessarily target demographic relatively content state functions
365457,especially many breakaway states eg south ossetia transinistria struggle much getting un recognition network state likely fair better indeed without military might go nowhere though balaji advocate state creation via war
365458,couch legal i'm sure either way interesting book go buy
365459,counter vatican gets part un vote certain things part crowd maybe network state could pull one
365460,nomads 
365461,travel without sharing rekt experience web3 im longer nomad sad

365463,hi founder web3 project yet launch building numbers 12 month forecast burn reference set pre seed funding target experienced founder willing one one meeting sharing tips tricks plausible figures experience
365464,first target least 18 months runaway carnage thats coming future depends product potential market current team etc btw pre seed bigger ecosystems grants programs etc non trivial obviously enough compare pre seed raise dms open discussion maybe also keep
365465,looks like private clubs memberships start ups popped end early 2010
365466,guys favorite crypto price websites looking alternative cryptowatch

365481,sounds like kyc without privacy actually may compliant
365482,wait civic still around isnt vinny back maxi
365483,longer ceo last saw shilling doge though maybe moved
365489,
365496,lol 
365500, cel customers recv yields
365501,hmm sly nod towards pulling solendjuno celsius
365502,guess u say close enough dont think right unless celcius customers return yield recv
365503,rightful owners storytelling emotional blackmail world change ownership celsius he's got emotions side
365504,funny thread
365505,people calling solend juno waffling iz ponzi therefore maybe justifyed ting
365506,even get crypto went poster child libertarianism anybody take ownership someone's tokens greater good
365508,money ser money
365509,
365510,still one would think would taboo subject nowadays seems like first option that's brought soon shit hits fan
365511,used taboo subject compromises insert excuse started happening little significant push back recreating fintech one compromise time 100% brockshane
365512,think right around time people started saying crypto insert feel good things nothing crypto decided use feel good things rationalize every shitty thing possible
365513,honestly dao randomly decide redistribute tokens atleast tanks would make palatable
365514,bullish dao back token military force
365515,panzer dao
365516,where's real inflation
365517,500% per cz
365518,they'd prob want report inflation high prob deter consumer spending much getting ready reality i'm looking bureau labor statistics site can't find raw data used calculate cpi aggregate data per category goods services
365519,ie last couple months ended paying 1012% expenses instead 78% figure cpi might buy heavily exposed right tail goods that's real inflation personally feel americans terrible finances they're looking figure gonna cpi figure sets expectations behave
365520,zimbabwe weimar germany
365521,read coindesk article seems like pay debt liquidate 100mil worth btc collateral put
365524,thought i'd share brief summary took place ocean protocol hope helps summarize what's going event made us put heads work harder looking forward us shipping veocean related updates
365525,cpi consumers feel usually slightly reported high cuz rational expectations
365528,think preferred report want people getting scared en masse reducing total spending that'd really catastrophic meant control expectations
365531,i'd generally stay away pessimistic talks like perception economy actually impacts real economy get selffulfilling prophecy situation pretty easily 
365532,inflation rate increase money supply relative economic output saying cpi correct metrics measure what's happening definition 500% inflation right assumption
365560,talking mmt let's talk cpi mean crypto defi world
365563,currency meant unit account society easily exchange goods services examined another point view currency unit represents fashion parts economy accounted within unit bitcoin never youd need sort basket representing many goods possible hyperscaled economy might closely resemble energy bitcoin time moves forward lose relevance outcompeted things accurately represent unit economy measuring anything btc kind odd btc moves sometimes 5% per day supply money increasing decreasing wont bad good thing forever see time currency increasing supply shows total sum value economy increasing
365564,welp cpi something focus fact supply gone x impact focus mere supply increase supply demand focusing supply something btc mmt naisu
365566,suggesting exactly
365569,data back curious see much debt
365570,projects working solution fiat problem
365571,groups pretty levied look like good positions
365572,whats problem
365574,problem part cycle ray dalio outlined video helped understand alot 
365576,think technology exist prolific within 10 years allow currencies looked different way perhaps usd still around currency redeemable hard assets going big leap forward
365577,currency represents units economy bundled together weighted appropriately dont really need sort cycle switch components
365578, pretty interesting 
365579,watching
365580,im sure would work currencies value governments defend ik bullcase btc would make top countries power use currency
365582,well dont need use create say platform
365584,one going use btc failure
365586,best thing find one uses try build better productcurrency
365587,btc successful conditions use transactions
365588,thats pretty bad statement considering one uses already
365590,yes normal people
365591,would consider normal
365592,triggered beyond belief
365593,projects claim able use zero knowledge swaps use multi party computation facilitators help btc become viable mechanism payments due increased privacy
365594,ill give guys hint composable system economic good services etc going exist soon rails distribute new tokens created platform already exist cant tell ill called shill im super excited future currencies
365595,yet hold btc greater 0 time expose volatility
365596,uh thanks
365597,welp that's certainly opinion interest rate hike triggered markets falling caused precise typically people start scrutinize valuations interest rate goes
365599,bro prove point something 20xed want people willingly give buy coffee make car payments
365603,mr stands something think
365604,prevents people using payment system
365606,lack privacy confirmation time cost vendors willing accept
365607,among things
365611,engineer price btc stable building top instability questionable
365614,raising interest rates way reduce demand finished goods services automobiles appliances world economy growing rapidly believe raising interest rates prove sustainable problem inadequate supply finished goods services due broken supply lines low wages workers raising interest rates wrong course action cause even fewer automobiles appliances made cause many current workers laid approach world trying deal workers tend make situation worse rather better solution lower interest rates stimulus checks higher inflation
365616,loss confidence fiat
365618,got around writing quick tldr anyone's still interested quite lossless lottery reflexive leveraged yield token mechanism amount leverage accumulate depends many new participants come bit complicated cuz btoken accrual mechanism weird i'm pretty sure got jist 
365620,holy crap yeah im going bed mr reign tonight
365621,hmmm privacy cost issues technically lightning network solves time issue right vendors issue sth non business entity well capitalized entity worry purely focus building part take time btc maxi trying understand learn
365622,referring btc general lightning
365623,hmm yeah maybe that's confusion i'm talking underlying transaction payments infrastructure coin
365624,completely irrelevant compared volatility
365625,mpc protocol referred built top lightning cost transaction finality would mitigated
365626,john doe care privacy gladly get chipped order able pay wink
365627,time adoption utility solve assuming adoption takes place
365628,time going thing favors
365629,certainly interesting see maxis stick 21m storytelling reality increasing insecurity longer trivial ignore
365631,wen bear opt raise lower val even means round ideally runway extending beyond 24 months whatever expectation bear integrate cost cuts scenarios
365632,btc figures economic sustainability issues better fiat slow ustlike softrug like mentioned
365634,see attempts within btc community even acknowledge issue discuss
365649,mrkwhg keeps fucking macro battles 100 messages advocating fall world etc permaban person didnt listen multiple warnings literally 3
365650,accident deleted msgs oops well time literal flood blabla
365651,coiner dont gaslight randoms
365652,transnistria breakaway state like catalunia example fabrication russian foreign politic meant strategically serve interests power holding region

365672,alliance dao first raised 50m printing shitcoins prepreseed rounds model
365675,worth scrolling projects though
365676,hilarious accepted lending protocols exchanges even nft wallet decided pass humanode without explanation half year ago seems like guys imagination see list becoming multibillion protocols
365677,general negative view tokenized incubators web3 startups
365679,imho usually netnegative incubator crypto vs hackathons gitcoin things simply open community day 0
365680,unless founding team literally 0 experience crypto need hand holding
365681,dont weeks spend chats see happening
365682,case wtf u kids get ur hands dirty first
365683,actually like techstars accelerators go alliance even give x total token supply talk go demo day go away mention tc
365684,oh freeride whats gain ur logo
365685,think web3 traditional value connections get taking part sometimes useless programs rather trying fight donations gitcoin raise money create hype
365686,sometimes invest founder let wont insist
365687,unless weird web2 startup usually u go outlier ventures huge sum 510% lot stuff afaik least used would never even call startups crypto defi related mostly weird choices small slow eu teams
365688,ye crypto open spend bit time get niche audience
365689,memes pron gifs research etc tradfi seems harder
365690,given community investors actually
365691,include pron gifs marketing strategy

366036,possible mix nft since they're non fungible definition
366037,imagine
366038,nft stands nonfungible token words unique
366039,possible build zeroknowledge nfts could wrap existing nft zknft that's whole rabbit hole
366040,wondering one send nfts doxxed address different safe address
366041,get hacked
366042,there's also accidentally selling cheap totallynotmyaccount
366043,bring good point though aside ahem losing hardware wallet nfts boating accident mix well privacy
366044,hahaha opensea seems problem bought nft juicy floor new owner idea stolen put sale original owner reports stolen new owner stuck nft flagged rekt scammers likely havent found way mix nfts owing non fungability nature may continue issue os
366045,transferred such mixed nft another wallet second wallet still doxxed nft mixing would work sort fungible like 1000 nfts
366046,aztec connect might near future 
366047,unique nft goes one address comes another address owner even kinda need visibly sell lie
366048,selling buying back nftx sudo pool give plausible deniability
366049,well nft still flagged
366050,tornado definition work tokens fungible got answer nft acronym
366051,long til exchanges freeze deposits coming wallets interacted tornado cash

366061,nfts network longer
366062,traction kind nfts pretty sure ppl want privacy around general nfts specific implementation separate chain could wrong
366063,yes we've millions volume hundreds collections key use case seen emerging around freetomint use case reputational identity gated access also many bridges emerging we're ibc chain also looking crosschain contract calls
366064,there's already multiple nft chains beyond eth trend slowing

366075,private secret network validators simply outsiders looking
366076,validators can't read data enclaves private everyone except person interacting w contract
366079,although i'm fan firm's investment strategy pretty good job lp i'd trust founder maybe much
366080,seriousness research different types vcs much capital strategy deploys shapes coming industries like defi economicindustry research similar topics
366082,ie like long term value investing macro investors ratio wrt amount capital deployed impact new industries like crypto internet industry 19902010s electricity industry 1800s etc lessons could carried public markets ton data
366083,crypto sector a16z
366086,less cynical empirical
366087,interestingly enough blacklisted hop sybil address dispersed eth attempt get addy's blacklisted 
366088,vc antithesis defi like celcius blockfi antithesis defi clue name
366089,original bitcoin project needed vcs decentralization need central entities extent whoever determines goes decentralization
366090,sure empiricism nature holds water money going keep flowing a16z friends nudge crypto worse copypasta stock market guise helping value investor rly care storytelling anything get money less competition way
366091,get point let's try strictly look use cases underlying technology businesses built top arpanet internet take business become thing use cases internet hand
366092,expecting oh public markets macro ride wave money circulating around makes rise fall markets even worse according papers xyz here's plays private markets papers abc suggests that'd play ways brand new industries
366093,think bitcoin new internet certainly best form money far blockchains think obviously potential replacing old parts financeadministrative institutions required trust
366094,people care number go alarmingly tons new devs
366095,obviously study economy see interested money making paperresearch making powell recently said know much inflation works tell everything academics economy science works
366096,think we're 2 separate convos i'm sorry ever asked tis wrong place discussions
366097,account spread flat lies nexo saying
366099,baseless fud letter even well written full mistakes lets move
366101,
366102,collateralised loans like crypto's communism always fail people claim true form never tried
366103,defi machinelearning based credit score pick one
366104,guys fast reader yikes
366105,never replace traditional lending
366106,yes
366107,can't together
366108,one inherently centralized
366109,oh mean lending decision centralised well yeah
366110,that's okay let's call elephant turtle
366111,undercollateralized loans
366112,reputation multi round game cost quitting game zero incentive repay can't work around
366113,
366114,3ac
366116,lol true like said much hopes wanna see goes
366117,ofc want build like billions dollars loans failing
366118,small experiment size fine 
366119,basically saying concept credit broken
366120,exactly
366121,really 0 maybe dont factor opportunity costetc
366122,people like 3ac love adrenaline
366123,umm that's something else tho right giving collateral lol
366124,gave collateral blockfi
366125,credit consequences default
366126,nope youre general concept credit good risk inherent can't completely eradicated defi eradicates overcollateralized kind defeats purpose begin
366127,sers lets beat around bush much already reiterated point make good
366128,thanks saving ass 
366129,anyone know lock ftx yubi enabling 5% yield app still get yield
366130,get perfect credit wait till 10 reputation based lenders lenders wait till addresses years mileage customers
366136,anyone know protocols masterchef v2 still v1
366137,cant cost quitting game access game
366138,going enforce
366139,enforce access
366140,access back
366141,well get access back
366142,youre staked upon reputation
366143,stakers youre beginning ladder
366144,presumably penalising terms interest
366146,sad reputation reset
366147,imaging cheap buy good reputation middle bear market
366148,ah interesting buying reputation
366149,stakers would slashed
366150,oh noes stakerz
366151,principle would minimum cost scale repeating trade
366152,saying wouldnt profitable grand scale
366153,like credit card defaults
366154,profitable
366155,paying back credit card profitable
366156,enjoy purchases
366157,like jet ski paddling pool watch
366158,nothing like credit cards
366159,credit card defaults prevent person getting future credit cards 23 credit card providers cross checks work address defi
366160,exploratory conversation
366161,riffing
366162,yeah theres comparison
366163,banning essentially alphanumeric gibberish using contract nothing return money lost prevent getting new account
366164,new account requires staking
366165,one implementation means coordinate pull
366166,address defaults gets blacklisted across defi already highly unlikely since protocol blacklist reason someone decided give undercollateralized loan go cex new address build good credit give nice bonus year
366167,yes think blanket fresh accounts history interaction start horrendously low base
366168,requirement ye dont think undercollaterised reputation trust
366169,think outsource trust scalable model
366170,imagine lengths people go game airdrops dont see reason would put less effort game uncollateralised loans
366171,upside access global credit top must valuable enough best allocators credit capital offset losses initial scammers defaulters gaming access system
366172,well need look 3ac see looks like
366173,upside capped since alternative using overcollateralized loan
366174,isolated system blacklist others follow suit like score
366175,hmmmmmm
366176,everyone follow suit chain credit rating agency centralised decentralised
366177,yeh im completely reinventing wheel think perhaps peer peer attestation ownership could thing
366178,many people cant prove assets
366179,see using score calibrate personal collateral ratio good returning customer get 115% fresh address 150%
366180,physical assets cant onboarded onto crypto without solving oracle problem
366181,yeh sure
366184,legal framework accommodate chain assets
366185,yep enforceability piece
366186,beginning everyone friendly nice repay debt time well world every repayment system trusts progressively credit maybe even survive bear market one day vanishes left missing 10b point announce banned account
366187,yeah
366188,could happen
366189,real world equivalent depending got money nice men 5 wrench would come visiting ask search couch change spare nice men nice men exactly anything hold onto smart contracts
366190,youre point requiring credit men wrenches indeed youll tell wallet address stake indeed theyll break legs
366191,perhaps send one hope something
366192,expect major usage credit traceable blockchain btw wont bilateral attestations banks crypto lenders struggled
366193,make affordance decentralization solution pretty trivial we've since interestingly named salt days 2017
366194,well trivial regulated lending business
366195,would say core protective tenants regulation
366196,regulators decide accurately would demonstrate current rules whatever may apply
366197,core requirement regardless spun centralization somebody needs able knock door event however unlikely bottom falls whether nice 5 wrench nice set documents
366198, lawyers group odds team gets held accountable long timeline case like
366199,remember alameda ftx announced investment put radar stayed away vibes discord backed republic galaxy digital alameda research ngc coinfund kraken curious dumper
366200,thread said investors saft0 dumped
366201,saft0 means preseed right
366202,according thread leftover tokens public sale sold via otc
366203,anyone else feel cz active twitter nowadays
366204,thanks clarifying problematic allocation never disclosed anyone knows could family member
366206,decides thing especially 
366207, fyi lobs
366208,put 15k one ring seed round never claimed anything something available
366209,notsofast retweeted past 8 months billionaire exchange owner threatening harassing giving domain ive owned since 2017 binance's cz arguably largest proponent decentralization resorted centralized means order steal domain 
366210,domain 
366211,lol know might scammer posing binance
366212,possible doubt thread pretty detailed
366213,overlook something certain tweet i'll leave adventurous eyes notice
366215,rs og btc 2012 aint going without fight 
366216,guess second round 5k
366217,
366219,good fake im pretty sure
366220,
366221,best take chance
366222,luna good
366224,dont think would process buying distressed companies insolvent
366230,binanceca domain seems like domain squatter
366231,lobsters im participating solana hacker house uxui important math question combination 3 elements generation image nft target 5k nft max user many properties require found use factorials way definitely suck math
366232,3 different types element like hat shoe socks want total 5k combinations
366233,would want 17 18 since 17 cubed 4900
366234,change one element 20 hats 15 shoes smth variety one
366235,yeah three numbers whose product around 5000
366236,hum thats bit problematic think adding types elements actually background img background color logo fixed doesnt count proprety id guess pattern
366237,want users dont create 35 properties
366238,thank guys way truly appreciate
366239,really complicates idea xx
366240,user opportunity create nfts 345 properties 
366241,yolo
366242,wanted make users able generate 5k nfts 3 images seeing responses idea would know many total attributes users need starting input lets say user wants mint 1k nfts formula give amount elements needed total well simply divide 3 wed solving two problems way first well require proprieties users want mint 5 10 15 nfts lastly well enable users mint 5k nfts theyre able provide enough elements
366243,understood well reasoning would solveinput x3 
366244,domain squatting illegal
366245,main thing keep types proprieties low possible 3 would ideal 4 would ok 5 would probably limit would make building pretty bothering users event tag generator building
366246,net nfts cases 5k assuming nfts minted 345 properties equal ie 1666 defining properties sample space becomes 16660333 1666025 166602
366247,166602 meaning case 5 total propoertiesyou property variations around 45
366248,oh understood well would proprety userinput13 
366249,would optimal expect users probably mint 1k
366250,also let users input much x z want enter property compute resulting number nfts minted xyz
366251,oh think also go something simple problem develop users know total nfts first knowing x z event tags itll based number people attend event serve basis know many elements youd need
366252,overall clearer idea proceed guys additional feedback let know wanted thank much helping first irl hackaton want make newly met teammates proud working
366253,
366254,owned domain rights
366255,might win case idea canadian law says squatting says registered domain bisexual girlfriend nance hilarious could work us he'd lose pretty quickly
366256,likely facetious yes he's probably going lose ironic situation considering cz friends probably spent much farce already
366258,real goes different school
366259,yo lobsters anyone using used crypto market data api like coingecko cmc cryptocompare others i'm conducting research hoping learn api use case user experience please dm chat 
366260,
366261,wen ens suit
366262,using hodlersh app cmc really good expensive also policy grow 100k mau disconnect cryptocompare became paid point switched coingecko good stable free right limits
366263,hey trying hodler app last month shared team love simple sleek ui ah thanks info coingecko rocks ps work cg always open hear feedback anyone improve cg products api happy learndiscuss users even used competing siteapp that's keep us innovating better grow industry together 
366264,we've done dozen times made elements tradable collections oldie goldie 
366265,anyone got link something shared recently allowing check token balance address time
366266,thank sharing im sure understand similar website people upload proprieties elements 
366267,actually read article im sure understand shared sorry 
366268,oh need website that's already done static parts something like web ui hashlips
366269,noo need make website 1 two parts dapp developing hh paris
366270,get
366271,depends domain literally binancesomething he's wrong
366272,general bro i'm gonna build app stuff weird looks like he's trying squad domain clearly violates registered trademark matter whether domain registered first afaik
366273,ah yes apparently binanceca guy dumbass believing basis keeping
366274,ok couch lawyers case closed
366276,mean register com domain automatically get rights appropriate extensions people registered well
366277,works
366278,thats works registering trademark domain jurisdictionally dependent stuff talking generalized way upset ivan 
366279,hey friends recently wrote experience using discordjs noble check 
366280,lobster daily 472 daily recap 14 july 1 lobsters ethcc paris link discussion 2 samurai knight yankee arthur hayes read link discussion 3 guide collateralized stablecoin landscape link link discussion 4 a16z top 10 crypto villains spray pray shit projects link discussion 5 mixer usage reaches alltime highs 2022 nation state actors cybercriminals contributing significant volume read link discussion link discussion 6 reputation multi round game link discussion
366281,also rainbowkit really nice library web3auth
366282,hey guys im currently building decentralised platform help emerging crypto experts validate expertise thus increase following reputation platform enable people make predictions various crypto events chosen users correct predictions could tokenised displayed web3 web2 social media platforms please dm find idea useful interesting
366283,tokenised fact
366284,pure vanity utility
366285,cover image vibe
366286,tokenise expertise verified terms utility vanity integrating tokens ie quantified expertise existing ecosystem tokens nontransferable represent fair evaluation one's knowledge crypto
366288,degenscore extra steps
366289,understand question correctly asking platform would different degenscore right propose framework evaluating expertise fairly using prediction markets created users expert score depend popularity complexity events predicted correctness predictions
366290,experts usually simply netting 51% wrong bets 100%
366292,sure understand question asking still expert without 100% correct track record
366293,amazing lmao
366294,lol
366295,uniqueness japan
366296,
366297,opinion guys
366298,looks interesting
366302,basically trading others putting money trade
366303,many complex terms
366304,social trading cool idea many different ways implemented attempted back days onchain fund even one banteg things like set protocol way reason neither implementations ever caught tam could influencers rake cash scam posts moon soon weird
366305,dhedge enzyme social trading
366306,interesting yeah ideally work guess think issue need part every trade trader net profitable size ratio entering one trade would lead huge gains losses right
366307,single trade might serve purpose
366308,yes work
366309,ye need trades past acitivty never future performance
366310,actually trying solve plus adding fun level solution least see build several levels layers
366311,that's true
366312,every trader cycles
366313,successful period must come destructive one
366314,well that's true still better chance single trade
366315,may share topic first iterationlayer 
366316,platform identifies relative expertise get expert tokens correctly predict outcome difficult market difficulty context determined among things number incorrect predictions said market
366317,there's several problems social trading basically 1 they're consistently profitable traders worth following 2 one actually appears strategy gets crowded seizes profitable 3 strategy public people simply copy without going social trading platform
366318,yes three correct
366319,wish harmony cared improving tech seems focusing things even matter see q3 focus 
366320,add social trading scalable social trading platform usuals expect developer build end end development pipeline fetching data feature engineering feature evaulation testing strategy building risk management cases simpler profitable trades well long tailed cannot manage much capital strategies
366321,foundation falling apart inside
366322,think original harmony difficult position
366323,yea harmony always late wrong everything stumble without welldefined plan sharding already bit old fashioned large part team left project
366324,successful traders platforms get cut profits others make copying trades right effectively way successful traders hedge fund without one get deploy capital strategies get cut profits
366325,definition successful traders successful dont share trades right
366326,ignoring fixing apis rpc security repegging bridged assets etc focus minting nfts adding fiat onramp think possible become ghost chain
366327,necessarily cfe burry's short tesla big trades rewarded talking book people jump trade benefit
366328,apply copy trading retail platforms course mostly scam facilitate customer trading thus commissions often times profit brokerdealer cos trade customer
366329,
366330,trademark
366331,clearly gonna stop
366332,well high certainty trade signal really wouldnt incentive share would expect marke information get incorporated market prices regardless telling everyone however theres incentive share pseudo trade signals youre motivation get folks ape turn trade signal self fulfilling prophecy
366333,think l one traders followed public creates great security concerns sometimes share strategies profit honest l wont use gcrs short list make anons make couple thousands trading journey turn selfish long profitness increase get afraid strategies copied stolen
366334,crypto right enough liq even top traders add funds without enough volume wise risk management
366335,real question add size dox alpha chain analytics firms plying sophisticated analysis anyone size anyone good strats getting rekt nansen
366336,real problem ecosystem shelf life creative alpha short defi
366337,maybe mechanism preventing liquidation hunt 
366338,usually trade binance people l know minority trades ftx except bull market barely trade defi use nansen especially execute strategies essential
366339,yeah come trade strat subscription service alpha 
366340,that's tricky wonder much liquidation hunting based know fund xyz size size
366341,dont believe alpha every trade another independent battle gurantee work always
366342,there's great debate right there's importance getting people bandwagon want get way getting onchain analytics makes tough heavily tracked folks buy position
366343,maybe wanna shop otc order flow need unload big block need world see idk think way onchain analytics work bit perversion price discovery
366344,like battle hard element privacy also buy alpha there's people lead market ie renaissance technologies alpha shop long ass time tradfi nansen thing back day would dudes made gains think
366345,even alpha trade secrets right charge mgmt performance fee people copy trade everything
366348,3ac leaded market lts ok long lead push price alone 69k without support problem start market leads
366356,yeah renaissance consistently bringing 66% annualised returns 30 years basically done incredible job leaking info outsiders
366363,exactly 100% key privacy protects gains stance self adjudication others see mission critical adversarial markets
366382,one point note though privacy oftentimes used synonymously intransparency privacy enhanced tech blockchains adopting showing us seems common misconception also led lot larger corporates jump bandwagon aping idea private blockchains thinking privacy established reintroducing opaque closed systems
366416,lemme post something interesting peace 
366417,think fair point things need transparent things ie smart contract verify looking looking code see going operate expect critical mean balance public participate crypto markets
366418,exactly spot transparent systems respecting user privacy isnt mutually exclusive fact complementary imo one biggest opportunities web3
366419,profitable trader would even go hassle participating social trading first place important question solved imo
366420,expect fait finances swipe debit card want vendor bob's soda shop know we're swiping card enough pay soda however bob need know much money bank account total much i've spent past able follow future forever long use debit card idk got far crypto path wallet side privacy suppose work stuff product fit brainer really 
366421,reason correct
366422,regarding alpha i've observed quite time interesting phenomenon logical think publishing alpha calls several times incoming dumps market mix onchain social data analytics yet almost one seemed care much even went angry market crashed analyses get appreciation bought subscriptions well yet real alpha leave market seems somewhat little discussed even addressed participatants keep looking alpha understanding buy imo totally wrong interesting human psychology
366423,feel people new crypto understand gain knowing leave enter
366424,yes that's obviously case
366425,like 20152017
366426,still wonder though first 6 months crypto enough get important namely exiting market rather partially rebalancing stables rest secondary
366427,believe people learn actually adjust talk much especially talks appreciated say least market pumps
366428,agree personal analysis newcomers see crypto assets like stock investment even worse lottery higher % success want learn want flip without knowledge alpha groups seem best solution many people seen understanding word basic cg page 
366429,human psychology win thanks lose market
366430,true manipulation 'terrible alameda lol
366431,never stupid
366432,exactly never learn philosophy imo
366439,chit chats lobsterdao kingdom anything proper content permamuted
366441,king ivan
366442,amazing see finally becoming mainstream thought instead fringe thinking
366443,permissionless privacyfirst accept substitute
366444,introducing revolutionary pay2chat model
366445,absolutely also defi think potential real gamechanger bring forward new financial market infrastructure tradfi simply wont able keep
366447,
366449,thanks posting great article
366451,interesting wondering anyone would put effort create something like feels almost like whoever wrote script video lost lot ust trying make persiflage founder cultism ironically may fallen wondering whether people upset kwon maybe upset long stuff like helps people find peace mind
366452,maybe wanted make something thought would funny none assuming ever crossed mind
366453,yeah probably youre right
366458,ivan still stables
366460,hello anyone know crypto wallet address paypal robin hood webull
366463,hey fwb discord worth think year ago social daos token gated communities hot thing feeling right
366476,pumping questions got permban gm spammers
366477,looking least 5000 people signed become early settlers
366478,a16z investment best exit liquidity 
366479,defi alliance right 
366480,
366481,impressive users churning though
366482,guess people always wanna gamble tho
366483,30x leverage
366484,much higher perps
366485,arguing point though
366486,churning due losses liquidations 
366487, new money enters time fair
366488,people hedge funding rates better platforms general hedges
366489,also kyced perp platform well
366490,interesting oxmikko apeir99n 
366491, info hedging
366492,
366496,slowmist hackers implement phishing attacks implanting malicious js files premintxyz website deceiving users sign transactions setapprovalforalladdressbool thereby stealing users' nfts assets
366498,
366499,doubt looks different centralized derivatives exchanges tbh gmx makes casino pl transparent first time 
366501,well secret traders lose money kek
366503,public platforms stupid
366504,whales using liquidity wish
366505,muh transparency
366506,get point really
366507,everything easily trackable literally build tools analyzing public participation
366508,trades dont settle differently gmx whales see would retard system manipulation happening means people gambling anywhere else whats problem w transparency
366509,ok sure
366510,
366511,yup public elsewhere see
366515,daos quite treasuries need work spend grow ways lack outside participation grants program whatnot would propose get paid asking friend
366516,btw genie looksrare gem opensea etc xmons
366517,pretty sure wip well
366518,
366519,hum sure taking time
366521,anyone accesscontrolsol l33t wanna add contract questions pls dm 
366522,understand canto he's layer 1 developers even validators running
366523,weird experiment
366524,worth degen
366525,info convos thread interesting indeed discussed dont see purpose apart truly experiment bro
366526,u r free discuss kingdom dont trading investments
366527,3 contributions github 
366528,tried running validator sir
366529,
366530,link ze info
366531,
366532,whats costing 47m
366533,might need go mckenzie org structure
366534,think ready mainnet 20th tried project fast suspect security
366535,exact info next message mckenzie like corp structure
366536, noice lobsters thoughts use casees
366537,hey guys know read details modern vamm implementation details polysynth dynamic curve
366538,docs source code
366539,pretty great docs bit aside edge cases using safemath sol 080 use sure necessary 
366541,hey guys question finalize direction team let building frontier tech project wiser deploy eth one major l1 especially transaction fees fundraising problems merge lower transaction fees easier fundraise eth
366542,merge nothing tx fees fundraising
366543,u building defi project compostable major protocols supposed used whales ethereum choice u building retail oriented dapps defi gamefi nfts etc choose evm chains l2s focus user cases fundraising
366545,wont txt fees lower merge
366546,
366547,merge effectively swapping consensus mechanism
366548,building something new fear deploy layer1 someone steal idea copycat eth network l fundraise eth
366549,direct effect txfees
366550,would different deployed alt l1 like polygon avalanche
366551,get information happen exactly merge like exact moment happens eventual side effects etc
366552,
366553,userbase eth much higher risky bet us deploy brand new idea like uniswap opensea somewhere else eth
366554,yea whole process supposed seemless end user right like actual transition require anything specific
366555,nothing dapp devs
366556,always copy cats idea good focus rather worry others
366557,whats ur fav solidity editor used like webstore free trial wondering there's anything good hate vscode cuz made devil
366558,vscode
366559,uh originally bc genie friendliest linking schema apparently gem also supports address suffix would preferred lr os bc show everything
366560,webstorm jetbrains solidity plugin
366561,yep thought happens case failure though what's emergency plan rollback chain whatever 
366563,sort failure mode mind
366564,fork fails chain stop usable bit like something real spicy
366565,imo visual studio pretty cool also lot nice plugins like solidity visual auditor consensys
366566,rather soul intact 
366567,shrug wait chain start finalizing
366568,yeah sure accidentally choose wrong ide code start smell might end hell better safe sorry one
366569,might die everyone forgets also run el client instance fix setup fast stake start leaking
366570,think gets real spicy price everything probably start cratering cex defi stuck lol
366571,specific scenario think chain still advance able finalize there's enough % stake attesting
366572,see
366573,also l2 keep functioning right 
366574,might depend l2
366575,51% stake chain make progress 23 finalize apparently
366576,there's definitely world makes sense removing borrowinglending type leveraged positions preemptively
366577,migrating another safer time
366578,like want wait chain start working can't know oracle price eth people furiously market selling every exchange bcuz eth iz ded
366579,5k would approx 17x18x19 around 54 assets 151820 4 almost maths simplified version permutation maths way enough case 
366580,that's think collections never doubles
366581,divide 55 numbers attributes want tada
366582,that's strict minimum better increase base layers bit redundant
366583,lol true almost decentralized social networks ive installed new tumblr year half ago called newlife made blockchain creatives artists weirdos extremely minimal interface words icons supposed intuitive still sure think often forget navigate likes lenght pressing image finger shows much like stop pressing another imagevideo pops feeds ai come better results potential reinvent social media mainly navigation bit sketchy strange certainly interesting parts builders need check would love hear opinions maybe kinds social networks already exist havent seen much minimal tiktok
366584,idk want implicate children crypto
366585,web3 elements pehaps
366586,newlife social network looks like mobile
366587,github idea list please send ser oxngmi
366588,indeed judging child plays roblox part clout part better metaverse experience owning digital assets better homes utilities cars able get parts virtual world quicker able unlock stuff get trying hard earn virtual moneypoints ask parents purchase fiat wouldnt care points earning crypto long get hold virtual asset like within world edit ive seen talking social networks games
366589,
366590,
366592, note easy confuse ideas dope seem like humanity needs real problems people need solutions
366593, 
366594,
366595,incredible story 
366596,sure statement defi lending place used traditional real word entities overcollateralization statement suggests overcollateralization problem defi lending isnt used real economy dont think thats really accurate lombard credit pawnshop loans counter examples obviously saying one take loan pawnshop except maybe pawning dirty undies
366597,yup big volatility price overcollateralization better
366598,remember seeing wallet runs security checks submitting txs forgot name anyone remember
366599,mostly agree defo like anyone knows works traditional world postraise
366600,good others arent
366601,1 actually pretty tough get good partners even vc firm good
366602,firm partner dealing
366604,reach good ones
366605,better rely personal opsec mate rather outofthebox solutions
366606,
366607,
366608,like anything else demand project choice investors choice research look previous investments talk founders etc
366609,nice people posted already
366610,thx links i'll keep debate another time personally bullish better security ux marginal users trying find what's front rn
366611,people still waiting
366612,
366613,another project like rai working similar ideas released yet anyone knows could talking
366614,bankdev
366615,bro he's youtuber ahah overthink much
366641,unfortunately impl contract verified 
366642,probably decompilation thats nicest way tbh 
366643,yeah probably youre right maybe good watch bit think little less life like box chocolates 
366644,hello sers anyone claimed evmos rektdrop link faucet initial gas maybe thanks anyway attention
366645,emm want explore kinds crypto element attract younger users
366647,lobs builds airdrops hopefully useful infrastructure works updateable merkle proofs token vesting builds claim ui based deployed contract reach think ways extend framework integrate would love hear devs 
366648,google evmos faucet
366649,gentle reminder running eth mainnet el node eg geth erigon nethermind besu etc also need run clbeacon chain client alongside merge connect together node stop syncing new blocks
366650,get practice currently merged testnets like kiln ropsten sepolia
366651,great reminder fact made crystal clear execution node runners imo
366654,hey guys i'm looking understand tokenomics beginner good resources suggest thx
366655,
366658,thank guys also technical resources investing
366659, 
366660,
366661,builders feel kycing gitcoin round claims
366662,
366663,wrote bullshit governannce curious u think
366664,
366665,fuck ew
366666,experienced completely decentralized ao thoughts dao develop well token bring revenue imo dao built around interest contribute order get revenue rather interest contribute order earn tokens token game earn tokens rather develop product projects get revenue even bear market much better base make dao even stronger
366667,makes sense yup
366668,1
366669,really see reason token well product makes revenue revenue used dao develop projectpay salaries even invest projects potentially could increase revenue reduce costs project governance could used nft 1nft1 vote
366670,pure revenue stuff never scale enough want grow acquire users go exponentail live 2% margins need create capital credit debt
366671,otherwise get outrun create
366672,great thoughts ivan ty share
366673,agree much stable volatile asset token issued later additional perks base
366674,one thing make dao sustainable financial wise always goal 1 another making profits dont find motivating relevant
366675,dont wanna go exponential stay smaller vibes league never make token
366676,well successful product built around idea around getting profit
366677,like social nonfinancial dao
366678,1 teams already token live look alter emission schedule
366679,would love add 2 cents came idea dao governed nft holders nft contract owned dao dao controls emissions sales like sort investor board
366680,kinda lobsterdao technically speaking
366681,think dealing spectrums categories idea im building know ill never work trad org ever
366682,even rug images lol
366683,ok maker application rejected
366684,whoops really wasnt aware lobsters structure would love buy lobster asap
366685,another problem daos token tokenomics even 2016 still work almost active suffer bad tokenomics
366686,cc pshenichnyy
366687,buzzed bears struct lobster born last year
366688,tried decentralise day one biggest mistake work carreer
366689,could anyone introduce someone wallet connect interested v2
366690,since wen non fungible token token issuing nfts token issuance arw reducing supply guess incentivising secondary market fractionalized nfts probably nft governed dao tokenless dao tokenless dao formed wallet addresses way ponderate different commitment members therefore becomes inefficient
366691,agree nfts token case
366692,one layer abstraction funny cat image
366693,yes token completely different economics nfts rather made tokens nft like right x z token game earn tokens
366694,always problem dao ecosystems conflicts interests high user turnover
366696,nft personalized know belong want
366698,ethereum devs since 2018 like
366699,somehow agree economics part erc20erc721 technical specifications standards may end resultyou erc20 max supply 10k make non transferable play erc721 minted millions real difference practical terms erc20 meant relevant part economic dynamics plan healthy incentive mechanism incentivize coordination multiple parties different interests one single goal dump neighbour techs mere tools matters essence game dynamic
366702,big difference part inflation usually tokens staked get apy annual inflation witch without new users creates sell wall nfts inflated new buyers
366704,think got point tbh nfts staked well want million things staking erc20 erc20 vs erc721 whatever incentive mechanism dynamics design matters anyhow said somehow agree protocol value transfer place incentivize healthy development community 
366705,

366769,far know 3ac assets liquidated simon dixonteam moving restructuring package celsius assets dumped mkt sucessfull sell pressure coming celsius' distressed assets big boys trying clean mess
366770,stated teh docs assets liquidated data
366771,genesis assets liquidated form gbtc shares approx 510mln 23bln liquidated taking gbtc shares price avg today start 30k sell
366772,tbf marginal 10% improvement block times crunch avg 14s almost certain 12s yes direct fee impact
366776,mean vesting contract used 
366777,ways around token lockups either way
366778,sell locked tokens via means make hedging trades
366779,shouldnt
366780,locked locked
366781,yeah would able hedge probably
366782,ya theyre locked chain whos going stop chain action
366783,way gold locked vault one moving around even though economy backed 50100 years ago
366784,still adds friction though
366785,anything claim lobster dao nft weeks
366786,

366788,join nft gated chat
366789,hi anybody knows check sizes ethereum testnets fullnode
366790,help
366791,please
366792,what's point hiding data dapp connect wallet web2 minded devs
366793,points increase conversion dapps require wallet related data probably easier hide instead mock web2 minded users also angry stupid thing works nonpower users
366794,strange merge make lido dao 1 sell ldo low price looks like understand something
366795,secondary market decided give ldo premium members decide disregard kinda ye indeed sure timing smart also given tokens r liquid
366796,ftx immediately announced perp listing proposal went live
366798,steth l2 merge best narratives lido
366799,
366800,mostly fugazi like jerking useless math
366801,can't imagine scale winter lido sells tokens operations next 2 years people start talking merge
366802,merge old news 2 years like 1559
366803,well know pretty bad timing like founders space need learn chikun eth foundation prepare ship harsh weather
366804,protocol wait proper conditions market deploy features promised deliver specific time
366805,yes date one longawaited event crypto space
366806,dumping bags feature
366807,talk steth unlocks ldo
366808,im talking ldo dunno think der
366809,sorry dont get affect winter could please explain
366810,we're discussing proposal lido dao want sell 2% ldo get money next 2 years looks like preparing winter side merge affect ldo price positive manner
366811,oh gotcha thanks explaining see next way huge chance winter rn likely need cash keep operating time otherwise lay stuff also affects market could wrong 2% really dump also
366812,yeah point founders miss timing selling tokens todays environment doesnt necessarily represents top something middle lido team probably substratum 
366813,talking 2% supply huge amount
366814,alameda golding lido likely otherwise perps may big holder paid listing
366815,previously wanted sell 10k eth dai reason think better dive deeper topics may decided sell ldo instead eth 
366816,anyway considering arguments need pay salaries would situation
366817,followed data protocol made amount 30m last year
366818,looks like make enough money salaries
366819,eah need research cause metric protocol revenue share staking rewards goes protocol ldo holders node operators
366820,probably worth requesting better explanation side according straightforward logic highly doubt shady intentions especially considering fact eth foundation closely watching questions decentralization
366821,nothing shady dao sale always look kinda weird time secondary market participants wanted play merge narrative upset demand partly met dao sale pump forever said doesnt mean wont happen money needed proposal wasnt made would made 2 weeks
366822,ropsten 147gb rinkeby 202gb goerli 106gb

366834,know services like maybe verifyinvestor let submit kyc proof dao says yes accredited american citizen like basically zk kyc counterparty submit docs service processes docs gives output present ps need upcoming 2025 ico need product ready blz
366835,always counterparty wdym
366836,verifyinvestor dont actually give info party asking kyc gives output seems accredidation limited scope
366837,2017 ico meme imagine wending machine asking ur pub key verify
366838,lowkey legit need haha
366839,theres stuff like litentry fractal kilt run entire productsblockchains guess depends consider output legit enough acknowledge
366840,icos ser poduct thats working
366841,dont need whitepaper link
366842,also meh parachains
366843,doesnt least whatever documentation spits meaningful value
366844,litentry works used mint soulbound20 stuff phalaworldclaim via kilt inproduction chain used already stuff used anything registering identity dunno fractal forprofit company kyc outputting verified data need
366845,friend passed

366862,trying careful hard trust anyone days
366863,promise touch trade otherwise
366864,
366865,prime example 
366866,youre right paranoid almost must space although research fireblocks seems acceptable risk tradeoff
366867,insurance export keys funds lock pretty strong contractual agreement

366880,ok checked problem crypto banks overally close acc without notice might somehow connected nonlegal things many businesses moved moved well even pay tax stop banks government find loopholes close accounts etc
366882,talked ready longterm play court could take several years lol case need prove part laundering poor guy say
366883,yeah real ml laundry billions catch guy even paid tax really like site made dataset awesome much better dune dashboards
366884,reality also russia related banks laundered much worked paid right people advance
366885,they're xrp cripple schizo spammers
366886,bait see
366887,use wording bait conservative american boomers telegram
366888,another reason go bankless
366889,hey fam released small featureprotocol compounding fees univ3 published whitepaper explaining works feedback much appreciated 
366890,substrate sound cool 
366892,hello fam friend mine started crypto company helps web3 protocols companies compliantly hire onboard pay remote employees they're currently running user interviews week looking chat web3 crypto founders understand painpoints companies industry facing let know interested chatting nft drop farming rewards vetoken win unfortunatly least make life builder easier works
366893,hi i'm interested
366894,delete pdfs permitted google drive link thought might interest people curve enable 'permissionless' liquidity mining setup pool w factory gauge reward token ask curve approve distribution update user interface otherwise close permissionless also create custom script distributing rewards gauge week bc gauges week week currently using gelato instead chainlink keepers automate works either tool slow steady defi getting autonomous launching new token w liquidity incentives consider curve go governance vote noncrv rewards sushiswap onsen balancer bancor rip uniswapxtokenterminal etc problems solve fully decentralized way
366895,thank positing
366896,balancer exact thing would curious hear problems solved mind dm'ing
366897,speaking frankly documentation lbps interesting unclear permissionlessness rewarding xeth pools 3rd token really liked idea changing weighting pools time goal distribute pile tokens buyers directly price discovery create incentive create x token must minted protocol looking reward xeth pools x token w price discovery mechanism x raise eth daotreasury think balancer lbps would primary contender honestly opposed yeth lbp w rewards via lbp future curve clearly visible xeth rewards examples like stetheth rewarded ldo made easier coordinate wanted wo trying ask something newunheard see examples bal documentation outside lbps fair launch pricing
366898,describing possible managed pool available later year lbp designed incentives exist perpetuity noting lbp discussion separate curve cannot lbp's probably fair point may mention 3rd party reward tokens docs i'll look ldo thing balancer's wsteth pool though possible like curve ask us add reward token anyone could add reward token gauge would open attack vectors
366899,yes talked michael curve point addreward needs permission reduce attack vector yeah lbps totally different curve pools reviewed managed pool documentation originally misunderstood boosted pools wanted different balancer great regularly recommend people keep watch managed pools later year consider future projects
366900,audereestfacere
366901,would cool easy way avoid attack vectors tbf ideally we'd want remove gating much possible
366902,thanks sir
366903,hi dm
366904,chance post somewhere safe pdf's definitely go
366905,virustotal pdf b4 opening
366906,sometimes virustotal doesnt detect stuff though
366907,docsend best free tier lol annoying pay 10mo 12 docs haha
366908,set gdrive people read via google preview
366909, google drive link thanks
366911,unity devs looking paid work
366912,what's attack vector allowing token reward
366913,addreward unverified erc20 approve function secretly calling wethapprove baycapprove setapprovalforall similar users claimall rewards get scam token try use get drained
366914,help webweb3 stuff ser dm maybe ill find someone network
366915,smth way reward managers designed general calling random approve fns unverified contracts safe even within context calls approve token actually giving approval anywhere else
366916,thanks dmd
366917,sure understanding approve transfer unverified erc20 effectively known contract call inside eg wethtransferfrom victim hacker
366918,check reward token ask curve soon bal approve reward token verified etherscan fine
366919,wut
366920,wethtransferfromvictim hacker amt would require approval victim caller case aforementioned erc20 contract
366922,ok clarify thought reason permissionless addreward scam token could scamapprovemsgsender wethapprovemsgsender amount 2x scamtransfervictim hacker amount wethtransfervictim hacker amount wethbalancevictim could wrong possible though
366926,approve work like
366927,caller one approve
366928,another calling context
366930,gotcha ok attack vector different apologies thinking similar nft setapprovalforall something probably context specific idk attack vector
366943,away get callbacks node whenever new block comes
366944,geth websocket subscriptions similar might closest thing
366945,may easier use etherscan api issues polling blocks simply poll blocks node much easier loose data case
366946,ye think zhongfu nailed answer
366947, shared thoughts spvs better fit financing bottoms tinkering web3 moving us closer capital formation coordination moving speed innovation hoping hear opinions topic evolve thinking
366948,
366949,i've done developing apps typically metamask rpc connection used populate majority dapp data rather bakein separate rpc connection use user connects simpler conceal app user connects
366950,sort convinced better decision forcing user use api ask use web2 basically every page ever probably change thought process bake damn rpc
366951, ohm story continues
366952,chicken bonds
366953,enough
366954,fact
366976,yawn air dirty laundry somewhere else pls
366978,well kleros ubi drama fair discussion tho sad became drama instead actual discussion
366980,yes wanted share article discuss sorry everyone
366981,hmm
366987,think problem people built proof humanity sybilresistant registry community that's grew around basic income different priorities trade offs depending vision
366988,i'll step conversation lobster become drama seems best place dicussion would project's governance forum
366989,q used able press functions github see declared stuff right form website seems like feature disapeared smth example 
366990,what's wrong flashbot rpc recently txns never going much stable better options trades 
366991,maybe 
366992,mev protected want rpc use pocket network
366993,oof sucks rpcs arr left offers private transactions
366994,sure tbf
366995,maybe bloxroute
366996,wonder manifold sambacha allows private rpc usage fill void
366997,think charge service one gasnow closed last year
366998,yeah charge 015 per bundle 
366999,largest issue flashbots protect people spammed shit free
367000,cant nice things
367001,txn even going stuck fails later
367002,how's eden network better option
367003,provide rpc retail traders protection front running
367005,find number users analytics platforms like nansen dune
367006,hi guys anyway somehow one look coin twapped
367007,like bought constantly
367008,block x block table pool address eoa address asset dexdata
367009,name uniswap pool feetier block range pull
367010,im looking binance alts
367011,im technical im sorry
367012,could pull orderbook every trade map market orders see consistency
367013,twap best visualized chart tbh
367014,yes
367015,im searching methods identify twap
367016,usually deterministic pattern write deterministic logic classify otherwise i'd train ml model course given labeled data possible generate using simulation
367018,id look % orders cross spread buy sell persepctive
367020,
367021,think sth that's worth long form discussion feels like could ab test stuff
367022,uni governance one biggest jokes space funny reading things like sets precedent whole industry
367023,10% lp fees
367025,guys good suggestions tool good publishing visualizing data currently used notion also came across mirrorxyz wondering options recommended
367026,neither seem geared data viz smth like observable hq would mind
367027,never heard let check
367028,1 observable
367029,yea looks quite cool 
367030,also got suggestion obsidian used substack
367031,check others saved hopefully find something useful
367032,thank
367033,damn really cool
367034,could always create charts data viz platforms upload blogs i'm still figuring plan right thanks new resources add catalog guys
367035,wash trader looks spent 25eth washtrade addy looks staked course trying understand good way estimate real fees addy incurring look lol amount looks staked % total pool starters
367036,vega one love
367037,quite easy get data ape slice pandas plot altair outputs vegalite
367038,hi guys think optimistic bridging compared locally atomic externally mpc multi sig natively light client header verified think future bridging
367039,think really falls understanding underlying trust assumptions trade offs optimistic bridging gain simplicity reduce costs security weaker light clients video ethereum engineering group quasisok different bridging approaches highly recommend predates nomad touches optics nomads born work optics 
367041,buy eden tokens wallet eden rpc work wallet good alternative flashbots cheapfree work across wallets
367042,anyone tested illiquidmarket legit want make otc deal heard
367043,wallet staked eden generally good backup flashbots relay submitting bundles tokens required
367044,really many full stack web3 developers looking jobs messages specifically tg scamsbots purpose
367045,98% scams real devs time post messages multiple tg's day deal constant things build nonlegit offshore recruiters harrasment 
367046,scamsbots bad quality recommended
367047,without holding tokens use front run protection right alternative flashbots read pokt provide front run protection
367048,manifold finance aka securerpccom
367049,add rpc wallet
367050,change metamask settings like adding new rpc details website
367051,
367052,damn need airdrops
367053,70% instadumped
367054,tbh dont think wrong perp dump made extra efforts deploy supported ecosystem early decided could used rewards maybe chose instead ps unless dao founders sell dao owned tokens case afaik
367055,guys heard whether snx stakers get op tokens
367057,unless tongnk says misinterpreted getgo
367058,think realistic daos hoard non revenue tokens polite next 2 years we'll see widespread collapse daos diversify stables worthless treasury honestly surprised uma range tokens get popular daos
367059,ser asked question chat rules dm 3
367060,already happened first daos 2017 year followed 20182019 bear market unfortunately left almost dead community 12 devs working projects spare time
367061,lesson learnt
367062, hopefully daos waking least hold ethwstethusdc garbage unfortunately lot allin supply
367063,one reasons core team mostly devs without business background experienced
367064,exactly we're building resonate need system deploy native treasury tokens high particularly deployment result slow diversification
367065,new sip said snxeth lpers get
367066,snx stakers im wrong
367067,really really difficult dao's diversify treasury pretty much stage successfully end like nexus mutual governance wars people try get dissolve pay treasury token holders
367068,idk problem 'deploy' indistinguishable dump early true believers completely different dapps completely different fundamentals revenue flows 8090% correlated average crypto buyer including institutions gets way savvy daos continue fail advise small hedge fund crypto took months get onto gnosis safe understanding aave works take short positions permissionlessly multidecade experienced traders crypto mindfuck
367069,gemini gusd mean isnt anyhow creditor 3ac right gusd solvent
367070,lobsters excited zkevm 
367071,know problem add risk management governance % apy revenue autoconverted stablecoin could weekly monthly whatever
367072,genesis winklewoss venture apparently knows
367073,that's probably best way clear revenue stream makes less competitive time one reasons uni turned fee switch subsidizing revenue token emissions probably best way around token emissions issues like obscuring real usage data
367074,gemini earn's biggest counterparty genesis know much gemini impacted i'd imagine 
367075,thanks avoid
367077,
367080,jump didnt lose much luna case 
367081,made profit
367082,thats works times 0 fee 001% fee play big role big traders good liquidity use secure liquid platforms good ux even project revenue still sell % treasury worst times economics strategy built advance
367083,case dex's time fee comes lp's pocket traders gmx trader pays fee part goes glp's part goes protocol glp subsidized token dydx mm's provide deep liquidity good pricing get tokens curve vecrv holders get admin fee would normally go lp's lp's subsidized tokens even nondex's similar patterns lido takes cut staking still well ahead competition steth liquid integrated everywhere token incentives large role paying level integration liquidity yeah protocol's take fees without pattern normally wonderful niche little competition ens example agree always sell portion treasury hard orchestrate cuz community often see sushiswap see maker
367084,agree users care fee much comes price impact
367085,cant even get op airdrop introduced blue kyc requirements
367086,case curve lps get crv gives access fees pools well exposure fees pools without exposed assets pool
367087,yeap agreed that's i'm thinking early decentralised transition go slower daos gain experience governance metrics changed start proposals described details risk outcomes usually vote think future either enough background understand well
367088,think precedent shows real culture allegiance american vc cryptoopen source ethos
367089,thought smart make lusd arb printing looks like moron eventually leveraged position dies 3% drop try get 10k usd 15m notional anyway lol rekt still poor back work random numbers

367152,looll
367153,go read wiki uniswap v3 github repo
367154,clone read deleted
367155,section fees well read urself find
367156,well done xmons

367159,
367160, polygon team pvp mode 
367161,they're finalized onchain sure
367162,oof yeah stupid question curious breakdown btw chain otc vs onchain guess see people would trade onchain
367163, curious hear drives volume dexs compared centralized ones
367164,tokens gamble retail
367165,dex volume retail driven whenever see high volatility ton trading desks arbitraging might dig little deeper want reinvent wheel could literature review type search
367166,otc bit brood title tbh otc deals miners buyers enormous amounts btc example quick 100k otc deals trading desks make sense onchain tracking reasons
367167,hmmm yeah think i'm asking along lines firms like wintermute gsr kraken
367168,sneg55 said one thing lot coins trade dex's cex's obvious reasons another kyc similar issues deal dex's many different benefits downsides
367169,wintermute guys utilizes cex's entirely believe close trades
367170,probably deeper book faster finalization trades
367171,clearpool kind otc pools permissioned pools ex jane street blocktower one
367172,know trades lending related
367175,think another reason could except univ3 dexs based passive lping whereas cexs generally require active market making result cexs tend regularly adapt incorporate new pricing information virtue frequently updating orderbook even arent trades happening whereas prices produced passive lp dexs less often updated lps passive except univ3 sense waiting arbitrageurs come push prices back line trading agains pool naturally prices tend lag behind proactive lps actively market make passive lp dexs liquidity lower slippage result trading volume one would expect see larger trades needed update prices accordingly incorporate new pricing information illustrate consider extreme case theres one cex active mms one passive lp dex infinite liquidity theres new pricing information clearly rather easy mms update prices somewhat quickly reflected new orderbook state cex however prices dex require infinite trades update pool balances reflect new price attracting infinite trading volume
367182,augur issue fixed number betshares per bettopic
367183,memory hazy using catnip iirc lps could mint yesno shares
367184,
367186, one
367187,popular usa 2020 election
367188,someone etherscan ethcc
367189,shit tons bots running sandwich trades stuff well right
367190,best current blockchain node provider deploy tokencontract
367194,
367195,yeah makes sense ie volatility typically causes volume that'd relegated dexs since frequent price differences would mean arbitrage oppurtunities i'm curious would ratio volume btw cex amd dex ever change significantly
367196, idk feels passive aggressive ton data sources dex cex trades correlationcausality studies know bringing trading bots sandwich attacks
367197,yes exactly higher vol causes arb opportunities dexs also cexs given prevalent passive lping many dexs leads trading volume one would expect effect become pronounced tvl theres passive lp dexs arb opportunities get bigger arbitrageurs trade bigger sizes agains pools theyre back line paradoxically one could argue higher tvl passive lp dexs actually makes price discovery somewhat slower less efficient need move capital get new pricing info reflected pool balances implied spot prices guess theres somewhere sweet spot though want meaningful tvl passive lp dexs able absorb normal trade sizes much tvl could actually become detrimental efficient price discovery need lot trading volume keep markets line
367198,
367199,
367200,tried existing rpc solutions claims provide flashbot protections reality none actually work basic eth rpc much faster txns never get stuck anything tried flashbot eden manifold securerpc txns never go fails
367201,issues manifold sambacha might able help
367202,likely get looked raising github issue manifold
367204,closing closing speech 25h later
367206,see mean price discovery slower would market wait trade large tvl amm finishes executing seems like market would want price discovery happen speed fastest element
367207,
367208,yeah maybe word slower wasnt ideal meant tend need trading volume dex incorporate new market info compared cex regularly updating orderbook also without trades happening
367209,
367210,hmmmmm mean token traded amms yes there's really equivalent l2 data amm world yeah incorporate data streams god knows sources long takes maybe already exists speed price discovery would time incorporate l2 like data amms time orders execute token also traded order book exchanges consensus order book price discovery happens amms exist quick liquidity speed price discovery rate happens order books could argue amms aid price discovery would love see reseaech conduct one literature yet even i'd guess speed price discovery speed fastest amm trade bit slower order books moment though
367211,adding slowness large tvl amms game theory conclusions example pretend 1 order book exchange price discovery happens 2 amms 1 significantly larger tvl would market overall incentives allow arbitrage happen low tvl amms therefore pricing larger arbitrage opourtunities larger tvl amm perhaps easy comparing multiple frequency arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage
367212,think amms dont really contribute price discovery thats little bit point trying make earlier amm passive lps waiting arbitrageurs come adapt amm isnt really taking active role price discovery arbitrageur whos pushing amm line thereby establish price discovery relates back question might reason increasing trading volume dexs compared cexs think one reason dex amms passive need arbitrageurs adjust new prices entails trading volume order kind update dexs amm state amount trading volume needed higher passive lp tvl
367213,ahaha see point assuming amms adjust price market arbitrage conclusions 1 amm volume course driven volume order books 2 ratio amm volume dex would increase higher volume environment since right much less volume amms approx equal increase absolute volume much higher percentage increase total trading volume amms
367214,yeah whats interesting also think staleness large tvl pools could potentially find interpreted market signal ie lps remain passive accident laziness choice staleness pool gets whole different meaning one might consider deviation compared cex wrong sense cex dex
367215,going back dashboard shared noticeable bumps volume that's attributed amms that'd suggest amms still found use cases would drive significantly larger volume exchanges prevalent use cases i've seen dapps part amm ecosystem liquidity guys need super high volume trades 
367216,hypothesis would passive tvl dex pool higher vol given asset pair trading volume one might expect see capital kind energy needed flow update dex compared cex markets
367217,reading amm papers megabrain team chitraevansangeris last year ive come opposite conclusion amms simply passive amms hold latent potential space arbs part necessary ecosystem moreover symbiotic relationship two organisms yet fully understood explored price discovery obvious first order effect relationship hints something far complex coming future perhaps amms appear passive today theyre awaiting innovation unlock
367218,yeah totally agree referring currently prevalent cfmms excluding univ3 afaik bigger one moment requiring active lping require arbitrageurs eliminate price discrepancies yeah open amm term also include types amms also havent even discovered yet guess youre right
367219,hmmm worry even claim say cex dex people different views pricing would reason there's incentive trade across two case there's much execution risk dexs
367220,yeah agree although depends way lps behave dex example dex lps always passive dex prices always long wasnt arbitrageur move back line
367221,paper detail complexities would see 2 possible ways amms could add complexities 1 investors execution traders look pricing across venues amms order books otc desks batch auction exchanges etc would certainly impact price discovery happens setting expectation right current pricing amms indirect way contributing price discovery 2 amms used bootstrap liquidity conducting large private transactions la like fashion sizable private investment fashion think already happening degree also links paper
367222,octolinker need
367223,actually guess 3rd innovationcomplexity first version already implemented uniswap v3 allowing stakers choose price range would like yields think staking positions equivalent l2 data order books someone would rather stake take position market would stakers group incentives discover prices efficient way left answered amms figure catch 2 birds price discovery easy liquidity that'd breakdown current paradigm easy liquidity vs price discovery
367224,several papers propose range payoff functions mathematically possible also allude end linked paper future work complex financial products discovered seriously favour read last 12 months papers guys wrote arxiv
367225,lawyer papers get really excited industry create decentralised capital efficient derivatives natively amms hard regulators get genie back bottle

367296,jfc even touched powr lol
367297,
367298,eh saw plenty coins touch criteria mentioned yeah seemed focus lot centralizationfakedecentralization

367302,comms funding dao voting share
367303,yeah there's dialogue criteria weighted howie test multiple criteria asset fall every criteria howie test security
367304,12 known 3 kinda known 56 issue hard took words context
367305,common knowledge jfc reached hard lot interpret worst possible way
367306,mean even mentioning exchanges even application exchanges rekt
367307,
367308,also hell else refer something personally worked another person thing that's paddlin dev diary updates that's paddlin
367309,works guess im set
367310,stuff everyone used know verboten
367311,everyone knew never talk shareholders dividends allocating funds exchanges marketing 2019 happened seems mass amnesia event go docs many crypto project today read distribute dividends
367312,completely different story act applying exchange interpreted promising value futureetc
367313,mutually inclusive
367314,previously
367315,remember projects prior 2019 tightlipped matter fear getting rekt sec
367316,that's people still talk announcing intent apply things yet happened mostly holds true however regarding fact something announced fact also singled simply applying exchange
367317,see far projects talking listing exchanges nowadays prior 2019 sec started going projects
367319,even
367320,insane
367321,there's difference vs there's difference talking openly simply applying i'm aware sec nailing anyone specifically saying applied exchange listings xyz exchange someone wants boob use we're applying exchange guys that's one thing often see however retweeting information already happened applying exchange listing kind different hope see
367322,also paragraph 156 page 43
367323,unpopular opinion suppose aside playing fast loose profits effort others profits solely effort others minor aside clear dare say there's lot justified tldr sure trying build business
367324,last paragraph pg 53first pg 54 pretty bad lol
367325,honestly wouldnt hate world projects basically stick weve already built deployed future promises crazy obviously unachievable roadmaps maybe explanation vision think could done within params im obviously saying rules good make sense overpromising underdelivering pretty wild
367326,that's basically sec guidelines part 
367327,there's never thorough endorsement liquity model lol
367328,hey everyone futures market way pay gas fees advance ethereum 
367329,chi token

367333,hello guys could please share websites testnets ambassador programs
367334,throughout relevant period nikhil ramani repeatedly traded ahead coinbase listing announcements trading least 25 tokens alleged greater detail nine crypto asset securities offered sold issuer raise money would used issuers business hallmarks definition security continue true nine crypto asset securities subject trading complaint sure would love know 16 made alive lol
367336,ridiculous catch22 list dao central party vet communications catch stuff nobody see contributors everyone tries bring something table based understanding dao's mission expected understanding might misguided even hurt dao see people pulling makerdao different directions example points similarly ludicrous trying fit completely opposite views single thing sec even bother define job harassing children they've done terrible job space far setting us decades back innovators parts world taking

367366,centralisation point would also cover multisig operations ie matter sec whether centralisation equals core team small group people potential decisionmaking power
367367,find multisig mentions per se team major vote terms governance criticisms apeir99n
367368,keeper onchain automated jobs like fiverr suggesting regular escrow even mention defi trusted party perform introducing many complexities kleros type things telegram handle onchain keep mind believe new owner cant change owner day needs 7 days change nothave 2fa
367369,mention defi defi means decentralized finance coin buying
367370,day come devs focus bridging inter chain bridging everything blockchain database
367371,simple universal escrow convenient
367372,could use multisig wallet
367373,mentioning nothing onchain unless introduce rep protocol stake slashed court says work cute
367374,also thanks sir know requirement changing ownership groupchannel applies indeed soon former owner taken care things change immediate final
367375,know that's reworded chain digital asset honest fact digital irrelevant could selling horse signing indeed transferred physically new owner attach nft photo buyer proof irl contract whatever convenient actually good example irl could check irl buyer transferred funds digital country even cannot check
367376,complex makes sense
367377,that's brought bisq table buyerssellers use cash that's totally chain thing ways make secureish bisq defi

367491,thanks ser
367492,orbital resonance made think stablecoins defi mechanisms good analogy 
367493,yeah there's trend towards increasing censorship bancor tg mentioning foundation bailout become taboo transparency regards 100m raised ico surprised somehow squandered like celsius 3ac
367494,think would better wait official statements regarding matter speculateanyhow withdraw funds deposit bancor
367495,hard speculate foundation goes dead silent since il protection turned provide zero transparency funds team giving written responses bancor foundation nothing bancor dao sole purpose fund protocol development however that's case look snapshot voting bancor foundation used vote yes certain proposals recently voting abstain abstain votes bit like wolf sheep's clothing without abstain votes many proposals would met quorum
367496,hey anyone know way get list testnet faucet addresses anyone published anything like

367504,wanting hedge instead transaction inclusion risk actually price per se

367523,hey feel free dm i'm gamma run automated rebalancing strategies based certain rebalance triggers work
367538,curiosity possible create something like gpt3 dalle blockchain using decentralized processors like render something obstructions
367539,decentralised data storage processing power magnitudes expensive
367540,models hundreds gb
367541,like adjust costs infrastructural deficiencies blockchain comes creating similar models
367542,think maybe 100s tbs
367543,depends want tbh decentralized model training decentralized execution
367544,look federated learning ways training part
367545,open source code decentralized processing incentives data knowledge providers
367547,there's alrdy open source models train
367548,well open data sets
367549,ig could set market get training data perdatum evaluation useful model training seems like would best greatly increase training time
367550,think even dalle codexgithub copilot trained open source data sets
367551,decentralized processing mean different service provider runs model time
367552,something like render
367553,sry i'm familiar link
367554,
367556,honestly idk there's need decentralized model thinking loud

367561,projects try xyz blockchain
367562,going put medical records blockchain data
367563,yeah thinking lines
367564,time design gives leverage donate data research anonymously earning incentives
367565,ex 
367566,decentralized 
367567,seems rly far fetched ngl avg price individual user data prolly cents sure commodifying lead higher prices
367568,reads like runofthemill render farm business token
367569,think anyone leverage gpu network yeah permissionless
367570,research labs spend thousands get data sometimes yeah every kind data going highly priced mostly focused utility
367571,call aws decentralized use follow rules would
367572,set gpu setup aws
367573,that's point analogy
367574,maybe framed wrong
367575,back origin q hand think decentralized model training still infancy pay compute results often less competitive top models quite large compute scale large need high requirements nodes end result rly much better
367576,yeah wanted discuss points failure system created onchain
367577,also decentralization wrt servers anyone provide gpus rendering single entity controlling network yeah infra specific protocols debated
367578,unless they're hiding something single entity definitely controlling network business 
367582,interested learn whats going decentralized science rec recent talk juan benet ethereum explainer 
367583,
367585,
367586, audius community treasury hacked
367587,much
367589,1856449781999999 audio tokens 03 like 6m
367591,damn another one
367592,1kk
367593,good deal
367594,
367595,
367598,actually really interesting 23andme hack something like actually needed
367599,fine print policies definitely interesting 
367600,whats best dev resources aptos
367601,anything specific
367605,metamask wants make sign set approval nft transaction eg gem way see doublecheck nft contract calling function sending transaction
367606,pls way recover lost google authenticator account one
367608,2fa may stored cloud backup device icloudgoogledrive device backup dont know ways unfortunately way cloud backup copy protected way data phone talking requests gov orgs thats good thing remember
367609, thanks
367610,far i'm concerned google authentificator unfortunately case stores data locally used ios last 4 years may wrong
367611,correct afaik app settings icloud backed keys locally stored recently export qr codes manual backups chances restoring still access old device
367612,yeah know access old devicethat asked help
367613,dune's shortlist good resources agree good 
367615,like tradfi traders prefer trading delta neutral options strategies purely betting vol pre post event earinngs etc i'm seeing crypto events token unlocks airdrops etc dov products selling events bassed short straddlesstrangles anyone knows crypto funds trading strategy deribiti seen patterns paradigm otc thanks
367616,yes several eg qcp 
367617,deep otm focused theta decay guess looking something like also agree premise 1 events crypto 2 events actually much vol impact equity earning events
367618,deribit trade btc eth sol optionsso whatever typed isnt much applicable except sol dov priced whatever mms need unlocks straight away used liquid staking locked
367619,dont think crypto option markets sophisticated yet basically good liquidity btc eth iv im seeing mostly reactive proactive isnt really equivalent earnings crypto
367620,going build ilbased straddlesstrangles though care trading events might become interesting
367621,ohh nice also issue liqudity mostly exists btc eth many events predictable vol shocks 2 however many long tail tokens thinking ways pull short atm straddle like payoff via uni v3 lp positions usdc pair token
367622,whats checklist sophistication
367623,yeah going uni v2 first makes liquidity much available basically assume amm lps already selling vol buyers leveraged buy il turn straddle seller also go leveraged short
367624,think iv responding events vix fed fomc would good sign sophistication ive traded options bit period times iv rose rv squeeze already
367625,option trading providers assets one trade options types collateral
367626,consistent iv across top 23 cexs dexs least cash settled options top 20 token pairs tvl uni pools
367627,think guys underestimate little people care options
367628,speak
367629,uni v2 can't decide strikes right coz limit orders
367630,making market sol hard
367631,long way go expect liquid options like 20 defi tokens lmao
367632,try fit il gamma delta curves existing options get option strikes 20% otm monthly expiry options
367633,andrey said option markets crypto sophisticated
367634,central point price open position
367635,think sophisticated wrong word
367636,got
367637,mature 
367638,agree v3 gives flexibility eventually well want concentrated
367639,ya better plenty sophisticated players less people covered cheeto dust punting btc options couch less external unpredictable events try price iv strange way crypto somewhat boring
367640,less unknowns less volume less opportunity
367641,theres education sure example trade perps 34x leverage sell options get returns massive theta funding rate
367642,eh
367643,reason trade options outlook iv
367644,i'd say unknowns tho
367645,dont trading perps
367646,point accept liquidations perps youd easily accept options
367647,seller dont care fast price goes somewhere iv like nice bonus
367648,deribit really shitty retail trader tho stop losses except apis
367649,every place doesnt liquidity
367653,ive ditched google authenticator favor authy imho strictly better app use simultaneously several devices free
367654,cringes enormously shitty web2 service forces use sms 2fa
367655,otpauth even better asymmetrical keys strictly better thank totp server also knows secret use yubikey possible
367656,phone rooted android access 2fa seeds unlikely apply people
367657,many reasons buy atm call longing perp want bet direction 1 hedged downside liquidation 2 added benefit long gamma get timing right
367658,vasadev ser reason gem bulk sender unverified contract
367659,never understood whole liquidation thing difference making sub account 100 putting 100 atm option
367660,long gamma leverage almost exact perps
367661,diff sub account hits stops youre done option expires right youre betting like 10x leverage godsend
367662,yep boils leverage money management felxibility get 100 via instruments
367663,thats true paying flexibility
367664,imo people fall love options wrong reason
367665,agree coz learn right way need collateral money learning wrong way cheaper perps guess 
367666,crypto asset class needs short vol instruments trying picture right trigger points happen
367667,agree still need tactical buys
367668,surely joke right
367669,alfa vault nicely creates abstraction v3 make easy manage v2 rebalancing position saving fees
367671, also noteworthy
367672,careful sms otp restore option cause targeted sim swap attacks
367675,ser
367676,ok kinda embarrassing opened option aco auctus protocol point last year arbitrum going accounts took ages find wtf token named aco eth3500usdcc17sep210800utc even eventually figured weird thing aped last year good let's twitter search something approve exploit shit quickly revokecash ed approved anything seems ok twitter says updates follow auctusproject easy account doesnt exist fuck rekt anyone knows get something still possible wants engage lost treasure hunt
367677,kinda needless say app really work anymore
367678,im delving lending protocol breakdown found resources compound can't find aave euler rari fuse pointers
367679,looking particular aave pretty thorough documentation
367680,care send contracts ser know nothing auctus would like take look
367681,sure pool options option token 
367682,really appreciate hildobby good ser true gent tips hat replaces monocle
367683,course happy help 
367684,hello everybody launched creative storytelling competition tezos like analog photography creative writing go visit page know 
367685,serious comment 
367686,encrypted restore password
367687,seem odd anyone
367688,otter account engagement farming weeks account seems troll malicious pleb dunno ignore moving forward imho
367689,today account suspended good
367690,yes understand anyone feels put position feel need speak something directly something happening possibly unrelated issue fud'd unfortunately unintentionally serve legitimize party
367691,well youre swing trading youre likely gonna use 34x leverage take profit 1020% gain sell atm options get leverage price targets youre earning 50100% apr funding position get liquidated theres real risk difference perps selling options
367692,options market mostly bitcoin
367693,little none liquidity coins ethereum somewhat also matured enough yet
367694,im hearing options market going replace perps years seems like crypto invented perps still attractive gamblers
367695,hi know token blacklisted
367696,token address 
367697,yeah theyre really hard market make imho perps gateway drug feel limitations really wish deribit wasnt shit liquidity coins 
367698,shit retail trading platform
367699,deribit great bitcoin options tho
367700,like usdt token honeypot token one scammers use private keys pishing dms
367701,coming due time tradfi mms bringing
367702,platform liquidity ye interface limiting
367703,nothing coming shitcoins still dominate perps
367704,genius derivative
367705,also provide eth options
367706,bitcoin still moves mostly perps
367707,research came months ago carol alexander showing 70% ish crypto volatility transmits binance btcusdt perp
367708,yeah mean impact options bitcoin surely nothing pointing options replace perps far mb biggest tardfi like citadel possible big firms already like jump etc
367709,options mostly used hedging right dealers
367710,think good solvable reasons hasnt happened yet definitely easy tradfi tools
367711,huge fundamental flaw exchanges reporting perps flow binance ftx sucks data
367712,think big problem
367713,bitmex unironically transparent data
367714,wym
367715,options find outright manual clickable arbitrages options defi cex real question hit volume hedge observed tested personally didnt see point ansatz orders honeypots id interested know anyone observed tested
367716,bitfinex 
367717,collateralization terms defi options bad arbs might worth less risk free rate tbh
367718,report data real time
367719,rather update like liquidations oi etc
367720,theyre quite wide tbh seems dealers updating regularly leaving stale prices hanging get feeling doesnt matter though signal transmitted would enough compensate
367721,wut
367722,alpha nerds im dumb execute 
367723,yeah think options one things left untapped arbing
367724,due low amount people actually using guess
367725,deribit vs bybit looked quite sync last time checked refreshing pages two screens saw lot differences took find something didnt lead annoying errors negative yields
367726,solvable though feel ike biggest issue overcollaterisation
367727,think issue volumes nonexistent market participants options market making extremely sophisticated start taking lunch wont long
367728,need credit lines really break real power options consumergrade covered options really think need fnfts good marketplace 
367729,ah thought meant defi cex arb
367730,surprise bybit planet even perps liquidation engine works completely differently others hence apes liquidated first prices surge premium every single time
367731,yeah found wider defi cex didnt use analysis post made analysis look bad
367732,that's hate proprietary nature current option marketplaces vaults neat many cases they're often highly centralized
367733,working making limited form options need supply interest rates collateral
367734,works straddlesstrangles start
367735,interesting talk we're building resonate expect produce large supply liquid interestrate exposures
367736,would work would take benchmark interest rate
367737,presume solution requires principal
367738,based il fairly easily build delta neutral long gamma position pockets il cant liquidated anything interest rate simulates theta
367739,real bumper would provide swaps collateralisation choice stablecoins biggest issue insti peg risk provide exposure fixed interest rate without requiring collateral stablecoins could interesting
367740,definitely want make interests market based
367741,mean purchasing rights interest streams stables yeah that's part we've built
367743,blz enough w shilling

367774,1m month pretty substantial
367776,would losing 1m month hurt sushi swap whole less people would using would stop users profiting 1m actually hurt sushiswap
367777,proposal capture mev frontrunning foldsushi backrunning bots profit idk read full proposal
367778,interesting calculated effect 1m monthly see proposal would target swaps occuring sushi guard private rpc sushi bot would access private mempool sushi execute arb way fold finance bot advantage bots profit calculated situation everyone trades using sushi guard
367779,fold finance actually got pretty good deal proposal basically allowed arbitrage sushi swap occured sushi guard mode without competitors 50% revenue arbitrage
367780,profit split 5050 fold holders manifold finance token sushi community sushi original idea last year give gas rebates users sushi could anything give gas rebates xsushi holders anything sushi wants
367781,new router live yet proposal passed implemented next days
367782,people hurt bots currently arb mev sushi transactions public mempool wont able anymore sushi transactions mev protected default kind like cowswap going securerpc rpc benefits sushi users transactions mev sushiguard back running make profits basically arbitrage dexes sushi users complete trades doesnt hurt sushi users sushiguard front running sushi transactions would hurt sushi users thats tradeoff benefit integration sushi capturing back running sushi transactions winwin
367783,wait sushi transactions mev protected default read seems quite ux change sushi
367784,oh also note revenue estimate manifold team includes gas savings using securerpc etc think thats 30% estimate wont actual cash revenue range wide notoriously hard estimate depends bunch different variables
367785,theres much theres bits pieces manifold finance site tweets documentation openmev securerpc sites run manifold picked hanging around manifold telegram oh theres quite tweets sushi last months sushiguard older version feature needed opt gave errors used ledgers etc updated version automatically capture sushi transactions without hassle
367788, pretty cool
367791,
367792,u guys think tyler ward scammer adhd founder
367793,fellow founder i'm struggling putting creative energy 2 projects time
367794,especially one needing lot attention switching many productive
367795,least 5
367796, usual serial entrepreneur 100 online businesses scam though never believe one thing enough print coins make money fuck hustler type trusted founder works something love diversify via bit investing thats fine one manage bags create serial businesses nah shit
367797,also every previous token farming new one lol
367799,smelled weird stuff tyler day 0 though much blabla scammer maybe good person maybe decent ideas smells devshop vibes lobsters devshop people idk
367800,lol obvious ponzi skem
367802,think diversifying stuff makes total sense previous projects reached maturity doesnt seem case tho
367803,maturity best demo version projects lol
367804,much worse actors though seems build something gives others oook wouldnt drink together
367805,dunno somehow person literally rugs honest someone scamming open like
367806,like bandit robs wild west versus kind person promises gold instead impoverishes whole family
367807,slow rugscam still scam separate 2 baskets different strategy
367808,ye equally suck tbh
367809,ask meant devshop
367811,second
367812,slowsoft rug worst
367813,feeding ppl hopes disgusting
367814,external development agency usually hire one development needs needless say looks real bad serious defi project
367815,vision mission participants care team shipping internal team external one tbh hiring better nowadays there's still big gap comes developers even touch costs aspect 
367816,advanced vision ever youre relying external team
367817,fair see sourcing minor aspect dev shops think bridge interfaces farming stuff idk core protocol never outsourced tho
367818,agree outsourcing core competencies seems somewhat odd
367819,anyone yearn vault contract written solidity
367820,
367821,hope guys like

367871,hey frens handy tool query worth uniswap nft given token id
367872,ah nevermind found
367873,think readable contract right
367874,hey wondering projects store addresses db mixed vs lowercase either lowercase everything use case insensitive search time
367875,using postgres specifically case
367876,guess postgres trigger auto lowercase could work already lower case unique indexes
367877,still annoying queries feel like shouldnt annoying handle
367878,row level triggers good usecase care performance add check constraint change wherever save data
367879,rust projects usually create intermediate type serves binding code db code stored dbs native type code translate
367880,ya guess we'll done till annoying
367882,write checksum addresses always query checksum addresses
367883,gets hard deal values certain address like topics logs
367884,
367887,hi guys find famous bridge aggregator w public api recommend
367888,otpauth even better authyautificator otp totp exact hotp timestamp
367889,ive diched youbekey favor authy well due versatiliy simplicity fact easy several devices redundancy
367890,ah probably meant specific app named otpauth bad 
367891,yes meant app
367892,1password even better
367893,also already yubikey supports totp auth top yubiotp u2f pgp blah blah
367894,add existing totpgoogle authenticatoretc codes yubikey generate totp codes without totp secrets leave yubikey
367895,nfc yubikey get codes someone elses' android ios phone
367896,authy pretty shitty app
367898,yeah dont improve lot apps freezes every time open
367899,use separate android device internet access aegis open sourced app good functionality back without emails shit like
367900,2fa codes phone lot apps wrong first place
367901,seems like might've meant lot accounts
367902,hm ok experience freezing tbh many accounts try transfer data authy new device surprise doesnt allow retrieve original code aegis example convenient
367903,smart would always use separate android device password storage pen paper whats go
367904,keypass ofc
367905,current computer
367906,separately stored encrypted usb stick back another usb stick 
367907,making things complicated make loose shit day
367908,thats lost online accounts much complicated opsec
367909,yep happened overcomplicating security find right balance good organization system
367910,would suggest everything create visualization mindmap maybe write stuff security can't really
367911,authy good hacks authy
367912,think would matter default authy 2fa account tokens stored locally
367913,problem default authy allows mobile device access phone number associated authy account download access private keys account somebody uses social engineering access phone could problem change settings
367914,think option disabled
367915,yes said default
367916,install authy iphone android
367917,one goes missing find another phone install
367918,one backup
367919,might need dig better solution though like yubikey idea
367920,really use authy i'm much help others might know better generally sounds good
367921,yea i'm researching yubikey rn
367922,what's best authenticator among
367923,authy convenient carrying yubikey around
367924,im using authy yubikey
367925,authy stupid account yubikey important acc google twitter etc
367926,call overcomplication mentioned pretty simple basic opsec nothing special
367927,think best see list top recommended point sometimes preference also depends secure really want adding separate layers like early mentioned using separate android w internet connection
367930,specific reason people prefer fork compound aave
367931,good day sers anyone knows place look tags wallets btc network example etherscan see tag connecting wallets binance big accounts
367932,idk anyone answer preference would suggest looking top forked protocols compound vs aave find common variables
367933,breadcrumbs
367934,thanks needed
367935,options storing seed phrase aside paper
367936,tbh knowing i'll sooner lose paper back someone hacks icloudgoogle drive
367937,multiple pieces multiple different places helps
367938,anyone opinion storing seed phrase 1password encryption software eg password gated folder flash drive
367939,anything paper impractical
367940,bad idea
367941,like could also put somewhere keep coordinates g drive etc encrypted format
367942,

368062,web based need install anything
368063,see
368064,need install desktop app still alpha version
368065,anyone made siginficant innovation cream finance oracle proxy code obviously old gold wanted know anything done years since
368066,
368070,think upto date version one iron bank 
368071,they're identical 
368073,updated frequently
368074,mean priceoracleproxy files literally identical according diffchecker thanks tho 
368075,sers miss
368076,uniswap polygon
368077,looks like listed price maybe scam token
368078,case index
368080,things anyone looked new kyberswap protocol called elastic looks like univ3 fork sad fancy features like autocompouding full range lp anti jit tier fees% 0008 004 etc lol 
368081,recently stumbled docs lol reads like bad plagiarism
368082,yeap completely makes think haydens thread jit coincidence maybe saw one coming
368083,autocompounding gut imho tho read part docs jit part
368084,adding 0008% pushing race bottom i'd guess increase gas prices tick size
368085,reinvestment curve compoundable constant product curve supports price range 0 infinity reinvestment curve aggregated pool maintain common price behaving differently price ranges pool different amounts liquidity affected exchange activities meanwhile reinvestment curve's liquidity remains ticks increases based accumulating fee swap part pretty weird compounded fees go constant product curve 
368086,they're saying put liquidity accrued fees uni v2 style lp
368087,seriously cool ways could improve basic uni v3 design think actual limit orders guess kyber gave something
368088,auto compounding useful guess really minor gelato
368090,different risks tho sure one id prefer lol
368091,
368092,tdlr one bailed harmony suggesting minting billions one compensating users three years one valued 002 usd time exploit
368093,ie 1k harmony get paid 50k one course three years clarity proposal things certainly bode well harmony
368094,oof
368095,yall think savax valued amount avax backing
368096,isnt risky like valuing gbtc steth backing value different theres shorter unlock
368098,unlike gbtcsteth savax unstaked today thus redeemable gbtc wait regulators steth wait merge future unstaking upgrade
368099,unstaking isnt immediate though affect pricing
368100,anyone know amberdata compares cctx's data sources better exchangevenue coverage what's frequency entirely clear exchange data supported cctx documentation 
368101,sure savax pool implements technically split stake rolling unstake periods least redeemed time minimize risk maybe think unstaking queue clue price risk though
368102,thinking either increasing cdr match pricing risk using custom oracle price depegging safe way
368105,another point consider compounding fees expose il

368147,f accidentally asked client send money usdt contract sent 10k anyway get money back lost forever
368149,guess could reissue original account tokens
368150,
368151,lol sort stuff always makes wonder wallets give warning
368152,unironically contact tether support
368154,using ledger make unlock get address super annoying instead went back previous tx copied address
368155,address copied smart contract
368156,use ens next time
368157,oh damn usdt id chance even worse asked usdc sent usdt smart contract f
368158,ya stopped using ens one owned years ago expired get def one 
368159,thats unfortunate
368160,oh crap still withdrawal function contract believe
368161,usdc usdc would salvagable f
368162,wait can't prove usdc lost funds way give underlying usd
368163,mean sort stuff possible
368164,since recoverable
368167,contact usdt support they'll likely return less week
368168,usdc usdc they'll refund usdt random contract refund 10% fee usdc random contract refund accidentally got sent usdc tether erc20 contract 
368170,dai 
368171,hmmm usdt contract rescue feature
368172,
368173,that's usdc contract think usdt contract
368174,ahh getting confused 
368178,even happen usdt contract blacklisted
368179,checked see
368180,
368181,ah see thats issue usdc didnt block usdt's contract address
368182,blacklisting blacklisting sending wallet addresses token addresses think find
368183,used dai first place dumb
368184,575k dai contract address 
368185,uncessary violence dude
368186,right doesnt help could blacklist make certain funds cant removed sc make quicker refund
368187,although might get annoying unblacklist contract way upgrade withdraw wish usdt recovery process usdt recovery method token 
368189,i'm afraid reality refund ever need chalk loss using new payment route particularly unknown counterparty unknown competence always sensible small test tx first check everything works expected
368192,ya fault well much back forth client get money sent correct address case guess learnt first time losing money like crypto fucking annoying though
368193,sent circle support email dont expect anything happen though maybe years theyll change policy recover funds
368195,circle thought said usdt
368196,client use ui eg mm always wondered common issue
368197,way around client sent usdc tether contract
368199,guess youre gonna need unpaid work 
368200,hired dev work actually made 0 profit even money come im fucking annoying ill get still
368201,anyone ever create wiki plan creating one advertise teach people main stream data niche thing
368202,wondering guys knowuse mediawiki personal suggestions
368203,ok risk blacklisted reason
368204,leverage end full bags side sure understood correctly
368208,end dai printing dai basically unwraps feeling dumb today could wrong
368209,asked client send usdc usdt smart contract confused coin initially
368211,ranges fixed reinvest
368213,yes maker vaults arrakis resigned admin functions otherwise maker would approved
368215,vault isnt liquidatable due psm
368216,overcollateralized
368219,usdc depegs bigger issues holding dai 
368220,dai already fully fully dependent regulation thats new imho usdc cool devs governance slapped top least collateral could danger ways go around benefit dai usdc cannot blacklist dai address basically collateral dai attackable dai holders add rwa becomes true reality even doomer speculation kinda ps still full admiration makerdao people genuinely
368222,except dai psm usdc
368223,stablecoin
368224,dai already 60% usdc
368226,two popular decentralized stablesoins usdc wrappers deserve
368228,theres argument made dai safer usdc cause 40% backed eth 60% backed circles bank accounts
368232,said liquidatable
368233,psm
368234,absolutely ridiculous claim
368235,read makerdao docs saying nonsense like
368236,lmao turns dragonfly mysterious whale voted lido treasury diversification sell tokens
368237,proof
368238,dragooonfly also big terra investors
368239,
368240, obvious retrospect time perception among us lido team well guys bought tokens open market youre big dictate entire vote course get vote themtheyre governance tokens owning tokens means get voice within dao lesson learned skullandcrossbones
368241,teams would suggest participate votes put skin game open market
368242,got criticized vote proposal end day matter perspectives team making proposal
368244,service gives back blocknumber specific day ethereumblockbydate lib calc taking longsure could build cachebut service already
368245,anyone still inaround paris want grab drink steak boulder dm even make small crypto dinner something roundtable topic
368246, thats one know afaik estimate
368247,countdown wantbut good point etherscan api found want 
368248,mr banned longer docs mention sort concentration first version kyberdmm allows people add liquidity specific price range however approach drawback liquidity providers add liquidity predefined ranges existing pools create new pools high gas cost uniswap v3 later showed concat pools 1 defining concept of ticks tick price equal power 10001 stated still much cut uniswap variable names bit funny docs obviously plagiarized uniswap's sentences read like someone rearranging sections deleting stuff hoping obvious
368249,kyber complete joke even deployed bittorrent chain ffs 
368250,dai's fiatcoins deleted relocated respective vaults issuers pending result court case dai still utility
368252,lol
368253,many things built people dont fear winter tbh people learned respect dump think lot systems redesigned lot resilient
368254,like terra couldve maybe survived limited ust minting 10% less always system destined fail
368255,
368256,doesnt make joke
368257,also often incentives super important companies
368258,yes dmm nothing new version called elastic first pools amplification min max prices ticket based
368259,like opensea survived klaytyn grands super random integration even though nothing klaytyn end 
368261,recently ive developed open source framework creating fair nft mystery box revealing process onchain framework extremely gas efficient 20000x clone xs method wrote article think pretty cool may applications nfts would like share fellow developers tldr create innovative metadata shuffling framework fpe map revealing nft mystery boxes fair gasefficient manner fpe map requires storing one random number onchain regardless size nft collection makes extremely gas efficient 20000x cheaper clone x's method powered encryption algorithm small change random number results drastically different mapping making rarity snipping impossible combination chainlink vrf v2 users able create fair mystery box revealing process without setting custom backend article 
368266,lose plausible deniability see stablecoin wrapper notorious tornado 
368267,well said could say many stablecoin projs
368268,tool converts token total circulating supply graphic showing increasedecrease
368269,create ratio using mc price coingecko given passage time check someone created dune dashboard ur token
368271,stops chainlink force choice surreptitiously implementing blacklist neuter andor break certain dapps reliant
368272,good question
368274,maker chainlink repetutational damage supposed prevent bad stuff happenjng rather code decentralization
368276,new aave stable takes logical conclusion wrap centralized stuff usdc rwa wrapper dai usdc megastable increase resiliency hopefully
368277,nothing still fully trust based cl could pull plug moment trust em dont would economically reputation wise irrational
368278,work force
368279,yeah news tho
368280,even choice seen reputation counts little good enough story
368281,people seem happy using em despite killswitch billions tvl
368282,prevailing narrative chainlink good enough means people really seeking alternatives better worse good enough alternatives exist bad real clunky integrate expensive factor ethereum
368284,doubt
368285,case point dai vs liquity
368286,thats issue seek alternatives theyre easy integrate battle tested nobody really bothers hey cl 
368289,assumes bulletproof reason would use rather bunch intangible stuff guess hope pray happening happens soon enough get real competition 
368290,one way would make contracts immutable would require projects able switch another one need adjust feed addremove nodes etc would require dapps think oracles andor implement ways actively manage would remove multisig thus potential killswitch smoothconvenient enough nobody bothers simply read ethusd without caring actually happens underneath 
368291,one could also try building defi primitives dont require oracles like good old uni
368292,many things require oracle
368293,kinda either situation tho either dapps step actively put work oracles go easy way choose managed service sorry shillwere currently working making types available get immutable data feed need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc get managed service la chainlink read ethusd without caring happens underneath think people go immutable stuff care enough believe majority industry simply gravitate towards whats easier use 
368295,could use chain oracles based amms get bad rep people dont bother implement flash loan guardrails b often much less liquidity honeypot none like insurmountable issues
368296,thanks lets see think gonna people put thought oracles even tho one important parts setup 
368298,maybe things actually build without feel somewhat groundbreaking
368299,assumes want prices tho data types 
368300,stuff doesnt necessarily trade onchain
368301,theres great paper twap oracle attacks easier done said might find interesting 
368302,well need external serversvalidators anyway point cl good
368304,think difference made people running nodes cl multisig rug everything course network diverse bigger names participating doesnt change fact cl multisig point price aggregator somewhere completely else without timelock whatsoever
368305,good long multisig allows 
368307,get immutable data feed need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc mean anything relying cannot immutable
368308,welcome dilemma choose want immutability 
368309,title bit catastrophistic considering criticism kind average used twaps haha think fair paper though bit truism point every attack every blockchain expense vs reward numbers mentioned manipulating 2m pool dont fee low
368310,know there's dilemma much problem implementation really need something like uniswap everything automated human tweaking ux chainlink
368311,like liquity build closed loop never changeable end using cl tellor fall back anything ever happens theyre fucked immutability oracle level means need good ways ensure ability change oracles wont get abused still designed way act ashoc
368312,dont see happening yet
368313,well yeah go back point chain prices want use chainlink send custom queries dont care much aggregation tech
368314,custom queries meaning
368315,send arbitrary http requests network
368316,yeah thats really aggregation tho youre simply using api request 
368317,yeah need control aggregation implement im fine cl handling deets
368318,im far cl defender service people use
368319,aggregate pass value onchain trust tho 
368320,oracle give assurances fetched correct value
368321,beyond cant much
368322,meh debatable yeah tldr coiner wrote 
368323,idk feels like theres spectrum debate chainlink leaning heavily ux basically runs like web2 company making decentralized loses flexibility ux doubt tradeoff avoided
368324,stick oracleizing network provide generalized interface data retrieval 
368325,ocr save gas im pretty sure cl aggregation onchain also polkadot pretty much use nodes retrieve data stuff onchain
368326,thanks create dune dashboard paid
368327,also paper also focuses uni v2 twaps different animal forms including v3
368328,hmm interesting sure alt l1s default seems like pretty easy win get rid chainlink middleman
368329,yeah dont think anyones recommending blindly use uni v2 twap also fun fact latest inverse hack basically caused disregarding onchain prices blindly trusting cl
368330,hm good question polkadot dont think theres anyone used serious capacity yet parachains quite primitive also tbh half stuff barely works stage
368331,also devs lazy dont want implement oracles lol
368333,nvim way
368335,forked aave xdai code base complicated open source front end back either
368337,hey nice see around wanted say i've enjoying reading discussions learning lot 
368340,hey one using fake ivangi account dm take care
368342,yup got
368343,theres one ivan hes stables
368344,want go
368345,stable stable
368346,sorry say 
368347,yep way nice polite 
368348,patriot lmfao dubai 
368349,hey guys know telegram grps find people different projects
368350,start searching twitter usually include tg link use github find filter projects lead socials
368355,gotta help needed
368357,
368358,hey guys trying collect data companies hacked audit anyone kind data collected already could please share
368359,maybe help dashboard lot hacks cant find
368360,thanks
368361,also check defiyield rekt database comprehensive auditor filter 
368363,perfect thanks lot
368366,protocol list exist similar token list protocols eg uniswap token address factory router
368367,usually teams publish addresses deployed contracts somewhere could hit approve look address etherscan trace back factory read contract
368368,would 'indexing' use case
368369,eg search univ3 show addresses
368370,similar token list along lines uniswap token0x logouri v2 factory0x router0x
368371,guess needs collective effort scraping seems dead end wondering someone worked already direction
368372,ah well idk someone kind make list make public one alternative could think scanning defi llama source connectors pasting
368373,might idea i'll look defi lama docs
368374,dont see list smart contracts guess focus specific ones eg factory pools
368375,well must list important pools somewhere calculate tvl
368376,consider uni v2 deployment thousands mostly dead pools
368377,pancake like 200k lol
368378,lot work guess
368379,yeah less interested pools since get factory address
368380,'static' addresses
368381,token lists must collective effort scraping thing needs curated publicy verifiable
368382,ivangbi find best strategy delta neutral farming
368383,could try playing around dune query labelslabels
368384,interesting labels curated dunecommunity
368385,yeah curated big term author mentioned query filter author'dune' get dune labels many that's impossible correct want list biggest one know
368386,also gives factories pools multisigs whatnot requires finer grained querying efforts always possible
368388,

368442,well parents ussr
368443,yes still wrong imho
368444,yeah makes sense think crypto general tends attract anarchists capitalist communist type
368445,maybe turns people anarchists lol
368446,love people virtue nonmoney driven values nice stuff shazam pockets already full safu live
368447,money driven values one way actually align mechanisms right saying governance daos ruled tokens still final form imho still lot work done
368448,sushi's governance ruled arca think ftx bunch also etc etc examples
368449,anyone know team thats building developerfirst dune realtime data apis alerts based queries
368450,hi look create something like etherdrops bot nansen nft alert get realtime event alerts blockchain run node use things like infura websockets help direction would appreciated

368467,sorry adding blabla bu kinda started blabla calling vb communist
368468,yup fair noted
368469,campaigns public goods funding purpose touches one things raw capitalism cant get right due misplaced incentives public goods funding done governments today make decentralized suddenly dont need governments much thats im saying hes anarcho communist basically like orwell
368470,dont think hes like completely rejecting premise capitalism guy born ussr knows well communism doesnt work
368472,oh yeah work equal nothing lol
368473,still anything brang capitalism fall

368501,well incentives lol
368503,doesnt matter op perspective imho stuff deployed ye
368504,stuff reputation deployed unknown forks ye
368505,fine maybe costly thats another q
368506,actually afaik moonbeam gives used direct token grants teams building aligning incentives yadda yadda
368508,terminology lol
368511,apart bitcoin eth dont know ecosystem hasnt done extent
368513,people pay get reputable stuff already users port new players
368514,absolutely fine whats issue

368536,latest frax collateralization metrics
368537,think previous attempts summed use crypto ponzis save planet haha
368538,personally think idea legs fundamentally there's demand there's problem opaqueness lack liquidity offchain market amms alleviate problem obstacle educating main demand drivers mostly corporates using amms creating market trusted middlemen think right main demand drivers defi degens could change time service providers
368541,nice way raise capital carbon capture projects

368565,guess sovsignal probably something topic compilation well
368566,nothing compendium around topic link resource aggregated pitch decks found 
368568,thank much maybe also communities project vc interaction format mean young projects looking investments right
368570,
368571,pod xmons dropped
368572,sudoswap pretty cool
368573,speaking sudoswap we're hosting first nft financialization hackathon couple weeks bounties nftfi nft bank decentral games ronin network ping interested getting involved rtshares dev communities welcome 
368574,looking chat vcs smaller investors
368575,there's definetely discordtelegram groups paid promote young projects may vc backed funding overall find genuine group paid promotion tricky probably private groups
368577,hey guys friend mine believes found bug uniswap
368578,here's link 
368579,would appreciate anyone smarter check thanks
368580,havent read depth regards fixing uniswap contracts immutable easy lift
368582,frontend bug
368583, bro accumulated 10 dollars worth
368584,say critical stretch far
368585,eth pairs erc20 true
368587,104 doesnt warn insufficient liquidity 
368588,assumed exaggeration
368589,true making similar infra common pitfall
368590,blz 1m bounty ser
368591,bug yes build multicall transactions weird add refundeth tx bug solidity code whatever missusage architecture
368592,depends scope bug bounty get iin
368593,bad ux tbh
368594,think way uniswap router works nuanced post explains use new auto router sources liquidity various destinations afaik chain
368595,wrong response basically say user warned theyd lose 11 eth
368597,happened
368598,uniswap giga stonewalling
368599,suppose calculation gas savings including refundeth outweigh edge cases losing money tbh sounds like reasonable assumption
368600,sure there's justification refundeth called immediate next swapper
368601,using expert mode skipped price impact warning aparently
368602,definitely feels like bug emotional level haha
368605,sent copy paste response
368606,acknowledgement refund eth spitting like slot machine
368607,twice
368608,believe case op specified needs used lm incentives goes team
368613,mean kyber ton time fix implementing core code i'd guess edit bait take
368614,interesting airdrop swapdrop uniswap user arbitrum tried swap exact amount 1385 eth native asset another token rdnt due inadequate liqudity pool able swap 2537 eth transactions later another unrelated unsuspecting user performing exact output swap entirely different asset receives 113 eth intended initial user
368616,another unrelated user inadvertently receiving 117 eth couple minutes later lottery winner 
368617,flagged team directly thanks farm42 letting know
368619,lilmoonlambox3 memezes security researcher chad lol
368620,bro feel lmaoooo
368621,else youd expect carried dev teams get 100s larp bugs every day someone usually helps filter immunefi known community devs around ecosystem
368622,stonewalling
368623,pretty hilarious
368626,samczsun pretty distasteful response appreciate reaching
368629,broke believing cz's uniswap security bugs woke believing lilmoonlambo's uniswap security bugs
368634,place culture war crypto natives we're idiots matter women men
368636,oh meant like didnt think random person getting eth bug hard get idk others im surely idiot
368643,3m
368644,
368645,legit dumb happens stuff collateralized stables like protocols merge happens
368646,business usual given everyone testing
368647,main network ethpos changes fork ethpow centrzlied issuers cexes must support ignore defi also dubled lol u mean smth different
368648,yeah also 
368649,one hedge take precaution actions w assets ethpos like usdc dai
368650,2nd option fkicng mess 
368651,i've trying find answer months
368652,really preventing anyone forking ethereum pow miners choose continue mining ethpow
368653,nontrivial chance usdt chooses eth1 eth2 insert gif
368654,
368655,burn usdt chain keep fiat collateral balanced
368656,ah going interesting fork
368657,fiatcoins decide fate chain theory gonna quite large scale real world test sooner expected
368658,nfts lol make nfts valueless
368659,little chance nft community lobby pow
368660,ser hapen u douple nfts u shill pow nfts make extra profit
368661,communities
368662,feels like bcashbtc worsemore problematic
368663,nft meant 1 unique digital receipts representing existence unique thing lasts indefinitely onchain eth pow fork would make 2
368664,lot problematic bsc bsv native coin concern eth tokens
368665,nigh unlikely tether nukes half chain balance things fiat grow fork trees sooo start stocking 
368666,there's eth pow hard fork use different chainid right retail users still using eth pos default postmerge
368667,would happen somebody made weth offer merge accept offer eth pow merge zero chance eth pow could cost 2nd copy nft bayc moonbirds whatever
368668,dump eth eth1 free airdrop retail mostly move eth2 wallet rpcs point economic activity die eth 1 less incentive tether nuke business trying save pow
368669,much pay everyone choose pos many people love pow
368670,feel like retail care
368671,doesnt matter right long wallets point pos retail use
368672,yeah feel normal tokens big deal value largely intangible fiatcoins really choose one
368673,usdtc fiatcoin whales pow fetish
368674,likely pow die hard stable coin users would users less centralized stables mim lusd frax dai sort
368676,well one fundamentally dependent fiatcoins change much
368677,tfw marketedasdecentralized stablecoin fiatcoin ingredients split across 2 chains fun prospect
368678,someone mentioned pulsechain got removed chat remember discussion regarding doubling value eth native assets discussed richard hearts pulsechain
368679,sure anybody matters gonna make compromises favor ponzi chain matter much
368682,talking scam gives reach there's nothing technically interesting
368683,pick one side start reissuing later they're centralized chain agnostic
368684,altho make much sense
368685,people said hex x43749871297213'd without
368686,curious see plays
368687,discuss price action one contesting scams make money
368688,fair
368689,dapps side need start blow can't really kick road way
368690,can't also pretend fork magically doubled fiat bank accounts either need choose
368691,yea one side blowing i'm sure u wanna salvage anything
368692,theres gonna lots fun mev learn
368693,good l1 coverage covering l1 dev activity cohort analysis 
368697, vitalik save us forkapocalypse
368698,imho theres tremendous incentive smallish exchangesstablecoins hype eth pow
368699,technically feasible fork eth literally block merge though
368700,lol bancor saying daos requesting reopen deposits anyone knows dao 
368701,i'll share point without getting price talk understand pulsechain state copy eth hence tokens eth duplicated pulse obviously meme think it'll intrinsic value hexicans think
368702,pulsechain pos pow begin copy pulsechain turns pow forked eth yet merge could potential marketing opportunity
368704,pulsechain proof richard heart
368705,lol
368706,proof prada
368707,
368708,thanks

368712,
368713,pos lol
368714,wait uh meant curve dex

368717,guys ever try branch crypto they're going terribly confusing time
368718,boson raised 80m dutch auctions also previously raised vcs recall well
368720,checking one right

368738,lido marketing bizdev rocketpool
368739,could whales institutions staked much eth lido fell marketing gimmicks 
368740,bizdev part networking right early supporters
368741,big part game
368742,best product always win
368743,agree biz dev part product front rocketpool friction lido 
368744,spot good biz dev project early days 
368745,way onchain voting without paying gas might dumb question
368746,wonder available every major protocol forum email login voting onchain login option forum web wallets know 
368750,sign delegate someone else submits onchain
368751,sign delegate gasless can't see delegation onchain tx made
368752,otherwise ur paying gas see blockchain supposed know abt
368753,snapshotx product kinda basically cheap thats question 
368754,yeah that's thought wanted make sure
368755,wow interesting thanks sharing
368756,nathanvdh man questions 
368757,anyone farm optimism what's best strategy stablecoin
368758,velodrome pretty nice
368759,sbts nonexistent concept collection words people decided hype simply lets tie money identity reputation one wallet ok done thats nothing
368760,reputation thing could good advertising certain stuff special audiences example gamefi sbts help collecting data
368761,dont want get old debate wallet identity muh privacy boring
368762,dont need sbts cause look onchain activity history wallet sbts fugazi
368763,negative
368764,sbt2 
368765,sbt issued dapp assign kind reward achievement based internal model however agree concept kinda broken design can't transfer case compromised wallet similar situations really get usecases seems forced far
368766,badge poap
368767,muh give fancy names
368769,wrong reputation attached wallet address 
368770,negative also possible move via turnout biased vote holders
368771,possible move way they're really soulbound
368772,instead attaching whole onchain reputation one wallet across multiple wallet onchain activities one wallet comprise one wallet zero sum game 
368773,yeah non transferable key called sbt else defeats purpose
368774,probably move nftavenue
368775,movable consensus immovables sake recovery
368776,sbts restricted nfts
368777,restricted
368778,ok
368779,nah okay imho continue
368780,meant looking sbts nfts rather chain pops across sectors
368781,chain pops
368782,poaps
368783,untransferable poaps
368784,yep
368785,seem make little sense token types
368786,havent said yet special sbts apart bloody untransferable poaps yet many hype like magical concept bloody muh fugazi naming
368787,like kids get stars work kindergarden
368789,perfect character progression system use case 1
368790,feel make sense defi small flash loans bases past credit history
368791,perfect reputational avatar systems supercharged creator economy use case 2
368792,that's fugazi
368793,makes sense blz rephrase
368794,flash loan reputation
368795,thats fugazi af
368797,low duration loans meant think undercollateralized low duration loans
368798,perfect supercharged creator economy like point advantages technical level
368799,yeah kind
368800,would wanna sell character point oulala make character things movable get upgradeable nfts sbt
368801,yeah everything soulbound gonna economy meant like rpg style items can't transferred natural way implement like transferable items lock transfer function seems like small change create whole branding
368802,soulbound pseudo magical high tech aesthetic basic concept
368803,anyone know good blogs blockchain gaming theses
368804,tbh feel like sbt fans pushing new shiny crap throat dont fancy name unless literally say yes like fancy term totally fine say untransferable nfts like poaps cannot move thats thats tweet tech sbt either
368805,omfg many times share docs talks stop dismissing without giving second thought
368806,frustrating
368807, good overview
368808,read docs legitimately see what's big deal
368809,sure implement something like branding making nfts non transferable groundbreaking technical conceptual leap imho
368810,mean literally sbt name
368811,i've come bunch blockchain gaming theses curious see what's thinking real use case web3 gaming aligning incentives playersspectatorsdevsinvestorsstreamerspros roblox warcraftlike platforms user generated content skirting regulation betting bootstrapping users cold start problem token emissions interoperability defi protocols making gaming assets productive might meme tihnk axiestepnweb3 runescape stuff great
368812,anyone thinks stuff please dm would love talk 1 year creating stealth web3 moba launch beta want meet interested people
368813,people act like sbts nfts nfts fungible tokens far they're literally nfts can't move
368814,ty 
368815,yes true use sbt name vitalik made popular even though sbt2 prod 7 months longer post can't reach people even 100k dropped marketing unless piggyback trends we've found
368816,totally fine btw everyone likes shiny new terms problem larpers try fundraise shill sbt tech something new also said untransferable nfts live months
368817,without sbts possible scenario around ages used magical shiny term doesnt make shit game better bad incentives better scamraise maybe
368818,degenscore good example
368819,think name lame i'd support anyone trying leverage name goes well users signal boosters andor investors
368820,yep 100% agree implemented originally discussed bound wallet done proper nesting becomes something else actually becomes closer actual soulbound wow implemented way vitalik block transfer way mean
368821,thanks good know
368822,actually nice examples docs
368823,thanks helpful 
368824,swader would non transferable nfts able moved onto bitcountry parachain via xcm opens useful properties metaverse
368825,sure new tech port another chain need bit complex contracts architecture trivial
368826,sure port surely omni chain whatever cool kids calling nfts killer feature say nft kusama represents reputation dick cool kusama transfer across ethereum reputation comes obvious example might credit score nft allows lower collaterized rate aave
368827,nfts dont make sense wrapped assets like erc20
368828,id imagine atomic transfer nfts pretty killer feature
368829,yes easy bridgeless transfer also huge selling point super pimped reputational avatar looks good also one stop shop defi chain app read info reliably quickly enough give something like undercollat loan
368830,docs look great ser explore soon
368831,there's project kusama giving people trophies every chain referendum vote people equip onto shelf project read cool looking shelf give perks
368832,anyone think happens nfts get pow eth fork understand defi stables oracles etc etc part stick pos chain dont function nfts different storythe really need liquidity pool much anything exist im sure argument made provenance etc anyways curious thoughts
368833,let know question
368834,dm sure looks like youre building great stuff
368835,guess would minter declare canonical version
368836,centralized stables defi whatever protocols tap like opensea looksrare gem genie sudo go away real ones defi get purists like etc people back days nft people retail understanding behind click interfaces
368837,v1 vs v2 cryptopunks stuff gives insight arguments made saying nfts chains priced native eth pow nfts worth lessalthough see going extent wrapping im using word v loosely bridging pos chain making claims provenance head scratcher see defo debate opportunity v least
368838,ez convince nft ppl pos energy narrative
368839,would disagree stable issuer say coin collateralised cant done extent say chain support project completely different imo
368840,kinda said tho issuers decide
368841,issuer nft
368842,still narrative that's pushed thought fizzled heard
368843,retailnormies got washed one pushing
368844,think early give specific definition precisely soulbound concept somehow related digital reputation primary use case partnered degenscore make continuouslyupdating nfts reflecting onchain achievements find sbtslike projects blog unfortunately following kusama's ecosystem closely forgot mention projects
368845,hmm thought first soulbond nft private key 
368846,we'll we're evm
368847,also ppl wants retailnormies come back new ones join cant wait pos especially work artists something focus quite bit
368848,
368849,point l1 rotation game parody lol
368850,must troll marketing scheme
368851,list meetups sf nyc
368852,agree first take set token nft nontransferrable think required whitepaper
368853,however thinking came interesting idea basically allows permanently mark wallet address
368854,building stablechain we're trying minimize state growth maintain decentralization want limit number accounts state idea 2 kinds accounts persistent non persistent persistent accounts work like normal accounts non persistent accounts receive normally soon send zero account gets destroyed sbts limited pass persistent accounts
368855,guys think good idea nah
368856,makes sense
368857,new chain x reason basically abandoning everything 247 mechanism makes possible
368858,thanks bruno googling
368859,documented docsrmrkapp origin page
368860,excellent thanks
368861,man
368862,got idea reading article stopanddecrypt
368863,
368864,even moreso lido able take large institutional deposits
368865,got thinking regulated version ethereum tries limit state growth
368866,rocketpool stake excess supply supply constrained current amount node operators operators stake token
368867,bizdev really means steth usage
368868,still 247 usage growth types users controlled hope makes sense
368869,
368870,first get users worry nonexistent problems dont
368871,getting users real problem solve problem dont
368872,controlling growth seems weird
368873,dont make new chains
368874,usually best answer
368875,

368896,kinda mixing days i'll keep mum
368899,ne happens everyone else message nothing new one yesterday got purged mistake news yet
368900,completely agree users give network value trying learn mistakes made chains us really value decentralization state size something fixed problem becomes apparent
368901,yeah agree well see chain solves trying
368902,want sell macbook created seed delete everything disk utility reinstall macos safe enough shouldnt sell destroy
368903,pretty sure fine rather destroying macbook better move assets brand new wallet new seed
368904,microwave shit change wallets
368905,applications write zeros memory erase content deleting files usually doesnt actually delete changes small part memory tells os theres file isnt 100% fool proof regions memory get worn time dont get written basically preserve selling machine might well treat private key compromised moving assets new address would likely best 
368906,macos filevaultencryption also turned still compromised delete vol recreate im paranoid general want get closer reality
368907,group one really turned encryption anything dont think nft kingdom
368908,time seed already encrypted applicationlevel filevault adds another layer delete volume good
368909,ayo kek
368910,u delete disk utility startup screen fresh install reinstall theres difference safe
368911,personally instead selling mac id keep offline crypto module buy new one personal
368912,sure though disk encrypted youre slightly better position paranoia would definitely make sense store assets hardware wallet direct manufacturer seed phrase never leave device transactions create hot wallet transfer subset tokens accept bad shit happen
368913,underrated
368914, yeah regarding file vault every time u fresh install macos creates new set keys rendering old set useless anyways
368915,ikr
368916,email tg dodgy sites moon
368922,place discuss game like group something
368924,
368926,ooooh baby
368927,use sushiswap
368929,overwrite data first delete
368932,optioncommandpr reset nvram pram mac using firmware password ignores key combination starts macos recovery case mac hardware
368933,determine protocol contract belongs 
368934,normally i'd look contract deployer trace
368935,lots references dxswap dx dao swprconverter owner one linked
368936,thanks trouble one i'm thinking swapr
368937,ok helps thank
368938,swapr makes sense look erc20 transactions tab owner 
368939,would check contact code first deployer contract name dxswaprouter
368940,yes swapreth made dxdao originally called dxswapeth
368943,etherscan internet
368944,
368945,yep
368946,good wanted make sure wasnt shitty internet
368948, also try otterscan pretty awesome
368949,hey guys anybody point solid reading material stables work w merge
368950,hey thought would share report wrote merge impact capital flows mev miners forks 
368951,nothing stables fundamentally operate change postmerge along every contract currently use affects overall stablecoin market terms positive market outlook different question debate
368954,anyone knows way export wallets created particular seed metamask eg json
368955,way create new wallets without reinstalling metamask
368956,buying new computer
368957,bip39 tool make sure save page run offline better
368958,sure understand
368959,current wallet generate addresses use seedphrase
368960,generate new wallet
368961,mean metamask wallet
368962,import new private key want new generation need change base seed phrase metamask uses yes reinstall
368963,damn
368964,using different browser work
368965,create new profile browser open metamask profile
368967,yep tbh
368968,oh nice hack
368969,talking abt brave vs chrome
368970,didnt think new profile browser
368971,one iancolemandotiobip39 
368972,good nickname
368973,yup
368974,mke sure ad page
368975,almost got rekt
368976,would lost lobs real kek
368977,cheers take look
368978,need automated multiwallet crosschain portfolio tracker
368979,quite ivan move
368980,wonder stables work fork pow can't possibly double amount value holding ethereum assets get duplicated pos merge pow fork guess stables fork probably lose value also interrogation mark regarding oracles work forked net
368981,nothing work unless everything stays pow binary outcome
368982,ivangbi group ever host voice calls
368983,lobsters speak
368986,
368987,u playing around merge
368988,
368989,going continue eth pow
368990,guys know lol
368991,im educated
368992,chinese miners
368993,chinese ethereum aka neo
368994,lot people slovenia mining free extra power solar roof systems edit people equipment surely mine something
368995,think mean factom
369000,export logs
369001,get electricity night
369002,system designed way take much put overall make per day use night
369003,hey ser may ask one well
369004,yeah pretty much way work stablecoin issuer decide chain honor redemptions
369005,stablecoins could work chains simultaneously would 100% eth backed stablecoins imo course would need functioning oracle
369006,lusd 100% eth backed think last checked
369007,yes
369008,impression 110% eth stand corrected
369009,sorry meant haha didnt mean collateral ratio meant type collateral
369011,definitely overcollateralized
369012,eth collateral functioning oracle pow fork lusd could still value
369013,aaah got seemed 
369014,nice nice good find 
369015,hmm wonder worth holding lusd similar stables going merge hopes fork
369016,oracle support pow fork bet
369017,question pow eth would valued 23% pos eth much would lusd worth pow network 23 cents
369018,yeah true unless started similar pricing gave time lusd redemptions collateral value backing would get smoker
369019,even could get something nothing
369020,said nothing change mean like underlying mechanism achieve stability altered well contracts macro outlooks merge well possibility pow fork affect i'm sure debate agree tho yes quite likely assets pow fork chain become worthless esp since exchanges willing prepped accept assets
369021,option military grade erase drive content utility disk
369022,friend faced almost successful attack anyone experienced
369023, case attack new malicious metamasklike browser tab asking check insert recovery phrase double tripple checks action 
369024,attack old people usually experience trying google dapps clicking phishing link
369025,captcha bot nft discord btw
369026,anyway think giga caution avoid attacks keeping mind metamask ask seed phrase one time basically use seed phrase one time new devices
369029,idk okay ask like product questionnaires
369031,late discussion every artpfp nft sold express license license express fork handling rules way rarible nft license 
369034,hi guys want perform analysis nft marketplaces im trying build nft dashboard different stats im struggling find one solid source data transactions mints tell platform action taken im kind new nfts advice would helpful
369035,hi sure
369036,one solid source data literally blockchain think
369037,information marketplace transaction made
369038,way add multiple wallets bundles zapper debank zerion want track 100 wallets would add manually
369039,thats lot wallets
369040,first try detect wallet addresses pertain certain marketplaces gradually adding analytical tool hardest obvious way see bockchain actually stores data unified one interface filters
369044,dune analytics
369045,set query track anything
369048, dune good overall also know dune community project free source income sponsorship etc
369049,kek 
369056,kek2
369058,pro subscriptions
369059,claystack ido coming soon 
369060,deck time
369061,debank yes add manually
369062,anyone used new arbitrum bridge yet can't see claim button anymore bridge back l1
369063,anyone try cross check numbers tweet cryptofeesinfo even possible like look optimism 170k tx yesterday per 13k paid tx fees per cryptofeesinfo tweet says optimism charges 280000 gas batching 3300 per tx use numbers see get close 13k shown website approach simplified i'm asking i'm getting numbers nowhere near reported
369064,seems perhaps bit biased least record unique addresses near also note rainbow bridge 4th largest amongst blockchain bridges 
369065,anyone know dune get's data like labels
369066,dune wizards
369067,token soon tokenize everything blz airdrop community
369068,anyone knows eth merge block height confirmed yet
369069,understood set block height difficulity defined goerli mainnet 
369070,growth metric seems biased unsure driven incentives measured phase messaris recent evm report niche ecosystems moonbeam near protocol serve small subset users yet find productmarket fit less 10000 daily active wallets less 100000 daily transactions near's aurora stands sharpest drop new wallets suggesting historical growth inorganic driven incentives recent average active addresses ethereum 60% alltime high showing high stickiness hand nears aurora retained 1% active addresses alltime high

369107,much centralized yes
369108,supposedly starkex exchanges deversifi dydx non custodial still somewhat decentralized
369109,i'd say uniswap v3 count ranged uni v3 lps limit orders
369110,multicall issues documented
369111,uniswap aware potential issues wrt multicall usage tho isnt related referenced issue worth mentioning 
369112,much centralized that's ban trading network level bad ip onchain though
369113,claimed they'd move everything onchain eoy came cosmos pivot
369114,always blacklist address frontend
369115,yeah claim always sound weird
369116,thank samuel
369117,frontend thing

369187,probably main bridge e assets fine
369188,yes e assets compromised we'd world pain
369189,show two funny screenshots

369201,assets
369202,people buying eth exploit bridge lmao
369203,bridge another chain cases youre exchanging locked assets different bridges
369204,isnt pause bridge yet
369205,sleepy devs
369206,nomad pessimistic bridge
369207,
369208,connext affected
369209,
369210,much drained
369211,lots
369212,
369213,good point
369214,yes afaik connext using nomad assets liquidity network example bridging ethereumevmos
369215,liquidity evmos probably unbacked
369216,xpollinateconnext team nomad 
369217,
369219,ironically evmos pumped 20% people sell synth assets unbacked
369220,trading 18 15 hack
369221,devs vacation maybe
369222,
369223,nomad connext big friends
369224,nomad ui actually advertise connext quicker solution thought shared liquidity
369225,
369226,one send rescued funds back
369227,yep theyre working together
369228,150
369229,keeping safer sending nomad team
369230,julrach
369231,
369232,let ask
369233,wait comms official account imo
369234,able rescue small amount seeing transactions think others lot send back that's i'm asking setup address could send back whatever amount able save
369235,
369236,
369237,bridge already empty
369238,wow
369239,isnt whole point optimistic bridges high latency security reasons
369240,think rari capital exploiter might made
369241,rug took hour nothing done
369242,negative 16
369243,frrr wtf devs sleepy
369244,rich devastating thing happen team sure devs traumatised didnt stop probably couldnt
369245,although sure usdc wasnt frozen guess would wait autopsy
369246,glmr chain paused last tx 52 minutes back friend able anything even though knew exploit
369247,fundraise 22m hard expand team improve quality code
369248,yeah mostly curious happened dumb typo kind bug genius keccak spoofing thingy
369249,compound billion dollar protocol big treasury still got hacked devs probably blame easy raise 22 woe betide
369250,apparently could reuse successful bridging receipts
369251,hey sam long time see
369252,yo your'e penguin glad made transition kek
369253,bounty 1m 150m worth crypto
369254,
369255,pause chain
369256,right hackers jumped seeing exploit
369257,trying find evmos could dump native assets
369258,weeks ago
369260,never released statement bridge related
369261,dot cosmos cant catch break
369262,simply replacing address calldata message get validated could per address lots people jumped
369263,fr
369264,
369265,lets quit speculating leader speaks
369266,sorry see paused period 
369267,tx since 1 hr 2 mins tx going
369268,yeah sure pausing blockchain even accomplishes anything unless youre fine keeping paused week takes sort partially
369269,quite astonishing i'm really new hackers see methods hacker using blockchain
369270,cause funds definitely white hatted question much long takes retrieve
369271,looked couple 'exploit' transactions calldata basically every time except destination address that's probably spread
369272,yeah waiting official nomad address send towards
369273,thanks insight
369274,arjun connext we're fast executionliquidity layer nomad connext currently use nomad rails yet users connext directly affected said mad assets obviously risk routers provide liquidity xchain transactions holding madassets moonbeam milkomeda evmos reached routers approx 75 mins ago let know disable support chains protects folks sending mad assets get native assets another chain however there's nothing done madassets already held routers currently approx 33m
369275,unless plan place big doubt 171m supply 80m borrow moonwellfi
369276,liquidity borked already
369277,yeah unless return enough repeg assets gonna insta dump 0 moment turn blockchain
369278,yeah likely late anyway
369279,whats interesting theyre still producing blocks 0 txs wonder executed
369280,substrate magic guess
369281,moonbeams deal lot borking upgrades think stopping blockchain pretty established drill
369282,think glmr team total much liquid assets moonwell dapp funds gone purposes sorry speculation frustrated
369283,yea stopping blockchains show reliable decentralised uncorrupted oh irony
369284,lolz decentralisation worth 200 guess
369285,ty dont know missed lol
369286,
369287,moonwell could another victim blindly using chainlink tbh get cheap bridge assets supply system counts full price stopping blockchain may least prevented drain native assets
369288,moonwell drained
369289,whole chain operated nomad assets moonbeam pushing everyone choice partner wont go bridges
369290,moonbeam save mess indirectly created forcing projects use nomad assets
369291,bears stressing nomad far strongest economic security model bridge construction however system vulnerable implementation risk
369292,last byte different
369293,forcing projects use nomad assets far better recreating risk something like ronin horizon
369294,well clearly isnt far better
369295,rollups also hacked way
369296,would argue stop building rollups go sidechains small validator sets instead
369297,many different types security risks
369298,get youre saying levering unproven software also obvious risks
369299,contracts audited 1m immunefi security bounty long time adopted moonbeam
369300,everything built space unproven software
369301,aave 89 fig sleeping vuln last year
369302,secure development constricting attackable surface area surface area never zero
369303,nomad protects roninhorizon style attacks root trust compromised also protects large category implementation issues example near rainbowbridge uses optimistic model like nomad stopped potentially massive attack watchers noticed attack disconnected bridge however case attack come transactions went bridge exploit contracts ethereum means watcher model halts system event something goes wrong able utilized
369305,breakglass procedures need standardized defi always failsafe switch
369306,nice service would mev replayer aggressively frontruns tx results stolen money trivial thing im sure itll get tons funding usage
369307,interesting thanks though ive always impression nomad months old given tech complexity wasnt unreasonable think needed time proven
369308,requiredisabled 'disabled' line somewhere pretty much every contract external transactions starts give power ton people break require governance unbreak better someone abuses power halt protocol stuff like happen unabated
369309,already generalised front runners probably front ran attacker's transaction
369310,remeber first transaction lost 350k fees failed transaction
369311,actually thats true better action sneak pause
369312,whole audit 
369313,artcile pvp santiago palladino played white hack pretyy interesting
369314,something explicitly centralized
369315, tldr write another bot try front run attacker dark forest
369316,layerzero precrime likely helps 
369317,
369318,original dark forest post
369319,shortterm perhaps really long ownership power given dao dao choosing agents emergency powers exercise necessary people misbehave dao remove
369320,layer zero using chainlink anywhere calling trustless 100% honest
369321,sense system dependent dao hyperstructure suppose
369322,that's misdirection substance
369323,saying dao control whether contracts work centralization
369324,mean prety dope tech implicit trust assumption oracle relayerregardless whetther colluding
369325,yes
369326,okay different definitions centralization describing hyperstructure granted think even uniswap would fit definition since fee switch
369327,hyperstructure meta hyperstructure shareholders
369328,saying otherwise 
369329,
369330,eth hero
369331,could someone share link ethsecurity tg chat
369332,nomad exploiter
369333,exploited lot addresses one turned whitehat
369334,daos best rehash shares onchain practice much worse name complete misnomer one would unironically call companies shareholders decentralized virtue shareholders yet people space somehow convinced there's magic decentralization juice onchain replica concept
369335,dumb typo 
369336,
369337,well that's fortunate least still believe bridges ticking time bombs
369338,smart contract bug tho seems
369339,whitehat fact
369340,yeah clear actually explicitly initialize zero failed initialize solidity
369341,tech super complex dependencies minimal sig verification
369342,implementation risk custodyeconomic risk
369344,dpos upcoming synapse chain add
369345,sure follow bone contention isnt implementation havnet code apparent mispreprentation
369346,complexity
369347,gather using optimistic verification staking top slashed bad actors
369348,oh agree sorry clear
369349,normal optimistic verification already slashing
369350,synapse model chain acts hub dapps deploy effect makes synapse chain aggregator users deploy synapse chain turn interact chain contrast nomadconnext pointtopoint means devs deploy anywhere dapps interact chain
369351,
369352,
369353,much spin narrative losing 200m
369354,
369355,many teams exploit plandrill general like say building caught fire exit strategy
369356,doesnt hub design one potential chain drained funds synapse chain whilst point point system funds drained chains causing one side assets unbacked
369357,well connext nomad almost use protocol deep partners

369363,axelar controls route 100%
369364,make difference security model there's one chain home given native asset eg eth ethereum
369366,makes sense assuming home chain assets cant exploited
369367,doesnt bork defi moonbeam evmos
369368,tfw hacker read audit
369369,could exploited one chain could exploited another unless i'm missing point
369371,impacted moonbeammoonwell nomad main bridge glmr
369372,tweet incorrect
369373,
369374,stopped transactions maintenance
369375,tfw hacker made audit
369376,claiming samczsun wrong hack worked could explain work
369377,i'm saying fatmanterra's tweet incorrect
369378,attack different similar 100%
369380,root initialized improperly routine upgrade
369382,audit warn would process unintialised root actually initalised set 0x00
369383,except tweet literally discusses cause exploit zerovalued leaf prove function sure cause identical verying leaf bytes320 would prevented exploit
369384,listened quantstamp recommended happened needed requireleaf bytes320 'err' edit wrong ty sam
369385,hmm see coming solidity dont intilaise value set 0
369386,white hat recovered 1m lol
369387,real question deployment config changed
369388,cant say definitively bet lot 1m whitehated
369389,house use custom errors thank much
369390,saw one case verified
369391,1ofm secure expense latency without trading ux security delta 1ofm pos may wide enough justify use cases certainly thats beauty tradeoffs
369392,fine 'er031' refuse use revert looks ugly
369393,that's bug
369395,touch two teams native token recovered going official redistribution plan whitehat tokens shall arrange return funds
369396,think see getting root leaf
369397,nomad exploit
369398,yes proving message hash 0 done much think would impressive found something hashed zero
369399,generate collisions hashing zero please tell create2 hashes zero
369400,kneel 
369401, apparently outside threat model ser
369402,totally different thing
369403,wants deploy contract addy 0
369404,use exploit contracts zero address validation functions like acceptownership etc
369405,case transferfrom oz erc721 implementation
369406,generate zero address rich
369407,would need private key address 0
369408,looks like hacker generated valid msg bridge tx
369409,via create2 simply need salt hash output address obviously still impossible keccak broken would also break nearly ecrecover operations rely hash input onedirectional
369410,todo list monetising testnet eth yes im looking kusama

369412,yep
369413,work getting nomad team
369414,appreciated
369415,power pause glmr
369416,folks whitehatted nomad please get touch julrach cc marcopaladin1
369417,enough liquidity receiving chain yes else use nomad
369418,30 min latency window 48 cycles refresh per day liq means w 50m liquidity 24b daily volume additionally latency slowly creep start running liq easy track redirect liq real time
369419,
369420,thanks arjun arranging certainly appreciated
369421,julrach tbh i'm messenger 
369426,whitehat feel free dm
369428,would nice something public whitehats something would turn hackers whitehats
369429,open suggestions right working creating recovery procedures
369430,going jail already good news whitehat
369431,would cool immunefi created generalized process
369432,collecting funds etc
369433,though quite bit dmg done bad whitehats probably smart incentivize much
369434,interesting find team solve problem 
369436,mostly thinking people money wallets thinking using case public 510% bounty people could instead return claim bounty
369437,cant really hard fork usdc dai wbtc ethereum
369438,sure think let's see team handles
369439,
369440,best luck julrach
369441,whitehats would like return frax fxs eth mainnet back frax protocol feel free dm questions asked 10% total funds recovered instant bounty also documentation reference 10% clean admirable exemplary funds without go tornado hassle 
369442,ever exploration using native usdc conduit create synthetic positions rather bridging example want bridge eth avalanche mint value via circle avalanche creates synthetic eth position avalanche bls remind i'm dumb
369443,frax nomad
369444,frax native moonbeam
369445,thats 10%
369446,circle accept function without kyc similar
369447,upgrade set contract creation
369448,
369449,circle 100% kyc business afaik
369450,i'm using one example
369451,create synth eth position though
369452,would usdc avax point
369453,i'm trying create eth avalanche example without bridging assets
369454,trying use perps
369455,feels like possible
369456,synthetixstyle might pair avax curve help maintain peg sorts
369457,sort i'm thinking
369458,sounds like lending
369459,sort perp
369460,mean get eth exposure usdc indeed using collateral onchain futures straight swapping ethe
369461,guess depends want long eth issue synthetic eth via collateralised usdc vault cases lot platforms exist
369462,could create curve pool spot vs perp maybe
369463,julrach sent long dm list things right know hectic time please go
369464,solves price exposure part solve fractured liquidity part eth eth wanna buy smth avax funds avax avaxnative synth help
369465,lets u get eth ethereum avalanche without bridging
369466,perp also comes lending certain extent funding rate
369467,unless different model mind
369468,straightforwardless risky approach would still something similar stablecoin protocol makerliquity issuing synthetic eth
369469,correct
369470,yeh
369472,could lending protocol provide eth ethereum borrow whatever want remote chain
369473,crosschain messaging possible
369474,could also pure creditbased approach little direct backing mint syneth directly lending protocols offer lower interest rate borrows curve pool peg
369475,issuer would still taking lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc
369476,roughly security model bridge tho
369477,bridges
369478,requires alrdy assets avax understand correctly
369479,yeah starting point avalanche issuance synth assets order avoid bridges
369480, probably bridge risk pairing curve
369481,that's goal use circle conduit
369482,la wbtc
369483,mean objective custodian behind custody eth full instead using usdc
369484,usdc euroc ethc
369485,aave v3
369486,way native assets eth would allow borrow avax instance
369487,
369488,hope ok happened really sad
369489,what's total impact hack amm pairs loosing value solvency lending protocols etc
369490,know feature looks promising
369491,considering relies bridges end different still
369492,btw integrated bridges yes ones scuzi didnt look info
369493,using chainlink
369494,crosschain lendingborrowing
369495,chainlink assets magically chains wdym
369496,assets magically chains
369497,asset x chain borrow asset chain b
369498,chainlink allows tracktransmit data crosschain
369499,might missed happens exploiters consolidate money doxxed addy eg poison dao style ref nomad
369500,actually chainlink allow assets magically chains went ccip prez 
369501,
369503,wasnt asking price feeds thanks coiner
369504,talking price feed
369505,

369515,protocol audited ethereum expand polygonarbitrumetc think get another audit original audit suffice
369516,case seems like audit must done time deploy sc ok default 0 initial root deploy error issue nomad hack case
369517,case way bridge handles tokens gnosis chain aka ex xdai either compound aave fork allowed reentrancy attack smth like basically yes
369518,i'm curious
369519,audits wont save weak opsec
369520,council probably
369521,
369522,
369523,yup thx
369524,hey guys know best way get convex pool addresses automatically
369525,hi everybody best source gathering derivative volumes exchanges 
369526,oh van0k oxmikko make one maybe
369527, 
369528,vikruna 
369531,take gaugeaddress provided pool supply gaugemap contract check booster 
369532,curve
369533,yes pass convex contract see booster
369534,aha cool
369535,indeed
369536,thanks lot
369538,let guess u marketing ur bag
369539,true pissed figuring right audience product found useful delete message
369540,ok watching u sneaky 
369541,protocol need make rumours token they'll get plenty free testing
369542,feel wrong way get core users
369543,agree formal uiux testing needed
369544,generally recommend multiple audit one
369545,thats kind idea thinknig well cool things like eth rank leaderboard contributors might better ideas make working rather make test earn
369546,also lobsterdao hello lol helped test gearbox tremendously cryptotesters rabbithole layer3 smth
369547,lobs cryptotesters
369548,also think working zapper zapier want users get detailed pl sure though might chat understand
369549,boosterpoolinfoi help
369550,specifically pool crerewards field
369551,kind testing really need
369552,think code4rena model interesting
369553,yea best
369554,closer decentralized testing way curated
369555,also helpful communicative
369556,huge fan code4rena model en ppl
369557, performance art
369559,question remains gives moonbeam power halt chain halting simply meant users anything watch money drained
369560,anyway dont let eternal auditing debate distract devops failures bugs like always nobody escape reason dont hear dozens stupid bugs faang introduces code theyre much harder exploit focusing limiting damage much important imho
369561,reaperfarm also hacked multistrat vaults around 2mil gone news yet
369562,
369563,sir teams different connext uses nomad slow liquidity case connext doesnt router providing liquidity sides bridge
369564,ser liquidity shared
369565,announcement made via official channels also get touch julrach nomad please fall victim impostors
369566,implementation faulty may specification hold responsibility maybe vague incomplete list protocols implemented erc4626
369567,subtlety must approved tokens operate
369568,yeah think spec issue newbie mistake ask
369569,erc4626 specification bug
369570,doubt seems like implemented scratch review implementation properly otherwise please let know building erc4626 right 
369571,simple mistake dire consequences validation receiver account accurate allowing anyone withdraw anyone elses funds
369572,guess make sure u validate invalid paths ur testing
369573,ah specific spec usual people testing code i'm building oz implementation anyway
369574,kind weird act like anything erc4626 
369576,nontech implement
369577,40 people we're looking mass event keep mind people preclaiming optimism airdrop well ui public well
369578,oz afaik solmate implementations g2g
369580,never actually checked ownership custom withdrawal function 
369581,least added noreentrant tho lol
369582,damn need learn solidity everyones getting rich hacks 
369583,udemy

369585,encode bootcamps
369586,thanks ill learn try exploit xelements one day
369587,protocol onchain delivery derivatives based fixed rate lending anyone know
369588,try us
369589,tried encode pace way slow
369590,heard nomad forgot proof verification function
369592,lol everyone giga brain especially comes playing code
369593,im gonna try coder lets see align ur opinion haha
369594,looks like ada users also got impacted nomad 
369595,
369596,messari acquired airtable website 
369597, need pay messari get info dove giving free
369598,data
369599,dont think sodata still also hosted 
369600,anyone thoughts crypto price aggregaotr api providers like kaiko amberdata like firms better exchange coverage reliability etc
369601,guys yield strategies stargate
369602,best heard two transactions w high gas acquire entire stg community allocation
369603,anyone good examples apps using erc4626 yield bearing assets creative ways
369604,alameda tokens thats happened 
369605,undervalued
369606,si
369607,moment vestg dashboard ppl gonna late

369614,airdrop vestg 
369617,lol 
369618,well fantom traction really near 0 point extending risks
369619,decision seems super logical
369620,would applied honestly across board
369621,screenshot attached exactly help story fantom one worth risk
369624,also le dapps buttons interesting nice
369625,meh unwarranted hate
369626,though
369627,know need juicy reward like avax aave king
369628,dym would governance able switch modules
369629,msg didnt make sense redacted ser
369630,problem exists entity switch either state
369631,well either adapt grow risks given full stop w governance likes gets trumped new fork w coin
369632,dont see make totallyfinalizedprotocol defi right
369633,already 2
369634,anyway agree biased argument always visible aave core members liked bd aspects avapolygon systems
369635,likely respect dao dao personal relationships assume relationship w fantom thin speculating
369636,
369637,nowadays normalize perpetually unfinalized apps especially sufficient clout
369638,dont grow hard cap tam
369639,uniswap grow
369640,ah well amms rarely adapt tho
369641,curve also final would hate parameter parameter kill switch tbh
369642,mean get ur argument though warranted light
369643,fact they're ones property make problem obvious
369644,arguing per se
369645,pretendao thoroughly useless good thing can't say pretty much anything else claims market
369646,lets say u hate daos pretty much w direct token governance aave particular makes sense
369647,reads
369648,oh definitely i've open lol doubly considering people exists favorite 3 letter agency even fooled anymore last scathing review anything go
369649,ones btw

369658,
369659,many centralized exchanges kaiko cover
369661,sorry many questions wondering ranking crypto trade volume per country
369662,would anyone happen know address bridged 20m moonbeam ethereum nomad week ago sent binance
369663,multichain really shady machine though could lack communication still hard recoup bridge asset vs native asset always bridge polygon using multichain tho bcause cheap aave fudding friends using bridge argument curious much % polygon's tvl multichainoriginated vast majority guess
369664,multichain really shady machine though could lack communication still hard recoup bridge asset vs native asset shady machine opaque opensource afaik bridged assets solution first implemented bridgoooors starting bridging left right bridges left liquidity times giving lot users bad experience
369665,mstr michael saylor steps ceo microstrategy
369666,welp there's second saylor
369667,unrelated
369668,microstrategy reports 918m impairment charge bitcoin holdings q2 link
369669, like special strategy avax founder fud rollups absolutely pointless arguments showing idea works
369670,still 68% voting power actually doesnt really matter ceo
369671,agree move made reason we'll see
369672,dude's bronk issue nomad's theoreticsl design
369673,opaque can't really cross check bridged vs native asset standard chainetherscan dd comm team answer hard questions also info business model provides liquidity profit whitelisted lp still cheapest bridge anywhere afaik moving tech forward v3
369674,19b assets 
369675,thats multichain
369676,thats crosschain interactions ie bridging asset chain b interacting protocol chain b
369677,aware multichain specifically dd stuff regarding lp business model part believe specifically unclear undocumented multichain
369678,ah wait
369679,thought speaking like multichainapproach protocols
369680,idk multichain tho
369681,crosschain thats 2chains
369682,ok im done
369683,
369684,writeup friend mine nomad exploit ultimately came faulty audit 
369685,anyone enterprise level blockchain experience interested learning private blockchains built metaversebusiness strategy applications large companies prepping consulting interview advice would helpful dm thx 
369686,anyone know source
369687,
369688,go
369689,phantom that'd basically end sol go settings trusted apps revoke permissions source known
369690,agree put instruction tweet
369691,cant bias since phantom used wallet since funds moving wallet big probability wallet created phantom looks like well prepared phishing attack honest really familiar solana wallets work
369692,
369693,people reporting slope seem phantom info noisy right
369694,twitter saying solaland
369695,
369696,well first ecosystem hack see ever
369697,anybody contact snapshot
369699,solana phantom wallet please consider moving ledger 
369700,price steady 39
369701,incident update 
369702,scary 
369703,ask anything

369731,
369732,posthog legitimate
369733,
369735,yea fudding
369736,surprised lobsters excited
369737,
369738,waiting day since forever
369739,ivan sleeps still grin
369740,prolly dreaming solana maxis begging job gearbox right
369741,end solana something roll back
369742,solana classic
369743,even private keys leaked whole thing done forever
369744,price started tanking
369745,like that's worse dao exploit can't rollback fix everyone's private keys public
369747,ahahahah
369748,thankfully never happen metamask right
369750,lots uneducated guesses
369752,ivan really sleeping would've happiest moment life
369753,downfall solana
369755,funny ask interesting fact metamask updates automatic
369756,wen samczsun tweet need think cause
369757,5500 users hacked far
369758,everyone please retweet 
369759,paladin shared apeboard identified hacker wallets 5m affected far
369760,seems smoll
369761,there's private key generation compromise least exploiter slow exploiter wallets presently detected severe people claiming
369762,sure client side vuln
369763,claiming
369764,client compromised gtfo move funds offline wallet cex 
369765,add new information thread becomes available real time 
369766,client side touch wallet
369769,great work always ser 
369770,think people touch wallet months claim gotten drained
369771,agree staying general best practice
369772,case seems help
369773,claim made transactions client side vuln worst thing could ask users open wallets
369774,still assets phantom wallet interacted last week last time next 
369775,think solana hackathon mind
369776,yeah case poeple say touch wallet still browser agree
369777,i'll dig bit confirm
369778,htp9mgp8tig923zfy7qf2zzbmumynefrahsp7vsg4wxv 605 cezn7mqp9xoxn2hdyw6fjej73t7qax9rp2zys6hb3ieu 2968 5wwbygqg6bderm2nnnyumqxfcunb68b6kesxbywh1j3n 1142 geeccgj9bezvbvor1njkbcciqxjbxvedhaxdcrbdbmuy 276 total 10436000
369779, hmm
369781,reports friends getting drained move ftx atm
369782,opening app cause get instantly drained least enough time send wallet assets ftx
369783,obviously dumb enough wait see haha
369784,hey friends think algorand one friend building b2b dex tells best performing chain market feel every chain claims sorry bit open ended question really starting zero chain
369785,relax fellow lobsters network mainnet beta within scope whats acceptable still
369786,moving cex ledger gui cli
369787,perfect that's really good know moving ftx temporarily probably best bet apart hiding plain sight funds staked somewhere bet get taken immediately
369788,5wwbygqg6bderm2nnnyumqxfcunb68b6kesxbywh1j3n really active consider exploit wallet
369789,lol
369790,looks like drained 2 hours ago guess legit
369792,also linked exploiter certainly legit
369793,dont think
369794,active literally 2 hours ago massively withdrew money people's wallets
369795,yep also funded wallet accs 
369796,
369797,
369798,
369799,price isnt tanking
369800,problems solano isnt new
369801,seems likely one new password jackers going around doesnt explain mobile users
369802,mobile users seems like either phishing supply chain attack
369803,yeah issue none testimonals fool proof right
369804,crypto anon says browser wallet unaffected guaranteed true yet
369805,old virusphishing would like believe well seems like obvious case
369806,lot people likely store seeds password managers recent jackers targeting
369807,though mobile phishingvirus becomes less likely
369808,maybe quantum computer finally
369809,lol
369810,phishing equal mobiledesktop
369811,oh like insert passphrase phishing lol
369812,feel like method would pretty obvious
369813,twitter anons saying didnt touch wallet months wtf twitter literally pasted passphrase website
369814,certain individuals ethereum losing assets solana
369815,twitter seems like people wallets drained used slope
369816,saw tweets think nobody affected eth though
369817,sauce
369818,
369819,got money honeypot hotwallet keep around scattered seed everywhere still
369820,saw wallet thrown around linked hacker hearsay though
369821,yeah also cheap method spread fud right
369822,drain 10 wallets preseeded
369823,saying shorting perspective pretty simple tactic
369825,
369826,maybe ens wallets drained active long time
369827,good point
369829,hmm
369830,
369831,
369834,price solana going strong community
369835,ridiculous
369836,happens eth
369837,uses cream finance 2022 lol
369838,moment temporarily uploaded private key trust wallet emergency
369839,rip
369840,solana 7k confirmed wallets impacted
369841,shut
369842,unironically
369843,shut
369844,gets worse wouldnt surprised
369845,someone saying current exploit good use case shut
369846,seeing reports 4050 ethereum users might affected could fluke though
369847,true shared exploit group first thought ppl excited 
369848,hit 8k 
369849,lobster anti sol
369850,tracking
369851,
369852,tracks raw sol transfers there's lot token transfers
369853,maybe people getting bit fatigued still time process nomad exploit get conclusion 
369854,lol 
369855,
369856,ugh much fud exist barely liquidity
369857,funny hackers stealing 580m worthless sol token
369858,true degen
369859,like please drain shitty sol eco tokens dont look

369895, 
369896,
369897,well stop tx wallets effectively locking
369898,yeah noticed earlier reshared funny solana shitpost nutz
369899,
369900,hugs solana frens
369901,impressive decentralization nice
369902,inadvertently advertising concentrated enough establish network level blacklist ought good outcomes
369903,mean lets honest sol working best outtimes atleast 1 good thing coming centralized trashy network wouldnt bad
369904,someone somewhere wholeheartly agree 
369906,
369908,posted mins ago
369909,fix solana hack already
369910,rebrand betanet neverending story
369911,lol chain halted
369912,heard package injection attack theory thrown around seems plausible
369913,eth hashrate also similarly concentrated enough small number mining pools blacklist like work nondurable solana transactions become invalid they're included quickly enough eth transactions practically valid perpetuity noncensoring miner eventually include tx
369914,possible malware npm packages solana dependencies js worst ive used
369915,never dull day crypto
369916,luca hack seems likely
369917,attempting equivalent led etc
369918,would
369919,ct thread issue seems like walletsphantom slope mobile solana network
369920,would miners choosing include txs change anything consensus
369921,mean way actually invalidates tx
369923,regardless imagine much theoretically possible game quite simply
369924,suspect noncensoring solana validator produces block within 2min attacker sending transaction actually sees transaction tx go anyway
369925,validator exist
369926,maybe apparently 2k validators though stake power probably concentrated larger validators
369927,yeah hard believe 2k validators agreed already across time zones
369928,think main difference solana validators better coordinated quite sitting solana discord
369929,posting confirm legit 
369930,probably easy get ethermine f2pool hiveon agree things quickly
369931,better coordinated one way describe small enough enable swift coordination sort repeatedly another
369932,bar entry exactly known low intentionally begets sort thing
369933,dump seed third parties kids
369934,always pull beta card
369936,witha high enough fee miner take called flashbotsmev
369937,always
369938,would ironic socials got hacked well lol
369939,provided actively censoring txs doubt though i'd imagine it'd go principles
369940,run farm temporarily take hash pool mine block high mev fee put back pool
369941,pools reject block contains censored tx creates etceth chainsplit
369943,multiple ecosystems
369944,several security firms
369945,back blocked candy machine txes temporarily iptables rule dropped packets candy machine account
369946,lmao
369947,thing would still possible noncensoring validator include tx
369948,said can't find evidence deliberately censoring txes validator chat solana discord seems mentioning entity spamming network purportedly prevent attacker moving funds
369949,lol website also
369950,failed transactions might result solana network congestion classic
369952,possible indeed decentralized network gets weight thing actually happens solana
369953,
369954,seems like
369955,highly doubt they'd able get enough people together start censoring txs short period time either seen long took get solana back last chain halts
369956,even needed something like 80% stake power online
369957,bigger problem counter theory page fact they've able get shut several times
369958,discussion reminded
369959,
369960,
369961,shut mean halt chain
369962,
369964,yes
369965, 
369966,remember instances though previous chain halts due validators overloaded running ram otherwise crashing validators choosing deliberately shut chain
369967,suppose stated way probably right never shut deliberately beg question constitutes deliberate shutdown
369968,choosing turn validators stop validating voluntarily
369969,would also acting best financial interest delegators
369971,correct
369972,except one september 2021

370025,one android user reported well
370026,using phantom android
370027,
370028,know related anyway guys pardon mei want askwhats best trading platform gift cards
370029,want buy gifts cards using crypto
370030,might false positive looks like someone got hackers ip 
370031,
370032,mainly exchange
370033,redeeming
370034,sure joke bfx hackers bitrefill great
370035,thanks
370036,
370037,pretty website
370038,threadoor around looked much taken nomad attacker
370039,also curious fate usdc hacker manage insta supply 3pool
370040,
370041,still wondering orginal thread good links im looking good tools buffer kinda sucks tbh easiest thing need list tweets ordered new followers profile visits
370042,
370043,posted already apparently bots creating clone repo 0 stars impact minimal
370044,thanks asking nomad haha
370045,ah wasnt replying sorry interrupting flow wanna throw
370046,ah fair enough haha
370047,omg use guild pls
370048,
370049,minute one still knows exactly happened consider theories speculation
370050,
370051,whats plausible theory
370052,something something sloped phantom trusted wallet something something ios imported seed current state investigation
370053,eddsa supply chain attack infected package even worse like bad randomness choose whats best
370054,
370055,packaged used wallets would able sniff recovery
370056,minute one knows anything exactly besides observable data chain evidence affected users
370057,yeah saw people speculating ios got debunked pretty quick
370058,seems new importer wallets affected
370059,confirmation wallets used desktop browsers compromised
370060,evidence affected evidence metamask cold wallets hacked thats multisigs
370061,samkazemian dm frax nomad
370062,many ethereum archive node world sources providing info nodes
370064,merge date confirmed
370065,proof happening ethereum addresses specifically supplychain attack sol
370066,
370067,lost wallet pledges users bitcoin collateral centralized exchange
370068,think there's proof regarding eth
370069,post thing goes depth tweet 
370071,mom want bitcoin defi bitcoin defi home defi home basically celsius
370072,jokes aside okay idea legit think inverse perp positions reliable way making stablecoins
370073,different trusting usdt end
370074,novel forsure relying offchain interactions cex stabilize usd representation btc state channels yikes build smart contracts already
370075,bitcoiners think mysterious ways
370076,qq qeustion mint ens domain directly etherscan nft
370077,need stop larping adopt drivechain concept least smart contract sidechains actually decentralized bridges wont
370078,
370079, full thread easy reading
370080,linus' law fallacy 
370081,funny enough bitcoiners could've defi let vitalik build top existing chain
370082,called counter party
370083,
370084,like thing contract pay contract ask called back
370085,keepers enables smart contracts automate key functions eventdriven tasks highly reliable decentralized costefficient manner
370086,whats best keeper
370087, debatable topic sir
370088,thats awesome
370089,openzeplin defender find convenience keepers
370090,wonder someone actually wrote decentralized fund contract runs
370091,possible
370092,contracts can't initiate sign transactions pay gas
370093,design
370095,use keepers brah read line
370096,thats keepers
370097,nobody crazy think itd fun idea sure lol
370098,external nonsmart contract required execute
370099,keepers contracts 'run themselves'
370100,saying possible keepers exist
370101,polkadot there's project building eventdriven parachain technically could ask one call smart contracts blockchain level functionally keepers would work
370102,u could basicly write eth3x fund coin example decentralized
370103,take fees
370104,sort mev baiting botskeepers
370105,actually yeah make poke function pays calls first need fancy contractssetups long enough people know free money opp
370106,that's keepers exist least count dedicated parties know willing pay gas regardless network situation
370107,dont even need third parties tbh ya automating basically possible
370108,yeah original solution used keepers lol auction reward mechanism account gas costs
370109,need 3rdparties though
370110,contracts can't call decide job done create nicelooking single point failure
370111,selfexecuting functions based event would indeed need
370112,anyone call function thats enough
370113,want decentralise pay rewards call sure
370114,automation number points failure separate points ya
370115,'enough' subjective point selfexecuting automated evm level
370116,dont think point though
370117,thought talking contract runs
370118,yes basically
370119,
370120,clearly evm level cant outcome users really matters
370121,course automate parts protocol external callsbots almost everyone
370122,described keepers exist think described exist
370123,idea youre talking 
370124,wrong
370125,function anyone call much exists
370126,entirely different selfexecuting function
370127,promise end user cares automate
370128,we're talking end users
370129,understand evm cant self execute someone run tx weve moved theres debate
370130,ugh would nice understanding happened start weirdness carry
370131,
370133,anyone affected solana exploit
370134,please use ctrlf

370147,reported account 
370148,posting channel name weird
370149,anyone data reorgs looking stuff around evm chains looking proxy finalised transactions
370151,anyone else finding metamask longer allows eth sending wallets optimism set transfer next button never enables
370152,might rpc issue works fine
370153,wtf put changing rpc settings networks pick network gives bs stuff around currency conversion etc
370154,huh thats odd thats
370155,ok go expanded view works extension popup borked
370156,people interested zk stuff 
370159,people rpc issues optimism worked past
370160,transaction go sign create new app choose network optimism name give something want optimism mainnet click view keys able see https link copy link metamask change rpc endpoint url one copied faster public rpc slow right
370161,wen arbi token need another merge narrative coin
370162,deploy contract set address example want contract address start 0xabcd
370163,
370164,someone recommend api extract balances evm blockchains layer 2s i've used moralis support optimism arbitrum
370165,think use create2
370166,ya wonder specifically
370167,need lot iterations figure right salt value
370168,
370169,also wanted ask anyone know good portfolio trackers work across multiple chains 70 addresses i'm trying build automatic multichain portfolio tracker personal use wanna take inspiration obv know zapper debank zerion quite limited
370170, use contract flag
370171,tried using covalent's api
370172,
370173,fuck binance
370174,listed onchain impersonator instructs return funds scammer address
370175,someone contacts binance get taken asap
370176,pinged one friend binance
370177,wonder someone got paid write article since source dodgysounding site
370178,source article gone 
370179,
370180,reference love ens ticker
370181,true scam share reference message
370182,that's scam
370183,see link
370184,binance tweeted shared
370185,fucking amateur hour
370186,correct source truth 
370189,waat
370190,entire article factually incorrect misleading besides pointing white hats towards impersonator even misstating issue caused hack clarify disclosed part quantstamps audit nomad contracts issue identified quantstamp related prove entirely different function hack exploited process 
370191,money wallet already
370192,scamming scammers 
370195,ser
370198,i'm checking contacts

370206,dude fatmanterra important days deliver much news looks like huge group people working
370208,even reliable sauce
370209,
370212,sad news
370213,one account got facts right capitalized hype posting doom info conversation lobsters redacted
370214,friend hacked phantom wallet never interacted slope
370215,
370216,import wallet slope
370217,
370220,insane
370221,
370222,fat man idea hes talking
370223,way true
370224,true ranks dumbest security breach history let's fooled dumb sometimes frequent others imo shows fundamental design flaw crypto wallets mixing ux security earlier today wrote article going deeper problem 
370225,usual
370226,remind protocol sleepy dev exploit
370227,bug protocol bug wallet maintained developers specialized frontend ux that's main idea article wallets complex beasts several responsabilities providing good ux need updated fast deploy experiments etc that's fine ux fine security point view that's key vault extracted different piece software let frontend developers create fancy uxs made mistakes without compromising security
370228,bizarre sol community reacted attack last night banded together attack attackers ddos causing chain break madness
370229,chain break rpc node
370230,oh thanks clarifying
370231,bounty whitehats many people working since come told nomad completely incompetent retrospective knew things properly could salvaged 5060m contract
370232,references statements
370233,drag drop seed correct order thing frontend ni getting around think frontend brain decided log words centralized server
370234,
370235,yes front end everything related management seed phrase private key signature transactions different one much simpler one 10% dependencies that's updated perhaps year developed small hardcore team sleepy devs introduce kinds bugs frontend app that's updated quite often support multichain support nfts swaps fancy feature compromise pks
370236,investigation still ongoing guess
370238,business model separated parts
370239,still investigating ofc tweet kinda funny shared seems obvious
370240,well depend key vault app imo pure open source project funded grants since small team infrequent updates also important stays open source probably versions running different operating systems windows linux ios android frontend wallet relieved custody responsability business model might like based swap fees open source partnerships
370241,like though selling generic ui
370242,
370243,sure legit damn someone left consolelog code malicious
370244,maybe put key vault part hardware device need connect internet
370245,another component important transaction validator decoder might web service free tier responsability component decoding transaction read humans detect scams frontend hacks
370246,grantdriven really hopedriven development sounds unsustainable entirely feels like trying separate password generation verification ui storage might market integrated password managers exist reason
370247,good one would hardware wallet totally support hardware wallets issues 1 widely accessible expensive 2 can't prevent blind signing least small hardware wallets limited trust whatever ui sent software hardware wallet allow copy transaction verify signing flexibility available hardware wallets
370248,gonna need better pitch software hardware wallet though 
370250,crypto key vault support great feature add favorite password manager work crypto wallets like metamask allow plug external custody choice clear defined standard support limited number hardware wallets running machine
370251,haha yes probably external custodysignature better name hardware wallet implementation concept
370252,
370253,wait say external custodied wallet
370254,exact bug led exploit commit 46d145 introduced new logic part audit 
370255,external wallet use metamask ledger hardware wallet custody key external metamask want get debate delegated custody third party let's keep external ui wallet 
370256,
370258,agree original point frontendux security considerations i'm bit lost yo're taking though constant stream adoption makes awareness education pressing matter counter argument pretty uis start coming complex inbetween solutions contradictory names feels like stretch
370259,hi guys anyone interested desci going emphasize new vertical polygondao would like viewsperspectives 
370260,tldr use hardware wallet tell ppl use hardware wallet especially ppl new crypto
370261,
370262,common practice protocols audit code upgrade without getting even peer reviews code law really something new wave crypto devs tagging
370263,precise objective discussion i'm wallet development smart contract dev constantly feel industry suffering pain bad design decision crypto wallets think user experience bad let describe possible user journey 1 user installs metamask clicks create account new option external custody app recommended tries communicate localhost7979wallets address local key vaults port closed recomends installing app safukeyvaultorg 2 user installs safukeyvault windows browser extension creates account user flow similar current one metamask recommends extra security saving pk encrypted usb stick instead hard disk 3 metamask detects local key vault adds account 4 user interacts dapp confirmation metamask sees message safukeyvault received tx localhost identified 'metamask' accept yes yes tx next 10 minutes verify tx external tx decodervalidator website 5 metamask receives signed tx never access actual pk user wants try new fancy wallet designed cool ux guys fine safe app never access keys
370264,https stands secure sarcasm
370265,that's hot wallet steps moving parts spend long time reinventing crypto wallet wheel tell ppl use hardware wallets know enough adventurous
370266,ledger trezor
370267,im curious card one still europe
370268,eh
370269,think hardware wallets rigid limited unflexible provide false sensation safety prevent issues like one average hardware wallet 
370270,friend mine btc wallet required bust resistor smth similar unlock private key built resist decades hundreds years thing impressed
370271,jesus christ thats dedication hacking someone specific tbh target size neck someone gonna hack regardless takes pdf average
370272,
370273,that's example scams everywhere hardware wallets limited prevent problem blind signing
370274,bit whataboutism ok solution perfect yet average user hardware wallet today safest thing promote
370275,400 dorrahs whaaaa wow nice design tho
370276,mostly agree today tools hardware wallet way go time running metamask virtual machine isolated daytoday use today tools right ones can't keep blaming people making mistakes much better design right tools
370277,yup sure example point guardians social recovery la argent interesting progressive solution personally trust friends iono even vitalik back
370278,check data metamask tx signing 
370279,metamask dependency injection hack shows something ui safe transaction sends different one wallet yes compare hundreds hexadecimal numbers often
370282,agree technically savvy disciplined every time get targeted like bound slip eventually
370283,assumption host machine compromised user double check output hardware wallet design whatever want wont work assuming want single entity remain sole custodian wallet
370284,yes right 1 design allows key vault ux wallet running different devices change localhost something else 2 key vault component much simpler average wallet thus much less vectors attack i'm expert running outside browser also protects attacks 3 assuming key vault compromised blind signing prevented running human decodingverification tx third party service
370285,ask someone please could send private invite ethsecurity thanks
370286,
370287,
370288,hot meme potential lol
370289,someone explain exactly wallet send private keys server way encrypted plain defacto stealing armchair lawyers consultation required
370290,cloud backup probably
370291,
370292,read happen merge terms assets migration
370293,done automatically
370294,would migration since eth2 would chain different consensus mechanism underneath
370295,oh ok thanks
370296,theyre using sentry analytics logging errors seems unnecessarily intentionally adding new user to logging api endpoint taken last night
370297,sentry like many logging monitoring frameworks strong destructuring
370298,either way excuse huge nono problems solved years ago web2 blatant web3 basic application security audits logging output clearly ignored
370299,yes sentry grabs environment variables saves tell sentry send specific data one line code dont understand one would honest
370300,adding new user analytics literally stealing private key web3 logging deserved wallet need collect kind analytics log much spend thought send crash report enough privacy reasons
370301,hanlons razor probably intern set logging
370303,buy
370304,sentry's page
370305,write sentry error report new user event accident even intern
370306,saying justified bad practice log anything sensitive user especially something like sentry
370307,poor form
370308,could also backend crash visible user bug something could mistake tbh definetely ignorant user security since send sentry event containing mnemonic private key one would need store env variables dont really know wallets made assume need actually store mnemonic plain text exclude sending sentry offer option
370309,buy one things farfetched world mistake well closedsource help anyone else verifying 
370310,post postmortem doc google doc link
370311,error sentry application root cause iirc anything processes private keys meant sandboxed
370312,creating mobile wallet one things careful example instabug user bug report takes screenshot shows steps user entered screenshot may seed phrase needs extra care
370313,long ago even google analytics dapp punished decentralization gods
370314,application sentrys fault supposed key term seems rush develop gain market share first mobile wallet sol still auto approvals
370315,sentry less minefield unless emit private key seed errors usually log data provide
370316,sentry selfhosted though usually decentralization finest
370317,problem isnt hosted data collected
370318,yeah sending private key sentry definitely needed
370319,slope sus beginning
370320,yep like said cutting corners beat phantom's engineering team money mobile
370321,
370323,securing sidechains miners sucks tho
370324,stops thing happening metamask though
370325,hard youre starting mobile first cut corners storing private keys seeds local storage pretty easy build flutter apps days
370326,jokes aside anatoly really something else guy never sleeps always responding replies legend ask
370327,speaking sentry metamask dependency 
370328,looks like sentry sends consolelog collection
370329,devmaybe left consolelogwallet wallet obj included private key
370330,roflmao
370331,seriously
370332,deeper look screenshot
370333,
370334,private key navigation part
370335,means moving one screen another sentry log props pass next screen
370336,slope passing wallet object next screen includes private key navigation event logged
370337,omfg supposed handle key material isolate enclavebehind api access via domainseparated sig requests
370338,hope wallet software learn something supporting passphrase etc shit
370339,hi ive mostly quietly lurking wanted say appreciate help far small progress update put

370377,
370378,vitalik front run everybody zkevm article
370379,anyway 0 chances understand
370380,ye sharing even opening stuff
370381,one cares
370382,right
370383,think need ai dumb stuff
370384,also tweets 
370385,anyone share research pls 
370386,zkevm article complicated lot articles
370387,would great added dumbing ai widget pages lol
370388, big bois stock
370390,hetzner ptsd though
370392,i've hosting since 2009 support always stellar cases drives died network outages overall offline times 13 years dedicated root servers currently vpcs colocated frankfurt iirc
370393,issue hetzner shit peering bunch places
370394,get nft og customer lol listening hetzner
370395,disk failures years really didnt like running nodes machines funny email thread keeping server hostage dont setup way want im also difficult customer yeah take grains salt
370396,slope wallet provider saved user seed phrases plain text solana security researchers find link
370397,never issue multiple dedicated servers running around clock 3 years
370398,theyre free pursue whatever consensus want point also imho economic equality effects early pow underrated would fun explore return roots
370399,people see bitcoin inherently connected chain often miss bitcoin could survive asset settled somewhere else point pow would distribution mechanism
370400,bad
370401,tools desmos dahsboard simulate much certain asset would get provided liquidity uni v3 ie start usdc eth tight 10% spread spot price eth rips 20% much usdc would end
370402, i've used past
370403,people could existence yeah sure youd pick btc eth although dont see either market clearly disagrees
370404,think gamified quasi pow would pretty cool pos leads wealth accumulation long run entire world economy ofc
370405,culture around btc makes better sov
370406,
370407,win

370412,ex marine detected
370413,assuming 10% spread eth goes 20% allocation 100% usdc eth goes 20% allocation 100% eth

370416,
370418,sry guys pls drop link compare l1s activitytxstlv
370420,
370421,oh thx
370424,usdc exist bsc many evm chains 
370425,maybe binance want compete busd
370426,
370427,think that's native usdc
370428,usdc binance exchange custodies
370429,wasnt question
370432,likely binance busd
370433,last time checked bsc native usdt either called something weird like bsc usd
370434,better limit order system 1inch matcha
370435,safe use liquidity stable right
370436,neither limit order systems fact 1inch always used 0x protocol iquidity limit orders least last year unless anton devs already updated cc k06aa
370437,bsc validators generally defined safe nothing safe bsc especially thread think see can't recommend storing large amounts assets
370438,reset computer maximum sure nothing ever pulled theremilitary grade
370439,
370440,uniswap going back centralized version
370441,cz coming reading
370443,still second largest tvl defi tho crazy guess fact centralized actually makes attractive
370444,tbf better current state
370445,entire org dedicated helping uniswap independent devs probably good idea
370446,imho usual playbook cannot sunset say stopped working altogether nobody gonna believe say new unrelated entity started main one least full legal scrutiny main workers anymore style totally makes sense fine
370447,given identified phishing attack contract within univ3 contract b fell nomadexploitereth pysops track record stellar wrt security size obviously size still 
370448,see latest articles officerciamirrorxyz especially cia agents guide steganography fooling kgb protecting crypto assets view onopsec prism time someone overheard important think attack vectors even seem unlikely happen macos ios crypto opsec hackers may steal ethers ethsign function matter store crypto securely tips ciaofficer 2 violent attack vectors crypto detailed review opsec crypto thoughts see threat modeling may apply life anonymity see anonymousplanetngorg general suggest using 23 pc system back office pcfront office pc based pseudoairgap see airgapcomputercom airgapit course check security guide 25 rules also recommended speaking antiviruses use want install good one recommend malwarebytes
370449,yea meant limit orders sense matching orders call limit orders also matcha also uses 0x hood
370450,thank much
370451,cannot sunset say stopped working altogether nobody gonna believe though
370452,continue working course need work happen another entity conceptually legally one point attack substance somewhere else
370453,ah want continue working guess makes sense wondering lite fetish bureaucracy busywork
370454,would assume move new playbook actually fake part development indeed come different entities ethereum style early days legit move hard one execute since fake move u need smart capable trusted people lead first movements
370455,lol alternate view 
370456,14m budget give away 60m seems bit high
370457,people nansen group anyone please tag
370458,i've spoken devin author proposal past think related venture side investments they're going pretty hard uniswap tooling i'm sure understand need another entity outside uniswap labs guess uniswap foundation focuses tooling periphery products built apart core product whereas labs focuses core product
370459,lol yeah first thought much money lying around gives people ideas 
370460,deranzxc person
370461,ceo
370462,foundation non profit labs profit guess
370463,decentralise single company behind may easier pay dividends eventually
370464,also lol
370465,al takes make sense
370466,likely true negative
370467,anyone've seen good quality depth researchescomparison different nft marketplaces
370468,honestly wouldnt mind uni got gary'd point
370469,would get 
370470,im sure fine cuz a16zparadigm bags gov theatrics p centralizedorganizedbrazen things considered
370471,daos make everything public election thought good idea 
370472,many projects deserving gary'ing uniswap
370473,what's gary'd
370474,entertaining theatrics least external functionality app there's great deal leverage gary can't say many others
370475,specifically
370476,think diff scale crazy former employee community member getting free pass 75m dao funds
370477,sec'd
370478,lmao ty
370479,genslerd
370480,roadmap pretty funny first let's nuanced discussion coming 
370481,interested overall features users creators also tech stack analysis storage systems types tokens available minting
370482,yep developed something much agile gas optimized 
370483,selectively blacklisting tokens frontend entity within uni makes decisions
370484,btw recently 1inch limit order protocol reached 40% market share volume among limit order protocols 
370485,seen related proposal go governance
370487,gas comparisons found article 
370488,believe whoever owns domain replica interface wo blocks seen ipfs
370489,bad ui within purview whoever builds nobody governance votes css
370490,gary v turns vee friend
370491,case uniswap 
370492,uniswap labs u wanna explicit
370493,tech stack ethereum solana chain storage creators decide store frontend backend whatever choose use
370494,yes could make alt ui comment potential garying blacklist contract someone gets scammed contract b victims b could make case act best interestwere complicit argument holds demonstrated abilitywill blacklist contract first place
370495,youll find lot comparisons search looksrare vs opensea x2y2 vs magic eden vs products evolve quite rapidly apart opensea
370496,well worst thing happen forcing shut domain la piracy means nothing substance contracts
370497,fair governance concern things onchain
370498,recent proposal would suggest
370499,asking i'd prefer
370500,response really think blacklisting goes beyond css despite implemented contract seems like kind thing voted even discussed implemented
370501,probably right
370502,heh giving room sort micromanagement ui sounds like great way make someone lose mind
370503, cc farm42
370504,besides dao thinks almost certainly irrelevant matter they're ones staring fine andor cell face best commission different canonical ui
370505,said turning snitchiswap worse blacklist 
370506,uniswap uses list blockchain sec group something
370507,thedao token contract example banned trading
370508,actually somewhat difficult trade lel
370509,maybe preemptively shut ui let le community figure 
370510,really though even use browser based ui
370511,use terminal client
370512,
370513,build amazing tui
370514,cryptokitties dont render text
370515,would much simpler
370516,guess see ui issue deciding whether start censoring projects surely implications ethos defi protocol single dev right make decision like even possible legal implications
370517,well technically nothing stopping community building deploying dao probably could vote shutting 'official ui' uniswaporg favor community run frontend said voting power hands insiders likely initiative gain support
370518,lol true true
370519,terrifyingly warped definition simple lol
370521,deciding whether start censoring projects surely implications ethos defi protocol yes single dev right make decision like ui yes they're ones bear brunt gary'ing people voting comfort homes 
370524,gary friends going nuanced discussion many people voted defy heh anything happen people going forget dev best month risk reward warped
370526,studied blog say formatting 0 operating system
370527,aws still expensive google cloud u want mmorpg stuff myth 5 years ago
370528,infura pick aws
370529,infura mmorpg
370530,companies use aws way raw price goes decision choose default solution aws
370531,ppl move aave tokens optimism
370532,buy opti dexes
370533,liquidity seems like opti bridge
370534,hmm guess wait team provide lp
370535,
370536,there's also bridging aggregators btw
370537,stuff like bungee probably others
370538,samczsun dm
370539,man responsible defi's security surely relevant stakeholders say
370540,dont want make issue public needs uniswap bug
370541,lied

370545,problem tha doesnt solve anything
370546,frontend doesnt censor contracts

370585,miners voting creates sort fork
370586,yeah different type miner
370587,would harder attacker fork
370588,pow coin eth contract predicated underlying chain progressing
370589,case miners mine blocks trying mine blocks make sure include pow coin progression stuff
370590,yeah making another chain
370591,mining coin rare
370592,miners control underlying chain progression would anyone care abt vote
370593,cuz honest thats need
370594,wont mine evil branch
370595,would miners chain care people playing gimmicky token
370596,miners wont care users might care check token contract mining power little lately attacked
370597,hmm one

371018,vasiliy summarizing sides
371019,
371020,aaaand moving thanks fin 
371023,hi someone explain get leverage using lending protocols
371025,either arb leverage means loan borrow recursively asset type like dai 5% deposit apy usdc 3% borrow apy deposit dai borrow usdc swap usdc dai deposit dai every step size becomes smaller overall aggregate position larger basically arbitraging endogenous supply rates within protocol done lot recently stetheth aave example arbing rates enter leveraged position putting eth borrowing dai buying eth dai putting dai back enter leveraged long usually inferior perp offerings days anyway indexcoop used token leveraged positions long time yet far dpi defi index kicked use gearbox eyes able getting yields exogenously aka use protocols leverage time 
371026, sacrificing lobster shill
371027,go long get coin supply aavecompound borrow usd swap coin supply aavecompound 56 times reach max 3x leverage less go short get usd supply aavecompound borrow coin want short sell usd supply usd aavecompound borrow coins sell supply etc use gearbox faster ivangbi tell
371029,thanks would work terms ethpow trade concept
371030,issue trade concept likely alpha easiest way go put stable btc compoundaaveetc borrow eth keep wait ethalik fork issue likely second fork people sell eth quite likely position would go would underwater asset hands even sell extra eth fork cause main chain still need return stable
371031,likely try go asset tightly correlated eth eth drops collateral drops
371032,going stable risky going semishitcoin major enough less risky maybe idk
371033,please everyone correct whatever missed
371034,dont sell eth youre short
371035,literally fking retarded
371036,would happen collat insta worth 0 fork chain get liquidated get keep forked eth anyway
371037,ye free trade unlikely youll get anything idk thats trading aspect dont kingdom aka pinned
371038,actually good question dont immediate answer happens chainlink price feeds aavecomp react know chainlink stop publishing fork chain protocols read last price forever
371039,thats true mev bots definitely buy cheap unpegged usd supply clear protocol ethw
371041,chainlink said support fork
371042,believe protocol read last price forever unless protocol make shenanigans chainlink otherwise
371043,protocols stop reading heartbeat period passed pretty sure aave checks liveliness data eg btceth mainnet 1h theoretically timeframe theoretically fallback oracles aave maintained v1 v2 per documentation v3 also seem fallbacks anymore pointed 0x0 roughly 3 months ago
371044,doesnt matter tho liquidity poloniex scamchanges justin approve deposits first dump shit done right
371045,simply buy eth wouldnt much simpler would still get eth fork essence would ethpow ethpos retarded btw
371046,yes thats trivial
371047,1h plenty clear mev fuckery watch
371048,kinda depends last update pairs 
371049,yeah youd borrow eth trick want zero price exposure meantime
371050,btceth updated last 55 minutes ago merge happens theoretically 5 mins value accepted anymore
371051,multiply money supply usdc borrow eth since eth pos keep 1x usdc 08 eth ethpow get 08 ethpow 0802 less eth yeah big upside still
371052,wouldnt still exposed liquidation prospect
371053,happens mev flashbots likely wouldnt support miners left first first searchers
371054,likely ye cynical trade dump free money plebs
371055,could yeah unlikely happen always return eth youre getting close liquidation
371056,old fashioned way gas wars guess
371057,u getting close tho
371058,im still confused mean zero price exposure
371059,eth pumps hard meanwhile dont lose money still eth protocol doesnt know
371060,basically eth dont care price need give back x eth x eth wallet times
371061,would relevat though
371062,mean merge theres pump shenanigans
371063,sorry relevant still slow
371064,
371065,guy asked happens get liquidated borrow eth dont sell protocol sees eth going price eating collateral reality since still eth always return lose money
371066,smol dont understand alfa isnt buy hold eth get ethpow instead complicated borrowing operations pls explain simply retard
371067,returning eth defeats whole purpose
371068,heres alfa smol brain talk ethpow brain shrink
371069,bear afraid eth dumps merge wanna get free fork money anyway borrow thing eth without caring dumps
371070,reopen position less ethmore usd collateral
371071,position hedge eth dumping post merge meanwhile getting free ethpow
371072,hedge kinda play
371073, protocol sees eth going price eating collateral whats referring
371074,get liquidated
371075,yeah hedge eth also use trick join shitcoin farms
371076,
371077,ethereum
371078,everywhere time theres token farm also borrow
371079,protocol doesnt know still eth wallet treats normal eth short
371080,youre referring merge play yeah eth side fork chain position prob get insta liquidated cause usdfork worth 0 lose hedge keep ethw
371081,yes u correct shvandrew ps ha yes yes
371082,could explain im clear
371083,depends collateral might worth less
371084,also functioning oracles
371085,think youre thinking going long eth ie supply protocol supply stables borrow eth cant get liquidated dumps gucci
371086,prob better stop else ivan gets angry price talk
371087,ye lets continue make money kingdom enough
371089,anyone know reliable web3 project placing bets esports crypto ofc

371091,that's great looked stake 1xbit1
371092,still web12

371096,surprised theres prominent one already
371097,launching back esports web3 moba game releasing
371098,attempts they're either illegal regulated obscurity
371099,interesting would love chat anyone thinking decentralized betting markets particularly within esports dm
371100,happened augurpolymarket etc
371101,funny 100x leverage pancakeswap there's binary options can't bet

371127,
371128,hilarious
371134,shook randomly stumbled upon original video youtube earlier today seeing ct one confused guess simulation confirmed
371136, buy bags
371137,whole eth pow vs pos drama im curious immutable stable like liquidity handle theres fork itll exist twice liquidity uses eth collateral theoretically could fork entire tvl exist twice im guessing would massive liquidations chain thats real eth since price would probably dump
371138,dai seems even complex since multi collateral lot centralized worthless chain
371139,could interesting opportunity liquidity actually could become stable chain unwinds somewhat gracefully would default support day 1 assume
371140,updated numbers
371141,oh wait according crunchbase cool
371142,likely lower would assume least 50% quoted sum correct
371143,liquity they're using chainlink tellor oracles chainlink says they're supporting ethereum forks tellor thing liquidations happen
371144,yeah deployed lot capital h1 2022 think number something close 20b
371145,great point didnt even think oracle implications would happen liquidity pow neither oracle supports know contracts immutable im assuming theres way add different one liquidity oracles break
371146,interesting chain link usdc usdt 3 centralized entities effectively end making decision eth chain stay functional wont nuke hard due freezing oracles liquidity
371147,uses last known good price
371148,even change chainid best anyone would relay oracle update txes eth price forks think
371149,well thats somewhat worrisome assuming care pow eth
371150,guess use justin sun's algostable
371151,narrator nobody cares pow eth
371152,oh much care sense think itll absolutely fascinating case study happens usdc usdt suddenly cease work backed interesting see liquidity reacts fast price nukes good know theres ever large scale black swan event centralized stable
371153,anything learned
371154,
371155,protect checking uncle blocks
371156,tx routed check prev block uncle hash undefined pow eth
371157,post merge uncles wont able result
371158,blocks corresponding uncle blocks
371159,nope
371160,even something get inside evm
371161,maybe check difficulty even foolproof

371166,anything fork money related found via ctrlf went already probably
371167,aliased new randao opcode
371168,yeah hence foolproof
371169,hi lobsters go securing private keys blockchain nodes devops security systems crypto projects separate servers setup exposing sensitive private keys say new employees
371170,smth worry 
371171,heard euler got exploited sure confirmed tho
371172,oh that's bad ser got source
371173,deposited 15 weth collateral borrow 31000 ctx withdrew weth collateral againaddress funded tornado cash eth selling ctx also going straight tornado cash
371174,original post etherscan link
371175,still looking looks like euler finance got exploited address 
371177,31k ctx sold 47 eth
371178,isolated ctx holders
371179,looks like oracle manipulation
371180,yep isolated ctx lenders
371181,yeah uni v3 lp oracle
371182,oracle rating ranks 'high' risk manipulation shows would cost 10 move price 20%
371187,
371188,euler gang got
371189,fade bro michael life
371190,afai remember ctx deposit playing gauge right
371191,wonder there's history
371192,checked
371193,yeah thinking maybe lender trying play gauge got careless
371194,possible considering going direction far evidence two impacted depositors seems
371195,
371196,yea nuking online presence
371197,
371198,mystery
371200,
371205,cefi version rug pull
371206,tbf think best example euler working intended sad users aware risks associated pair low quality oracle
371207,isnt rari
371208,
371209,fuse would impacted pool whole
371210,impacted ctx
371211,took loan ctx ctx worth 000000000001 never repaid
371212,market checked univ3 twap correct pricing indeed 000000000001
371213,lending markets like compound rari's fuse aave introduce bad collateral drain whole protocol that's tokengated via governance euler anyone add isolated pair oracle easily manipulable get exploited losses contained within pair alone
371214,every pool diffrent
371215,aave v3 isolated pairs also afaik
371216,segregation isolation ofc spillage shorter
371217,platforms fault product offering make longtail usable
371218,yeah also euler inform oracle risk much better terms ux
371219,also adding longtail 100k usd volume doesnt make much sense dao take risk
371220,neither fault speculating adoptioooon
371221,pools like tetra's one attract lot capital
371222,likely pool 150k
371223,several lending pairs used euler one else currently supporting
371224,yeah token gated governance right
371226,euler labs working something open lot possibilities like tetra's old pool developing new oracle yer think case showed euler working intended unfortunate oracle rating tools used actively one would hope
371227,usual question even long tail
371228,add 1000x risk make 10 dollars revenue
371229,cool tool tho sure arguing
371230,idk feel makes sense markets rely economic activity rather biases towards permissionless vs governance gated
371231,euler model works fuse work due governance gating less sophisticated players
371232,ctx guy posted euler discord
371235,also wasnt euler working daos add pol univ3 harden uni oracles wonderland
371236,yes cool idea
371237,point 'longtail' euler's target market design philosophy building secure permissionless systems protocols especially compound rely devsgovernance knowing markets safely activated study tokens properly bad things happen hence majority compound forks rekt reentrant tokens always found way confound devs charge thinking build protocol designed handle longtail exotic assets default need devs know insandouts charge listing assume tokens listed hostile weird 'balanceof' functions reentrancy fee transfer increases composability protocol security overall philosophy
371238,
371241,henlo admin lobster dao missing list 
371243,norme
371244,
371246,guys think happen aave borrowed positions ethereum 20 live dont know close borrowed postitions due bugs
371247,
371248,oracles uniswap also safe
371249,technically yes market volatility related issues
371250,ethpow quality logo website runned best scammers business
371251,post actually showing scam already succefull 20k defi degens discussing let's stop ethpow shill plz
371252,shitty ass logo lmao
371253,
371254,true true
371255,recovering doubleoracle failure extreme unlikely event oracles fail liquity uses last good price seen operations effectively freezing price used system however liquity still best recover switch back primary oracle comes back online 
371256,course assumes tellor keep working given claim decentralization
371257,depends anyone wants answer ethpow paid tellorpow doubtful imo
371258,doubt oracle project actually support ethpow
371259,paid
371260,
371261,nahhhhh
371262,best address visualization tool see funds deposit went visualizating transfers well
371263,
371266,centralized entities enforce threat retroactive sanctions users previously interacted 
371267,i'm completely mistaken pay reporters trb nobody actually listen ethpow paid forked version trb value
371268,lol privacy illegal
371269,moronity outstanding
371270,privacy never thing maybe hybird privacy
371271,monero solves
371272,automatically sending jail
371273,sanctioning
371274,lol anymore
371275,suppose that's nice roundabout way saying 3las ones running tcash relayers
371276,like shit post bored government sanctions nothing
371277,wish gifs allowed
371279,reason could tornado cash optional unlike monero
371285,nobody going jail using entire network that's private design
371287,well honestly kind expected 
371288,soooo what's stopping tornado cash implementing tornado cash v2
371289,tornado contract choose use attempted thing monero they'd need sanction entire network likely sanctioning tor
371290,monero really anonymous though chainalysis prop soft
371291,compromises mass adoption fetish looks like 
371292,mean can't rekt using
371293,sanction website actual mixing contract
371294,actual contracts
371295,contracts
371296,used tornado going jail mean someone used tornado create fresh wallets instead cex 
371297,gonna fun see fiatcoins fiatcoins deposited
371298,remember people claiming pools save 
371299,idk make sense apply retroactively know
371300,retroactive going forward
371301,tornado cash new wallet buy nft old wallet fresh monies
371302,u r definitely going jail
371303,going jail
371304,jail farming
371305,
371306,anonymity pool size bad side race takes time get sdn initially updating likely much faster also technically v2 since dec19 would waiting v3 based new tech somehow based known addresses tricky say least
371307,vote decide jail gets better dinners
371309,wen jail token
371310,vote gets rapedshanked
371311,need apple strategy new v version every year always product
371312,yo wtf
371313,drop soap
371314,dao decentralized ass operation
371315,i'm pretty sure they'll going jail team announced thing they're generously public people twitter
371316,happens forks
371317,announced criminalizing mining program instead liquidity mining program torn launch lol spam random addresses random amounts dirty crypto perpetuity
371319,nah works least technically practice governments find way broke law guess try hard enough developing something allows badthingstm us considered free speech somehow often using badthingstm explicitly listed sdns hand illegal sure
371320,wait second someone technically make contract mixes like 001 eth tornado cash something send like 10k addresses based parameters like acc balance 100k usd basically fuck people purpose making go sanctions list lol
371321,would pretty easy argue mass scale targeted transfer someone's address could deadly though
371322,well v3 explicitly bad thing still bad thing pretend different people forking people trust gate especially given risk could favorite 3las launching honeypot
371323,yeah idea everyone sanctioned criteria sanctioning becomes useless
371324,mean trick someone accepting mixed funds would render wallet address illegal
371325,something telling us opened pandoras box want actively enforce
371326,that's point yes wallets can't reject funds
371327,risk making entire network sanctioned people would take privacy seriously lol
371328,long illegal lol
371329,hi anyone know chaosmonkey type system erc20 something tries launch bunch bs break thing exist
371330,
371331,us sanctions virtual currency mixer tornado cash wsj us treasury tornado cash used launder 7b since 2019 wsj us tornado cash used launder north korea cybercrime funds wsj
371332,us internet used cybercrime communications north korea

371342,pretty sure 'financial institutions' always steered clear tornado
371343,wonder moves privacy narrative forefront crypto consciousness keeps longer week
371344,live society
371345,hope
371346,stablecoins next imo could interesting time short pegs stables
371347,least something meaningful compared scams jpegs
371348,far we've seen pockets communities super privacy focused large degens dont care
371350,1% always loudest general noone cares privacy theyre making money doxxed generall people care one late web2 prime example
371351,industry care privacy priority matters
371352,100% agreed alex got crypto privacy aspect chainalysis came around realized btc wasnt private thoughthoped
371353,industry acts interests money privacy adds friction decreases profits generally eroded
371354,yes money privacy guess
371355,care privacy preventingmaking hard illegal stuff would also help ecosystem forcing hackers go extra mile
371356,bull case monero
371357,redacted shameless implicit plug
371358,wen delete fiatcoins tornado
371359,anyone tracking freezing
371360,easy practice realistically regulatory perspective
371361,privacy seems like nothing proposition
371362,binary dont
371363,
371364,imo create permissioned pool contract hit ball regulator solve unpermissioned ofac similar designations handsoff approach sort asscovering exercise aave done imo arc permissioned pools really profitable regulators act noone cares care
371365,that's nonsensical permissioned there's privacy
371366,without naming specifics many zero knowledge tools available validate amlkyc anonymous way dont think mainnet yet theyre widely adopted obvious reasons noone care yet im giong comment anymore tbh im close look like selfpromo lame
371367,anonymous kyc oxymoron

371374,50% block rule afaik like need block assets something originate 50% sanctioned sources rule freeze funds precedent sanctioned addresses
371375,wanna go jail already never used tornado even tiring ahhhh let die peace exhausting
371377,pretty certain zilch sanction
371378,hey everyone saw tornado news mean stop using wallet previously interacted w tornado 
371379,use cexs instead tornadocash

371894,actually remember using check shit works
371895,like years ago
371896,guy replied made look like circle going randomly freeze peoples assets without external trigger true principle course best interest thats wanted communicate reply think
371897,wbtc though considering design current contracts need brick current one
371898,dm'ing
371899,may best interest undeniably true
371900,counter accurate helpful fud disingenuous best
371901,yes banks exchanges use figure risky addresses
371902,yes agreed see hes coming seem malicious heat moment thing
371903,welp fallon violates us sanctions
371904,tweet replied clearly meant farm engagement rational discussion actually inform people
371905,mean tool check addys
371907,that's true
371908,
371909,far malicious insinuate fiatcoin cannot anytime reason whatsoever render money useless
371910,may keys certainly coins
371911,he's ceo fiatcoin spends time marketed better tether know better
371912,tweet literally linked article says freeze funds part took issue clearly guy acted like arbitrarily
371913,people pointed contradiction correct
371914,posted contradiction within tweet like thats link leads
371915,that's i'm saying
371916,different hedera lying whitepaper
371917,yes likely quick response part big maliicous attempt lie people need get people making mistakes sometimes
371918,actually worse least hedera walked back claims eventually
371919,would give benefit doubt evidence mistake
371920,definitely argue saying circle issuer usdc freeze usdc address time whatever reason without context creates degree fud
371921,people read see fud people trying sell fiatcoin something 
371922,unambiguously true every sense word many people seek minimize realities using fiatcoin using flowery language andor hiding technical details bottom needlessly wordy lawyerspeak people read know unsurprisingly ceo said fiatcoin one
371923,yes promise blah blah blah 1000 words later best interest blah blah blah
371924,many people seek minimize realities using algostables using flowery language andor hiding technical details bottom needlessly wordy lawyerspeak people read know
371925,would algostable need lawyerspeak
371926,certainly call algostables find though
371927,sorry replaced lawyerspeak 'hype' complicated diagrams
371928,disagreeing annoyed algostables misrepresenting agreed comment wrt
371929,things necessarily complicated that's fault would much rather million algostables yet another fiatcoin pretend fiatcoin wrapper
371930,
371932,want make fiatcoin wrapper least lie like top 2 today
371933,i'm arguing people traces stained eth irrelevant police equating guy personally giving instructions north korea evade sanctions
371934,i'm saying opsec good practices respecting law live least paper etc etc important things i'm saying like fear porn like 10 years ago bitcoin buy drugs hire hitmen bought bitcoin would go similar narratives use defi kyc can't protect interacting nk haxxorz
371935,traces stained eth different choosing use tornado sanctioned
371937,there's censorship like self censorship
371938,seems like algostables still unsolved need least one 'legit' fiatcoin wrapper
371939,maybe palestinian care
371940,impact tornado cash sanctions stablecoins care decentralized stablecoins options anon 
371941,ymmv
371942,good enough purposes whether they're irrelevant police that's problem worry
371943,there's huge difference oh would neighbour think use bitcoin actual sanctions one ignore can't
371944,agree like people rugged thousands coins thousands people
371945,make mistake technical difference today yesterday tornado 2x harder access much still possible feeling lucky means lol
371946,mean actual narrative swallowed years police investigate buying bitcoin else would buy consequences reading whitepaper nothing else journalists
371947,trying leave impact many contract interact get rekt surprised
371948,yeah code works othersame devs free copypaste non sanctioned contracts even try launder sanctioned eth 
371949,saying simply things small scale unimportant get persecuted even noticed however mean get persecuted cross line unlucky
371950,narrative pushed without sort backing even law behind essentially media fluff equivalent would neighbour think actual weight behind specific set laws back enforce context
371951,yeah much agree
371952,sure could use lot pushback increase unnecessary risks likelihood affected frozen assets legal issues etc significantly increased
371953,yeah 100% agree statement i'm also saying someone usa case accept coins mean everyone dance around necessarily maybe people wanting make statement contrary can't tell code etc etc
371954,neither pretending substitute financial system malfunctioning code work nobody develops current state things around crypto nowadays build global non kyc system can't stop may interact unbanked people better said known beginning would happen
371955,hard american mind understand countries outside us real people living separate life separate set standards
371956,i've read dozens projects wanting put stocks american stock market dex going avoid selling american stocks iranian none documents see dev developing thing unaware consequences sounds best good dev

371958,interact people sanctioned countries problems people sanctioned countries
371959,geez hard discuss uncertain regulations regulators
371960,anything uncertain ofac i'd much rather 10 sec pdfs lol
371964,gonna ban u r americans chill please spam
371966,that's saying american entity expected comply american rules case whether user nonamerican american point seem really matter go jail trying hide small transaction probably assets frozen associated particular wallet probably yes
371967,sry
371968,protip buy lobs seek shelter lobsterdao kingdom ivan hurt
371971,hypothetically speaking would interesting know interacted sanctioned country unknowingly receive money intermediary say company company client said client gets investigated nk money mean something even part money used pay given nature wallets hard argue judge x z wallets middle stained eth last wallet end willingly helping sanctioned country
371972,couch legal stops tornadoinspiredfakelawyers piss talked lusd rai dai sai mai fai kai lai last fake obviously talked consequences talked blacklisting talked forks tornado lulz aztec fork ofc etc end also talked truly decentralized concepts harder time scaling etc stop repeating stuff circles use ctrlf new stuff pops every retarded message nonexpert ban memes memes go kingdom aka buy shit nft u spam 
371973,go ahead try kind sers 
371974,thoughts uniswap foundation vote 
371975,uniswap company
371976,one benefits foundation foss projects pay people work project uniswap already along tons contributors can't really see benefit another entity
371977,little confusing existence uniswap labs protocol ventures uniswap grants
371978,read comments
371979,uniswap company
371980,guys wont eth xmr atomic swaps solve issue reaction today already working btc atomic swap successful eth tesnet swaps
371981,atomic swaps fine needs way determine price swap since lping option
371982,kinda boring sit xmr smart contracts sight
371983,swap fresh new wallet
371984,rather easy track unless split funds also move funds multiple times increase anonset
371985,tornado standardized amounts
371986,aztec moment especailly defi added could see exchanges supporting zketh zkdai directly usa citizens tho
371987,what's current anonymity set aztec
371988,tornado c 200k eth
371990,
371991,pretty good capping 5eth 10k dai
371992,thanks maybe deposit cap place able walk fine line longer nk hackers find much use cap
371993,whats hard swapping 100 eth xmr 2 3 swaps back fresh wallet seems like simple price pay anonymity
371994,could still use would take long time
371995,timing analysis attack wait awhile else people track output eth back eth deal xmr price volatility
371996,liquidity
371997,case tornado anyway minus volatility
371998,last checked btcxmr liquidity still picked
371999,100 eth xmr moves around deposits 100eth back ca sees 100 eth swapped waits see new address eth
372000,chart xmr eth time swap trend quite simple
372001,eth whole time could deposit wait months still amount eth xmr could tank end less eth
372002,much since forced set amounts
372003,anyone know good growth hacker
372004,deposit 75 eth send 25 next wallet
372005,yeah would need break way ca fooled
372006,time x anonset key
372007, timing market quite difficult lol
372008,yea id say hurdle currently way
372009,swapping eth xmr
372010, hopefully cex sure trustless xmr eth eth xmr
372011,example happening irl 
372012,100 seems kinda low proving
372013,missing point would work 1 100 1m dollars
372014,problem effects every privacy protocol touches public sphere
372015, would work 0 reward perhaps someone knows financial incentive publicise fact
372016,ah sorry misread comment 
372017,show total regardless token deposited eth eth deposited
372018,think eth
372019,zcash offers opt privacy that's kinda broken
372020,ah heres something calculates anonset 
372021,yeah opt privacy always vulnerable spying crackdowns
372023,buy rips sell dips 
372024,atomic swaps chain still use services like sideshift etc
372025,sideshift cex
372026,half dex
372027,tell tries find decentralized way swap coins cant asks kyc
372028,sideshift ask kyc
372029,hope jinx though 
372030,mistake i'm thinking shapeshift
372031,sideshift operates outside us jurisdiction already
372032,sideshift gives back coins
372033,yeah
372034,matter even little bit americans use
372035, vpn tor i2p
372036,sure
372037,great swapping smaller amounts crosschain
372038,here's playbook fbi agent emails informing american trying swap nothing swap rekt
372039,every piratedarknetcustodial mixeretc takedown follows process
372040,hows broken even atomic swap transparent taddress shield fully shielded zz transaction whatever address need whatever amount want nobody earth would able trace problem zcash kinda homework able use properly
372041,broken way matter privacy hermeticallysealed recipient messages open basketball hoop
372042,ok see mean
372043,lucky may fortunate enough recipient cares privacy much recipients enough people nonprivate scheme kinda useless like covering black cloth middle lit room thinking one sees things like fb friends get information even though never gave directly family clicks yes permissions like robots know better companies gladly hose available data
372044,know one team
372045, shilling ze bag banteg thx example treasury transparency
372046,yis
372047,well worst happen leak funds received yet information wont disclose bank account everyone nobody still able see funds isnt financial privacy
372048,shielded txs default
372049,iirc
372050,want privacy use cash share private keys kek
372051,cant track transactions never moves
372052,slowly moving cashless society wont always option
372053,enough people way guy middle lit room running around black cloth head screaming i'm invisible
372054,yeah well nobody cares privacy fd default try lil optimistic
372055,offers sort privacy suppose reason advise try drink cup water fishing net i'd advise want consider alternatives first
372056,haram
372057,true that's better
372064,dont believe case removed trusted setup tho also cool
372065,think zcash tries play nice get tornadoed
372066,zook definitely pro reg
372067,go read twitter
372068,dont think bad thing done right
372069,done right huge though
372070,yeah seems like public default consequences clear ttot transaction works like bitcoin sender receiver transaction value publicly visible many wallets exchanges exclusively use taddresseses today many moving shielded addresses better protect user privacy 
372071,dont get
372072,that's definitely blackclothlitroom privacy
372073,standard satisfy ok ivan
372075,coiner sambacha u smart doesnt excuse 1 word per message related sam tbh
372076,guess one uses shielded options kinda pointless
372077,im still waiting see zcash cook privacy narrative evolve looking good tbh
372078,crypto exchange nuri previously called bitwala files insolvency germany link
372079,moonwell launches governance forum gauntlet publishes review moonwell post nomad 
372080,yeah unless dreaded criminals stake entire eth lido dump received tokens curve hyperbole maybe hopefully
372081,oh nice used bitwala client back 2017 excited new release quickly stopped since fuckin impossible kyc ive seen life
372083,xmr zcash privacy default optional privacy
372084,choice believe dont blame personally dont buy moneros fam arguments zcash choice lets leave
372086,long youre privacy youre good 
372087,principle tor risk always comes interacting clearnet onion sites
372088,closer get circular system easier defend systems privacy
372089,someone trolling celebs sending eth tornado cash article
372090,tbf due solaris bank charge
372091,bitwalanuri iswas shinier frontend
372092,offered celcius staking app maybe that's reason
372093,oooooooof
372094,eur funds safu solaris they're saying
372095,well long need offon crypto ramps going problem see way around
372096,thanks know one name touch wasted much time bullshit
372097,even minimizing amount data collected helps lower spying potential said onramps
372098,buying xmr fiat tells exchange much xmr buying eth tells exchange everything eth
372099,
372100,many better alternatives since 2014 adopted privacy always developed go parallel defi far check pivx nav plenty
372103,link tornado though
372104,right something right
372105,lobster daily 497 daily recap 8 august 1 liquity handle eth pow pos drama link discussion 2 best address visualization tool link discussion 3 specially designated nationals list update tornado cash added read link discussion 4 bad collateral root cause recent collapses like terra algorithmic stablecoins link link discussion 5 sideline capital 23 billion count size link link discussion
372106,makes wonder maybe yet another reason sun involved pow chain wonder sees angle top liquity positions still even actually make lusd viable pow
372107,
372108,yay midjouney pics
372109,say exclusively
372110,lobs commuity art kingdom 
372112,pools already frozen
372113,uniswap curve tornado
372114,sounds like good exit strategy circle
372116,sam's take pretty nave
372117,think missed point
372118,mean else say
372119,oh get point far almost every crypto statement labelled unlikely happened
372120,also point point easy blacklisting 1 address frax controls unlikely happen yes structural holding usdc different maker's example entirely psm contracts
372121,get point since addresses formally owned entities like bank accounts really matter ofacs point view frax sanctioned usdc may compelled blacklist wide scope narrow one uncharted territory knew day would come high time prepare next one
372122,literally said op tweet verbatim i'm sure point 
372123,yeah blacklist address depositing pools
372124,tornado gitcoin grants blacklisted technically address operated external service
372125,read original tweet that's literally said
372126,sloppy cant ends sams post good context
372127,wtf
372130,since
372131,blacklist uniswap pool blacklist depositing address usdc stay forever said blacklist others well correct
372132,blacklist permanent
372133,interesting permit router like uniswap may end blacklisting
372134,that's true talking blacklist function go look code actual function takes single address argument
372135,maybe still validating
372136,digital gulags
372137,well exactly ofac blacklist anything true affect onchain usdc hand saying unlikely usdc blocks public pools bit stretch since beyond control we're kansas anymore sadly
372138,
372139,hence depositing address blacklisted lp withdrawal transfer fail
372140,agreed actually agree
372141,yup
372142,unban
372143,simply send lp token another address wdym
372144,advice
372145,potentially one attack vault
372146,sure that's problem there's timelock dao upgrade policy withdraw new address way actually get usdc frozen either hit permanently contract frax dao time blacklisting effective
372147,yaexactly
372148,yeah work permit automation tracking
372149,hand typed addresses etherscan id bet yet
372152,least understanding
372153,matter time innit
372154,code method remove addresses blacklist principle
372156,new pinned message year ffs
372157,clear rhethorical question answer
372158,sounds good kingdom 
372160,scared sir
372169,scared frens got banned
372172,link kingdom list
372180,sers reached 20k today 
372181,ivan going give speech
372185,buy spam much better play earn
372187,curve ui seemingly getting mitm attacked use atm
372188,quick announcement become aware potential issue front end could lead approving bad contract safety ask everyone make approvals swaps locate issue make sure safe
372189,confirm friend mine got wallet drained approval
372190,
372192,amen
372193,curve finance frontend seems compromised malicious approval tx popping 
372194,daily hacks getting tiresome ngl
372195,beginning security web3 meme
372196,agree get better stronger
372197,anyone know anything new web3 gaming company limitbreak gabe leydon machine zone founder always fan gabe leydon thinking games years saw they'd raised stealth curious anyone happens know probably reach
372198,always issues web2 web3 lot vulnerabilities js dns issues time
372199,recession started year numbers going skyrocket
372200,cant apply lusd governance cant freeze someone minting lusd long eth collateral counterparty value eth
372201,also true lusd uses chainlink oracles chainlink oracles proxy patterned upgradeable chainlink signers
372202,true chainlink oracles pretty much break defi anyway change oracle provider necessary future
372203,
372204,well i'm correcting take indeed require trust chainlink signers oracle lusd uses
372205,that's ppl say careful chainlink fwiw
372206,using tellor backup contracts immutable weve also seen first smart contract ban whats say lusd oracle supplying data isnt getting flagged future 
372207,well yes said excluding chainlink frax lusd seem like would take immense lockdown blockchain shut however
372208,tellor alone reliable source liquity would dry scenario
372209,yeah fully aware saying living cause chainlink allows another centralized entity forced act certain way tho
372210,kinda think rai lusd
372211,left oracle vector open switch case fuckery
372213,lusd rekt
372215,doesnt rai use chainlink well
372216,although need proceed caution curveexchange seems unaffected uses different dns provider
372217,pretty scary ive wondered chainlink couple years
372218,yeah point elsewhere
372219,lusd cant since immutable
372220,lusd exclusively dependent chainlink
372221,stated using tellor backup
372222,fails tellor kicks fails well dies
372223,better pretend game maker frax
372224,meh shit really doesnt really matter circle forced blacklist chainlink forced upgrade sanction everybody using tellor smart contract right theyve pretty much shown theyre willing either things last couple days
372225,kinda win legal battle able literally blacklist entire smart contracts 
372227,could cause tellor fail
372228,really one group sells fiatcoin wrapper something pretty straightforward dependencies
372229,shame hindsight use onchain oracle v3 exactly exist time 
372230,chainlink blacklists lusd due sanctions even worse contracts immutable changeable lqty holders governance kind governance would easy switch twap oracle permabricks lusd
372231,thats viable solution kinda moment depend people price data kinda gg even uniswap pair use peg cant use ethusdt ethusdc 
372232,thing governance could point considering governance could sanctioned brick dubious
372233,gonna using tellor indefinitely gonna get exponentially risky people gonna look exit prolly
372234,governance also attack vector 
372236,course getting pricing data rise level sanction
372237,i'm worried total immutability lusd contracts chainlink stops serving lusd right possible lusd holders lqty holders greater community anything basically
372238,mean could argued nah essence enabling creation decentralised stable talking lusd attacked kinda means reason right prevents circle forced blacklist uniswap pools deliver price reference data allows illegal decentralised stablecoins build
372239,issue found reverted approved contracts curve past hours please revoke immediately please use curveexchange propagation curvefi reverts normal contract needs revoked 0x9eb5f8e83359bb5013f3d8eee60bdce5654e8881 approved please revoke immediately 
372240,delivery merely coincidental though anything circle asked blacklist uniswap facilitates illegal currency exchange far likely
372241,point people maybe consider pegging something usd fiatcoin experiments
372242,mean dealing people thought entire tc ban point wouldnt surprised shit like happening
372243,freeze sanction circle blacklist using lusd rai legal perspective
372244,think major issue trying peg anything first place either deal centralized entities issuing themand wrap shit 10 times centralized oracles making possible governance able attack peg doesnt sound promising tbh compromises top compromises
372245,yeah that's great upgradable gov
372246,nope none entirely immutable decentralized lqty gov rights
372247,chainlink decides upgrade contracts lusd can't use nothing done
372248,mean theoretically continue running long tellor reports prices none oracles report anymore use last known price forever
372249,could argued chainlink blacklists kinda
372250,seems like protocols aiming core primitives need upgradable entirely selfcontained
372251,guess instant fair like said code continues report last price reported oracles hopefully give enough time lusd holders sell everything late i'd assume peg would even volatile currently right that's kind great outcome either
372252,that's view well
372253,someone working oracles think youre actually building something oracles youre able adjust potential changes youre world trouble much change andor go wrong blind trust oracle project kinda insane
372254,totally i've always confused lusd holders bragging literally nothing code ever changeable forever immutable
372255,would make sense something like uniswap amm basically tool needs nonchanging structure make sense anything trying stable value
372256,can't create new contracts get ppl convert long way around usually works get ppl close positions time migrate mean someone deployed intial contracts right someone could deploy new ones
372257,immutability meme window tho 
372258,work integrated lusd protocol every single thing stack would also need change
372259,yep precisely would
372260,changed thing better change course hit iceberg see coming
372261,change governance instead that's point governable stablecoin like uniswap base layer consensus contracts anything
372262,redeploy upgradable oracles redeploy immutable contracts nr2 would use youre gonna migrate new version everytime face oracle troubles
372263,requires goverance that's way someone release contracts update front end
372264,oracles issue plagues solidity chainlink center point failure code oracle source ever screwed go pull basket oracle feeds self twap value
372265,think important thing understand tradeoffs people saying lusd impervious things dai frax weak quite right daifrax impervious lot things simple fixes us would rek lusd force redeploy everything basically dead
372266,mim
372267,
372268,kind moot lusd liquidity multiples dai frax go large scale solution ham stringed immutability plus mind crypto anything ever changing
372273,depends unlike chainlink tellor permissioned
372274,agreed 100% protocol certain strengths value propositions though none perfect
372276,long someone willing report price continue work
372277,report price accurately often tellor either least past
372278,thinking proposing attack proposing lusd would completely unnecessary pretendao would simply need go said pretendao
372279,reason need jump hoop going chainlink impervious direct attack frax makerdao vulnerable also pretendao risk
372280,wtf pretendao like derogatory way saying fake dao
372281,practice
372282,k cool still change fact lusd fake dao would entirely rekt chainlink updated contracts remove great point guess
372283,pretendao would need go chainlink
372284,simply ask dao brick end jail wanna see many people willing risk freedom online voting game
372285,admittedly problem past last time checked reduced possible time updates accuracy well dependent amount people updates watching network
372286,can't put dao jail mean actual msig signers something oracle setting onchain tokenholder vote like governorbravo type contract since critical stablecoin system like lusd makerdao's oracles actually well done terms need updated
372287,can't put smart contract jail either useful stops tokenholders voting dead address new oracle
372288,last 60 days polygon single address fulfilled requests also lets kid moment chainlink would blacklist everybody would stop using lusd
372289,understand saying thing i'm pointing lusd immutable can't even change oracle way hardfork new token addresssystem contract bad everyone must already implicitely trust chainlink oracle keep serving liquity holding lusd
372290,claiming governance would solve hypothetical problem governance propose failure state
372291,sure idea absence pretendao liquity solves anything farce
372292,ya i'm saying
372293,yep that's basically i'm saying effect lusd like pretendao like call pretendao chainlink rather something else
372294,doesnt never pretended hammering stablecoin practically via proxy full control chainlink also semi nice
372295,
372296,sure talking literally go appfraxfinance daistatscom get real time transparent view much frax dai fiat wrapped took 20 minutes arguing admit lusd chainlink pretendao call even guess
372297,claim decentralized stablecoins
372298,best fiatcoin wrappers
372299,lusd chainlink pretendao
372300,fin
372301,ethcollateralized stablecoin uses chainlink's oracles nonexclusively different fiatcoin wrappers actual pretendaos also dependent oracles
372302,bru
372303,open dependencies somehow never shows tweets info put together infuennzzaaa stuff retweet
372306,youll find buried le docs tho
372307,unstoppable long chainlink allows 
372309,right even worse can't even change chainlink pretendao pretendao process
372310,entirety argument muddy waters claiming we're since use chainlink's oracles we're better way get blacklisted chainlink pretendao something reality possible 'fix' 'problem' liquity chainlink dependency completely irrelevant simply go straight dao point moot best
372311,disingenuity par course
372312,cool guess different flavors pretendao's different people suppose remind lusd fans least brand pretendao like us omit fiatcoin wrapper part sure
372313,would branded lqty governance token good attempt
372314,right link governance token cl msig signers
372315,make fiatcoin wrapper dependent 2 daos
372316,might want consider giving link holders tangible governance powers votes
372317,governance add
372318,might well also let usdc holders vote right 
372319,read recovering doubleoracle failure extreme unlikely event oracles fail liquity uses last good price seen operations effectively freezing price used system however liquity still best recover switch back primary oracle comes back online 
372320,one idea 3rdparty dependency constitutes dao
372321,throw eth
372322,ive seen presentation theyve given live oracle summit berlin exact questions asked answer cant change anything beyond rekt oracles failchange active choice made still running around twitter pretending decentralised dai retweeting shit people pretend full mercy 49 multisig way ever potentially overcome hurdle 
372323,decentralized dai objectively true
372324,kek honestly anything using glorified multisig calling decentralised farce kinda goes defi
372325,least maker votes people deploying unit makes oracles possible
372326,keep writing like they're exclusively dependent chainlink
372327,know project goes 0 dependancy gone
372328,pretending they're exclusively dependent chainlink
372329,bit farce justify immutable contracts simply deploying immutable contract centralized oracle project goes nature decentralised stablecoin slap tellor lulz decentralisation part even though never used entire tvl omega nuke chainlink ever stops serving stop pretend game pls
372330,sure think doubling lie answer question
372331,would say biggest risk decentralized stables may oracles create purely chain dataset 1 eth stable eth wbtc swap values allow us derive value 1 rough draft system could work could cut price feeds chain sources create immutable chain unit accounting data sets always derive values
372332,glib slap tellor supposed serious grasping straws make point
372333,whether would actually go 0 torn still well 0
372334,frank think real challenge decentralized stablecoins appear actual way scale without taking real world custody aka fiatcoin risk mentioned yesterday let forward wrote
372335,many reasons volatility eth need know every stablecoin built overcollateralized asset model fraction fraction either dai frax's mcap coincidence take real world data heart clearly illustrating point lusdfeisusdrai combined even reach 800m market cap although love individual unique innovations something learn teams world class incredibly small we're trying build stablecoin ants simply going grow past certain size using models crypto evidence single overcollateralizedonly stablecoin grows size rather shrinks time
372336,years ago dexs never gonna make either
372337,im literally reiterating bit drama liquity presented oracle summit better aligns values decentralised backstop theyre fully aware entire construct relies centralized entity setup even switched backup continuously try default chainlink theyre available preferred choice fully hands cl instead using project better aligned values obviously im gonna meme still go centralized one reasons pretty damn obvious moment cl gone liquity gonna everything power fork thats farce
372338,something hasnt happened yet doesnt mean wont
372339,question whether scale happened far dont scale till
372340,regurgitated point 3 times
372341,think doubling lie answer question
372342,true far evidence points overcollateralizedonly model going might unique innovation new stability mechanism fully decentralized scale billions onchain entirely far evidence show yet appear overcollatonly model
372343,well definitely scaling exact mechanism nonstop shrunk time there's probably yettobeinvented mechanism possibly
372344,based gigachad 
372346,scaling
372347,stop taking guy's bait lmao
372348,well clearly lusd users since there's 180m mcap demand total
372349,even collateralized stables become niche oracle problem still seems much larger realized
372350,clearly lol
372352,
372353,thoughts folks would love hear alternative opinions
372354,overall feel like contract approvals used necessary evil proper ux days thought put example eip would allow data token transfers
372355,also think theres something im missing technical benefits
372356, 
372357,hahaha
372358,felt stablecoin debate onesided comment liquity favor nonupgradable contracts became lengthy shared couple tweets 
372359,govt access chainanalysis pretty silly would take less time filter noise took create
372360,reality quite simple pointing things bad people vested interest distracting everyone muddying waters claiming strategy left
372361,quite similar grifter argument ago dare say virtually identical alas would expect nothing less principal parties involved selling things
372362,might want check word grifter means dictionary means smallscale swindling seeing lusd barely 12% 2% size frax dai respectively one side looks like grifter might want default calling everything else scam next everyone least knows true colors
372363,lol might want read post replying think i'm calling grifter

372365,mean definitely label i'd use one simply referencing argument week ago
372366,quote tweet defending chainlink relianceimmutability part earlier pretendao fiatcoin wrapper conversation case actually nothing lusd anything like lot like people pointing fair critiques frax dai ignoring fair ones smaller stablecoins that's 
372367,think well carry feel free search grifter interested lusd vs fiatcoin wrappers yes like either wrappers try sell something they're tangible benefit fiatcoin wrapping one manner liquity without pretendao games
372368,ignoring issues associated smaller stables know they're small difficult scale they're issues projectending risks though challenge usdc wrappers yes scale costs decentralization censorshipresistance think asking questions good especially given threat centralization trust people placed assets
372369,like fiatcoins changing anytime soon that's selling point dai frax wethesque immutable contract lot ought doable
372370,agree

372375,reason pretty easy something decentralization similar actually affect outcome though hold breath

372428,check 1inch paraswap matcha
372429,sure parhfinders right
372430,ah fair enough guess could pick top 5 10 amm likely large fraction total liquidity add xyk
372431,pathfinders project mean something like 0x1inch
372432,yeah readily available guess write python script good opportunity test ape framework
372433,ssd recovery usually impossible due trim hardware works different hdds
372434,equations uni v2 style liquidity paper oracle attack simulator allows calculate exactly uni v3 oracleeulerfinance
372435,ah yeah want real answer thatd way go figure quick spreadsheet numbers top amms would get reasonably close
372436,
372437,here's sheet quickly modified old twap analysis opposite want change target price ask much liquidty would need swapped move price 1 120

372496,users claiming free merkle root proof
372497,choosing cheaper chain
372498,otherwise paying 12000 dollars drop try gas super low
372499,also 6k unique addresses wont make 6k txs save fees erc721a

372517,looking ootb solution think get anything better vercel wrt sanctionability
372518,probably boot faster fill password either finagle something njalla host server 
372519,input addy
372524,web3 better sanctions forced upon web2
372525,rly web3
372526,reply message february lol
372527,yea know namecheap web3 let's use tornado example better
372528,still use tornado
372529,still permissioneless still working use youll piss uncle sam
372530,still use tornado really advanced crypto user everyone needs learn use every single dapp without proper ui going backwards forwards
372531,comment made namecheap one first organizations ban russian users within week many web3 daos protocols done thing web3 proven better
372532,including infura rpc provider metamask uses default
372533,even final form 
372534,hey peeps gsheet ago payed shiller twitter accounts anyone link somewhere i've trying find can't find anywhere anymore blz help 
372535,
372536,ipfs hosted ui tornado cash uis still use heck download single page html file use tornado importantly create tomorrow paypal shutsdown avenue access thoss functionalities
372537,seems cheaper previous ones
372538,beggars can't choosers
372539,people subscribe literally get dumped learn nothing
372540,know dump
372541,know places like unfamiliar understand discussions go influenceoors great job explaining relevance projects x z make number go gets views reason videos stupid faces thumbnails kids prone click expressive faces algo learned promote kids easy monetise via advertising likely watch full video deal videos green people watch longer get alpha etc they're valuable form content youtube etc meaning algo promotes creates vicious cycle promotion patterns subscribe accessible mentally b heavily promoted information transmitting medium they're accustomed well that's take anyway anyone got ideas
372542,frankly keeping world exhausting task even understand people full time jobs can't spend day monitoring anime tiddy pps
372543,shillfluencer talks project numba goes profit that's general idea
372544,mean influencers arent new even internet people newspapers advising stock buy people dont use much brains investing money happily trust someone calls expert easy work often terrible results ever heard parabel 
372545,practice goes bit like shillfluencer talks project numba goes people profit horde get time care less project start asking wen marketing generally fate can't get frontpage insert established site token holders users 
372546,nah stupid face thing universal even adults like also suspect facial tracking lets thumbnailsvideos famous faces gain significant algo boost
372547,bright green thing actually slightly unknown there's certain shade discovered game theory seems work hilariously well promote videos
372548,clickbait unreasonably effective video article comments
372549,types influencers battle top seo spot anyone new crypto sees video first thus subscribing thus thinking new garbage they're shilling amazing
372550,video excellent send clients explain even small tweaks outsized returns

372557,honest clickbait sounds tad like oxymoron lol get
372558,noob question code running makes txn metamask someone also make transaction chance collide happen something impossible happen ask type question
372559,probably get 'nonce high' 2nd one collide
372560,way think like cake looks nice also tastes great
372561,smart content tends make great tasting cake looks like covered sawdust
372562,using dove got acquired messari i'm using crunch base wondering anyone know alternative crypto vc funding websites groups influencer pages track early stage vc funding crypto projects
372563,ditto love dove mountain data behind messari paywall
372565,dove better overview tho sad see got bought
372566,i'm already group thanks suggestions also yea dove favorite crunch base bad either 
372567,anyone else issue dydx 
372568,starting feel like movie contagion 
372569,damn
372572,yeah got days ago tornado drama
372573,given pivot cosmos also relies offchain elements reason compliance provider carry
372574,hey guys i'm trying deploy simple erc721 contract remix goerli testnet test things try approve transaction metamask gives error could mean
372575,i've tried chains apart mainnet gives error
372576,leverage short platform bnb chain
372577,
372578,plz vote interested see result
372579,buy mean swapping eth already decided baghold steth
372580,vercel netlify surge github pages many aws s3 even ipfs arweave also run servers big deal however
372581,try deploy hardhat try brave browser remix funky sometimes simple browser switch fixed past
372582,considering github tornado guys immediately definitely getting rekt using github pages goes rest rely 3rdparty companies
372583,ya realise depends popular get youre 100 ways host static sites doesnt really matter domain getting hit harder
372584,3rdparty might interested shielding cloudflare even yield pr unfavorable
372585,ever remember dealing sanctionlevel threats new territory lol
372586,sorta random aws definitely boot vercel netlify dependent aws take 
372587,ya might messed question though maybe big discount get would better
372588,signal proxy service specifically use case fyi
372589,
372590,best censorship resistant alternative know alternatives 
372591, another alternative
372592,found odd elliptic shows ren bridge activity slander piece made chart scale looks different right
372594,guess would they're inflating numbers get contracts feels like used riaastyle mathematics
372595,course journalists bother check claims
372596,would require work editing basic math skills
372597,also called decentralized network darknodes 
372598,terrible piece
372599,assume darknodes made shadowy superhackers keep hearing
372600,dprk statesponsored hacking nodes
372601,anyone energy mackenzie seems keen engage people trust said engaging good faith previously
372602,
372603,oh nice definitely worth contacting cnbc big enough might change public perception elliptic report

372610,yep
372611,entire platform rests one company worst chip earth
372612,always found weird
372613,basically cheap way add privacy something
372614,think would learnt amt vulnerabilities
372615,aaaaaand we're around 510 blocks away goerli merge
372616,scrt decent piece tech predecessor enigma pioneered use zkps ethereum 5 years ago help sgx tho many peeps saying

372626,late reorg
372627,saw pandas lighthouse 30 mins erigon

372682,yes
372683,boostflashbotsnet
372684,sorry another possibly stupid question affect manifold business somehow general relevant pos
372685,effectively validator nodes control mev attacks technically means mev attacks done conjunction nominators well
372687,think approach spot alpha 
372689,mev attack still done searchers bot validatingcreating blocks done validator nodes instead mining poolnodes
372690,would nodes penalized malicious behavior attacks proven
372691,ordering inclusion valid transactions slashable offense pos that's asking
372692,yes exactly thanks

372699,win anything 149 subscription 
372700,surprisingly claims yes
372701,mean accounts wont alpha groups
372702,skeptical helpful retweets accounts huge waste money youre creator paying fees
372703,people listening likely followers bots anyway
372704,past influencers valuable nft instagram page expensive great roi example state market different today

372751,would cdps get liquidated
372752,isnt whole job maker auctions
372753,
372754,longer profitable liquidate perhaps
372755,tie dai eth death spiral lunaust
372756,
372757,merge block noone cares
372758,merge ttd
372759,think idea way much eth enough demand much eth
372760,exactly lunaust circular dependency case ethdai dai depends eth opposite would say partially mitigated
372761,thisnot exactly eth mature independent sources demand luna keep mind luna also gas token dissimilarjust luna demand gas way less terra new
372762,well mechanism ofcourse maker dao converts 35 billion usdc eth free fall eth price constant liquidation pressure probably result severe depeg
372763,know resources regulation eu companies works defi like exchanges banks 
372764,tether centralization risks usdccircle
372765,curious treasury force tether blacklist
372766,already done
372767,tether frozen
372768,yes worse cause less law controlled maybe better cause less law controlled
372769,ser blz read ctrlf idk know usdt usdc freezes
372770,think liquidators might interested 'keeper' fees 3% discount ethdai pair eths dropping 10% worst case scenario would want liquidate 3%
372771,3% discount top 10% drop literally everyone would want liquidate
372772,
372773,oasisapp started using trm labs like uniswap
372774,emulated real look source code
372775,tokens identical smartcontracts
372776,remember dai v2 fully collateralized eth problems
372777,ust 20
372778,would collateral liquidate eth eth cdps denominated usdc

372782,checked ive never blocked uniswap
372783,welp cant say didnt see coming
372784,ipfs version etherscan
372785,make sense still need indexing stuff
372786,etherscan go else interact directly contract
372787,
372788,decentralized evm block explorer
372789,supports various evm chains
372790,try checking otterscan well 
372791,tools use eg brownie maybe ape
372792,decentralized
372793,afaik ipfs static stuff
372794,also full app js stuff served via ipfs would significant subgraph api integration though replicate etherscan functionality
372795,surprised pikachu
372796,defi became safi
372797,supposed start fresh eth wallet days tornado cash every exchange shits

372841,lefterisjp isnt shooting messenger bit institutions wanting transact web3 platforms need sort sanctions compliance place prosecuted definitely happens say yes slipped least compliance program place used professional expertise validate counterparty wallet institutions wont skill inhouse trm provides service felt sick heard news tc ramifications seemed obvious coming compliancelegal background part accepts ways tc sanction another step journey towards widespread adoption even better privacy solutions gives industry leverage regulators know tech always one step ahead whackamole imo tornado cash never going viable longterm privacy solution
372842,late can't get long discussion field using solutions field want work wanted work traditional finance would gone 10yrs ago adoption mean sacrificing soul space
372843,turns sure tabled real hard norm trying appease institutions lol
372844,i'd rather insititions lobby rules make sense help build perfect panopticum
372845,situation similar chains forfeited pow consensus 51% attack vulnerability see bch ravencoin etc real threat choice abandon pow consensussecurity use gimmick deciding reward amounts alternative attacked completely destroyed
372846,actionable decisions made either accept defi blockchainsettled improvement tradfi go try create something really decentralized second one going require physical relocation least
372847,well written usdt kind big fail exchanges dominant users stable coin pairs using usdt
372848,imho seems nothing big fail crypto usdt merely x3 ust top
372849,thats true actually usdt better liquidity comparing ust extreme cases usdt users exit exchanges ust mainly rely liquidity providers curve others 
372850,usdt also blocked infinitely hacked funds compared usdc blocked none
372851,usdt also get funds back sent smart contract ability move erc20s usdc wont 
372852,also weve seen happens people try bank run usdt 10b survived
372853,mean one address usdt 
372854,mean get usdc locked usdt contract gone
372855,usdt theyll print replace
372856,contact
372857,accidentally sent 30k
372858,contract 30k usdc example half mine
372859,tether team help 10 percent fee
372860,fine
372861,contact
372862,im sure 
372863,nope google policy
372864,submit request
372865,cool thanks
372866,feel like losing usdc finding usdt refund may net positive end everyone else actually gets usdt back 
372867,dont even made tool works usdt erc20 token
372868,dont purpose 
372869,nice thinking something like makes sense exist
372870,think needs get integrated something like metamask go mainstream trust
372871,another note wallets really warn youre sending money smart contract empty address
372872,address looks like cant move erc20s
372873,i'm happy made first withdrawal scammed thanks team introduce colleagues thanks 
372874,first simple straightforward
372875,
372876,anyone used metamask snap btw wondering metamask fixes possible theyll eventually accept changes core community adds
372877,i'm saying metamask suggested
372878,last time tweeted make set approve way clear update came week later likely wasnt 
372879,trivial check recipient smart contract granted false negatives ethereum quirks cover 999999%
372880,multisigs
372881,yes one quirk
372882,probably check long give warning user always still decide theyre certain
372883,another fatal one idea turn accounts smart contracts without providing way distinguish humans smart contracts
372884,also way report addresses similar google youre phishing site
372885,mean turning addresses contracts
372886,look account abstraction eips
372887,case would always able check transfer erc20 capability
372888,ethereum here's one 
372889,unless i'm missing something there's way tell
372890,cool vaguely remember ago
372891,check certain methods conforms interface
372892,that's token
372893,smart contract transfer tokens via 3rdparty contract based preset approval another via literal transfer function withdraw function there's generalized deal token indicator
372894,might cover cases
372895,gnosis multisigs check matches example
372896,anyone seen ist paper agoric looks alot like terra without anchor 
372897,maker 3 types collaterisation hold varying pegs dollar
372898,perhaps point starts get lot thorny simply getcode'ing recipient
372899,said given current events maybe good thing would pretty funny paste address met error address 'risk' transaction rejected lol
372900,basic level warn smart contract next level would warn sending known contract type dont think need many exceptions standard contracts
372901,mutlisigs mayve exception basically
372902,dunno wonder many people want sending anything smart contract least tell user contract let decide even looking scare
372904,also contracts signal things like implement ierc20receivable dont know reliable practice could avoid warning potentially
372905,where's can't find oz
372906,one nfts erc721
372907,anyone know main tornado cash address interact actually using tornado cash guy
372908,
372909,first second question
372910,mine
372911,first yes second
372912,blockscout best open source explorer
372913,
372914,fun
372917,dumb question eth fork guess weth chains like matic etc wont get airdropped ethw
372927,wonder pattern videos build sort bot
372928,anyone study much volume generates shillfluencers impact order book liquidity pools amms
372929,speculation anyone think regulators come trade exchanges given market structure ie would come amms associate amms illicit activity
372930,sorry seen discussion i'm wondering us based 'persons' move activities sort 'swiss bank' equivalent crypto world
372933,often nonexistent
372934,anyone wellversed lightning taro tried search answer questions 1 node manage lusdbtc conversion rate oracles pools 2 node keeps receiving lusd sending btc node balanced node operator doesnt end selling btc lusd

372977,unless dare make pseudonymous account heretofore unknown act space
372978,dont think turning point black hacking everyone knows caught police work ever stopped people hacking
372979,precedent surely temporarily scare people
372980,turning point arresting opensource devs written code someone else may use crime
372981,turns reason arrest article clear seems imply stuff
372982,yeah full data case turn arrested reasons release get needed information
372983,guys really think opsec takes escape government actively looking
372984,likely mentioned someone used code crimeamoney laundering
372985,people dont hide anything crypto people opsec reasons
372986,youre going anon hide average joe bagholder sure takes whole lot effort untraceable get sanctioned
372987,opsec trace
372988,bit late lol
372989,i'd surprised holds court might well arrest every bank employee facilitating illicit transfers decades nation states printing cash used drug trades etc monero atomic swaps fin
372990,90's cryptodevs used balls dunno today 
372991,due time problem deploying programs decentralized ethereum technology without receiving proper authorization implementing necessary checks
372992,yeah thats went largely extrajudicial tool sanctions making difficult possible use courts reverse decision probably know itd never hold least us
372993,heh 
372994,really drug war indication long there's demand privacy people willing pay people providing services
372995,kinda reminds dread pirate robert case vanned developing platform serving life sentence
372997,remember liberty reserve service people use use send receive money privately bitcoin founder sentenced 20 years

372999,even cto given maximum sentence five years pleading guilty operating unlicensed money transmitting business
373000,operating key word
373001,us could kill every tornado dev missile strikes itd still continuing offer privacy different cases including silk road
373002,way kill make impossible cash tornado pretty much theyre
373003,unlikely 100% effective
373004,people guess takes time build infrastructure support blacklist contracts infura infrastructure always anon

373020,may true indeed sure lists public
373021,vitalik blacklisted scared dapp devs lol
373022,
373023,highly likely yes
373024,reports tornado related bans know uniswap banning nomad related addresses trm labs sends list guess opensea random bans related tornado
373025,funniest thing decided make sanctions retroactive logic 99% us corpos banned used business russia
373026,sushi curve ban users list somewhere trm labs partners

373040,turns friends listening 
373041,tfw getting gary'd looks like good thing
373042,funny enough one popular tweets using hashtag aptos wallet lol
373043,anyone good resource onchain privacy solutions proscons couple things come mind certainly would like indepth knowledge via cex really private kyc least severs direct link onchain two wallets via bridge many bridges allow bridgeandtransferto via dex ie uniswap's swapandtransferto railgun aztec else exists
373044,want overview live protocols underlying technologies
373045,
373046,really enduser retain degree privacy onchain ie changing fresh new wallet per year
373047,sers regarding tc developer anywhere actually specifies arrested fact building tc rather illegal shit
373048,current consensus gov seems north korea even ask question
373049,literal fiod post
373051,yes pardon ser come great people's republic korea contrary inferior western systems value onchain privacy highly
373052,generously offer asylum tornado cash developers
373056,ok flood spam point buy nft spam kingdom
373057,enough discussed shared circles r fun peace
373058,yes exactly lets wait see develops damn
373059,replacement dove metrics anything better exists
373060, mvp something i'm cooking

373071,jfc stfu dont know anything
373072,literally
373073,thanks insightful respectful answer answering news discord say literally apparently know anything subject shut mouth got 
373074,hi sers sure asked already way batch different contract calls one transaction without creating contract js library similar
373075,multicall
373076,
373077,also
373078,saved hours coding ser thanks
373079,least 3 different versions fyi
373080,rofl
373081,oxmikko van0k share
373082,guys websockets still gud
373083,intern anymore
373084,hi fellow lobsters hopefully guys ivan mind bit defi saver fyi quite lot crazy stuff days we're focused buidling launching arbitrum optimism month ago flagship automation service officially live leading l2 chains make us service lot smaller positions mainnet automate positions 500 minimum debt requirement keep positions safe liquidation 20x lower tx fees l2s arbitrum automation went live week here's announcement optimism automation live weeks cool thing there's ongoing liquidity mining campaign aave v3 probably know
373085,lobsterdao super pac
373086,cool product make money
373087,hi elie sustainable feebased business model wanted keep things simple introducing 025% service fee complex actions include token swap within transaction standard basic interactions available official protocol dashboards example aave maker liquity like addwithdrawborrowpayback take service fees advanced protocol interactions created like 1tx deleveraging boost repay creating closing leveraged positions 025% service fee swapped amount automated positions charge 03% automated adjustments that's basically
373089,cool driving good revenue far still early days
373090,u dont know defisaver idk 
373091,hmm well check joel john's analysis get picture better 
373092,
373093,dont lol guess anything outside nfts got little clue lol
373094,cool exactly looks like legit token terminal revenue feel like author gem uniswap revenue still 0 
373095,
373096,kid got soon back muh hacked selling
373097,
373098,nightmare fuel
373099,ur seed phrase stays whats point
373100,u go propagate tx somehow else
373102,point one consensys nuking ability use infura interact tcash contracts despite ability use another service
373103,long seed always find way around import ledger seed metamask
373104,ye also didnt get emilianobonassi
373105,existence alternatives completely immaterial point compliance
373106,well let's see metamask owned consensys consensys owns mycrypto know consensys they're company owns infura
373107,yes also change rpc url within metamask
373108,change rpc right
373109,hope need explain problem move another option coinbase wallet perhaps probably read first name think another wallet maybe trust wallet good news binance owns trust wallet
373110,rabby
373111,owned debank think
373112,ya think debank fancies fight bottom line worry
373113,saying metamask eventually able remove custom rpc feature
373114,im right
373115,initate transactions geth directly doesnt help hardware wallet though
373116,mean
373117,metamask proprietary software consensys whatever want
373118,technically u create wallet
373119,metamask like front uiux
373120,time launch coding bootcamp lol
373121,talking rpc banning certain interactions chain like infura tornado changing another rpc still allows transactions
373122,learn code
373123,run node
373124,soon cli wallets would option
373125,understand can't rewrite another contract
373126,would possible validators reject certain transactions would whole different problem lol
373127,many validators
373128,course hope many would prevent though
373129,thought metamask open source
373130,treasury saying illegal validate tx containing xxx would great start lol
373131,fun prospects future poseth coinbase kraken lido supermajority stake 
373132,im pretty sure backend validators available already used faster network transactions specifically nfts
373133,
373134,good read thanks 
373135,gonna dumb question service would prevent interacting non known contract address say prevent curve dns hack would apply rpc wallet level
373136,antoniomjuliano week important technology sanctioned today developer open source software arrested contents software line need take stand illegal attack freedom 
373137,wrong though dont see proposing anything
373138,really besides need publicly take stand today leaders entire crypto community say far
373139,kinda toothless considering he's already complying
373140,well who's itching insert martyr reference 20
373141,isnt dydx banning tornado also
373142,well tornado guys already involuntary martyrs support way possible
373143,thats part process find way legally work devs afraid go jail
373144,hope holding breath given space renowned ability move
373145,
373146,like need storm streets something wealthy benefactors enough cover ensuing legal battle
373147,
373148,rest us push decentralizing everything meantime
373149,incentive many people think affected dirty tornado cash
373150,way anything changes there's existential threat ethereum result else going old news time merge rolls around maybe get updates insert publication month poor devs couple chats
373151,guarantee devs remember anyway tornado ofc special snowflake every defi protocol literally cannot used money laundering sets poor precedent inevitable attempts generalized crackdown later
373152,oh i'm sure devs care somebody make care late lol certainly care better care 
373153,message simple compliance rewarded defiance tolerated time defi dead long live comfi hyperbole maybe hopefully
373154,
373155,would customer service actually give info
373156,matter incentive alignment killer thing end cartelizing space try criminalize prohibition fantastic example normally alcohol manufacturing fairly dull business outlaw suddenly every still protected dozen men automatic weapons
373157,think defi turn regulatory arbitrage wild west boring fintech backend
373159,k
373160,there's money made demand product service driving underground leads game cat mouse ultimately explodes mainstream point puts entire apparatus ruin hostiletakeover printing press good example certain books banned early printers found made money printing books money stronger incentive fear reprisals rich printers could pay protection jurisdictions outside central control
373161,quick question outrage happened happening constantly years like sort new idea feds arrest creators mixers
373162,privacy problem government getting wrong
373163,provide
373165,never tried arrest eg wasabi devs introducing coinjoin wallet
373166,i'm saying exactly unpredictable unprecedented outcome
373167,yeah there's precedence difference businesses operated people indifferent smart contracts
373168,metacoin right one banningarresting creators mixer still different arresting founder a16z backed startup one step banning actual operators mixers reason say there's suddenly open season defi devs
373169,that's good means there's time fight one nip hamfisted approach bud
373171,flaw analogy target market quite content comfi dare say vast majority market care less tornado event haz nuffin hide
373173,comfi feel comfy lobs case feeling compliancy going next narrative especially supported institutional types enter picture
373177,disagree europe totally fine books banned enough people involved counterculture reformation ended thing matter criticalmass ultimately appeal masses we're still early days pressure exert us likely increase significantly time
373178,narrative banks bad one seeped aggressively western culture past decade two painting defi fulcrum populist coalition antiestablishment right left wingers hard sell
373179,heh sort thinking even critical mass within crypto existed continually eroded every compliant vcfunded startup
373180,
373181,i'm sure comparing conditions europe days anywhere near thing i'd go far saying europe access books substantially problems worry time banks bad without good reason many people burned pretty hard previous recessions caused huge panic people forgotten bail outs banks got mistakes though something said messaging pushed started becoming concerning crypto xyz feel good thing believe message sent things like right privacy hand waived away messaging
373182,keeps losing got fucked btc tesla everything thought
373183,yes first use printing press print indulgences short time horizon culture around technology ultimately matter technological space fundamentally corrosive sorts power structures people currently seeking translate cefi
373184,say done done done funamentally undermines compliance relationships past threehundred years
373185,talking gutenberg printing press first use printing bible
373186,seems possible gutenberg printed indulgences early 1452 request nicolaus cusanus prominent german cardinal early connection printing bureaucratic needs church yes first use bible second working establishment times
373187,i'm addressing first use printing press print indulgences
373188,anyway want get topic kingdometc ramble topic well others related era day
373189,yes kingdom perfect please buy lobster come discuss
373190,ok ok i'm finally sold lobster special type
373191,buy lobster eth pow

373219,lets leave
373220,ok contrarian twitter
373223,hell ofacgeth joke
373224,flashbots pr disallow transactions fr ofac list
373225,considering 80% nodes running mevgeth close enough ofacgeth
373226,year ago would joke nottheonion
373227,oh wait think relayer pr
373228,geth
373229,like geth developers ef payroll residing west

373234,twitter space shared 
373235,would one moderated genuinely wondering
373236,altenative space developers tornado cash work technical ascept blocking 
373237,1 guys bit experience w privacy working 2 speakers outlined dont seem directly privacy related unless r good privacy hid gg disrepsect tried filter based available info would die countless spaces altho urs cool blz proceed keep 
373238,prepared threefold fork 1 ofaceth 2 ethw 3 nofaceth

373257,tomorrow everyone blink keep nothing happened
373258,comfi ftw
373259,dai basically 15% crypto collateralized stable
373260,assume etherscan soon start sending data direct contract calls point defi nfts become difficult average bayc bullish
373261,transaction sent whatever rpc youre connected wallet nothing etherscan
373262,could still block people viewing website tho
373263,yeah didnt mean theyd block transactions make common front ends unusable general public
373264,quite actually newcomers guni tokens liquidity pools connected usdc common liquidity pairs circle co quite lot power render dai useless instant counterintuitively let's say 10k usdc wallet probability particular wallet millions wallets frozen might perceived lesser probability freezing single collateral makerdao that's merely current state dai design limit change theory
373265,yeah see people start forking official uis strip blacklist open users like dydx
373266,aave 
373267,thats still path huge cleansing imo almost like torrents popularity never really became mainstream blocked average joes wont bother looking mirrors anyway really debating cause probably boring
373268,woah really hitting hard time night long pull requests innit
373269,probably taken hint introduced kyc cozying institutions onwards
373270,yes
373271,using trm labs
373272,curious activities
373273,probably touched tornado
373274,wonder vote went 
373275,dont know purse justin sun
373276,trm various risk profiles probably aave tweak bit set max risk blanket catch people 12 hops tornado seems like dydx
373277,youre saying everyone touched tornado currently blacklisted virtually major defi seems like stretch
373278,going
373279,even addies hops away banned dydx
373280,aave interesting webapp hosted ipfs decentralized think they'd concerned trm's list
373281,dydx adjusted risk profile fixed
373282,already chainalsis rating high risk
373283,yeah said mistake basically
373284,tornado ipfs
373285,anyway gotta tornado check ig
373286,using centralized risk assesment service
373287,
373288,tornado also specifically sanctioned addresses touched tornado preaction
373289,different risk profiles
373290,get token away governance
373291,theory practice compliance rewarded ready comply
373292,know understand trm wondering protocols actually already enforcing said
373293,i'm pretty certain giving personally identifiable information 3rdparties opposite solution problem let rephrase government scheme best trojan horse could ask even desirable big red button power fiatcoins provide
373294,seems got many different ones starting week
373295,aave proof github 
373296,yeah gotta see works practice ie anyones addresses actually blacklisted merely using tc
373297,trm token ought breaking aths lol
373298,matter really
373299,flip buitton change risk assesment ban every lobster holder
373301,encrypt 1 pii body provably irreversible work
373302,hard take question seriously
373303,totally true believe takes amazing community pull
373304,things i've learned space rich communities actually
373305,that's true think best community life changing
373306,especially consistently active ones
373307,exactly love
373308,adlunam consistent week twitter spaces every tuesday thursday
373309,think it'll great move partnering
373310,great partnerships always helpful
373311,always look forward
373312,bots 20
373313,remember people shilling better decentralized alternative infura 
373314,ooof
373315,think need support sort canceldao keep remembering cases false promises spread awareness web3 project limitations like one betray decentralization movement say
373316,nice
373317,understood advantage pokt infura ability work decentralized ie vitaliks phial galadriel 
373318,stay compliance pocket portal blocking interaction number addresses connection pni pocket portal means activity involving portal absolutely required compliance us regulations wasnt lie investors
373319,bad idea kills
373320,need ger rid centralized portal otherwise makes sense
373321,mind graph protocol exact centralized payment portal decentralized subgraph network
373322,claim still rnd v1 portal
373323,
373324,sec wishes effective lol
373325,metamask implement kyc verification unfortunately predictable 1year ago uniswap banned derivatives tokens
373326,wen oracles banned facilitate creation illegal derivatives platforms 
373327,uniswap v3 ban builtin twap oracle
373328,meh thats already onchain thinking usapi3 chainlink band others
373329,mean everything fked need light dark places lights go univ3 twap better nothing really uniswap still break somehow chainlink controlled multisig afaik
373330,mean randomly declared usage contract illegal yeah chainlink potentially forced multisig theyre going path oracle would safe always ban usage oracle smart contract kek kinda important gets fought well see random bans smart contracts facilitate illegal stuff
373331,uniswap invulnerable
373332,unfortunarely doesnt work way use smartcontract tell blockchain either censorship resistant entitiespeople censor usage blochcain primitives dexes oracles infra like rpc ipfs gateways etc
373333,mean theory chainlink simply made blacklist contracts something like tellor gets complicated anybody report prices permissionlessly enough tokens staked tbh simple ban would addresses eg supply price data derivatives exchanges get flagged probably effect tc ban people stop answering specific price requests looks bleak tbh
373334,btw um what's excuse going willingly compliant going asked go step comfi embrace add amlkyc can't pull can't card unless uniswap
373335,wish makerdao would open oracles would cost zero whole ecosystem would benefit isnt like dog manger situation
373336,solves nothing tho
373337,arent controller dao didnt dig details osm details since possible use
373338,many ways shut oracles tbh thats scary part save truly would uniswap 
373339,could elaborate way one shutdown makerdao oracle
373340,also seems company something oracles
373341,also fucked
373342,anything thats natively onchain would fucked 
373343,ban usage contracts la tc go data sources supply data force revoke access target individual dao members run oracle unit pretty public proposal
373344,thanks honesty
373345,1 data source never problem data providers find new one 2 target dao members understand doesnt matter settelment leyer network consensus smartcontract dao consensus cases mitigated using tortornada
373346,2 mean
373347,target individual dao members run oracle unit pretty public proposal imagine price oracles works dao members commit price result calcs stake consensus focal point reward etc concern bad actors come dao members commit prices compromise enough render oracle useless argue internet access via tor wallet owenershipfunding via tornado mitigate issue year ago thought page 9 wp long deprecated dont use shouldnt still true today
373348,although seems far simplier solution chainlink move multisig proper onchain dao
373349,well one dao members rune christensen handful american vcs a16z quite favorite think people entities itching use tornado sanction
373350,dao decides differently let think talking case community clearly doesnt want cencored external forces use limitation technology centralizations make
373351,community want whatever wants reality built effectively backdoor system reality takes precedence desires every project tripping moment phone trm labs contract dao updates still happening
373352,stated 
373353, reading lines expect metamask start actively flag addresses better worse bit worried consider fighting phishing first thing help privacy cypherpunkey
373354,unfortunately well implement kyc aml law every interaction users identification needed dont think defi exception regards
373355,use sourceify
373356,like etherscan except contracts stores ipfs maintained ef
373357,use layerzero generalized abstract messaging cross chain token needed
373358,postmerge possible penalize validators skip ofacsanctioned blocks
373359,
373360,directly believe
373362,suppose could penalized they're active canonical chain
373364,huh 
373365,
373366, sounds like project proactively block beyond legally required
373367,thanks fighting good fight godspeed 
373368,overcomply selfinvented sanctions see happens let ride see happens
373369,ctrlf sad discussed already fin
373370,reminder defisaver serbian based defiprotocol exist allow u manage big lending protocols app dont need ofac compliant
373371,
373372,increase sc risks reduce regulatory risks kinda
373373,chain dataset prices update every swap happens chain would immutable would human interaction go
373374,thats trillion dollars worth gas day want calculations updates onchain
373375,makes onchain oracles example expensive
373376,zero knowledge acceptable solution theres got way
373377,well ok lets make new tech come together usable solves human problems solution exist even close yet seems
373378,also zk make cheaper
373379,god chris blec right
373380,anyway feels like rhetoric mental masturbation convo defeats known variables pointing sky nah
373381,damn 
373382,someone recommend tools portfolio tracking across 100s wallets
373383,looking
373384,swear saw something like github olympus dev life can't find
373386,
373387,
373388,cheer old chaps defeat sorta stuff trivially need tests make sure doesnt loose money ya
373389, make sure doesnt loose money hah classic
373390,wallet connect impersonator made chrome extension
373391,impersonate wallet via walletconnect provide cover connecting wip via metamask
373392,tho cursory examination frontends implement trm way let alone provide status code enabled address oasis egregious dapp aave balanceruniswap going bantegs public shame list
373393,oasis makes sign message uses create identity wont work dapp easily aave rest fetch address connected web3 provider wallet
373394,luckily web3 standards virtually non existent wrt handing multiple wallet connections
373395,would interesting potentially data request inquiry trm californias ccpa hq state seeing exactly collect etc etc
373396,please
373397,aave seems aggressive one flagged one wallets rest use still wallet
373398, check uniswap
373399,exactly definition linked addresses tornado cash aave
373400,got dusted 3 days ago tc
373401,ahh 01 eth addresses
373402,yes
373403,can't believe actually worked
373404,
373405,metamask
373406,feels like strongly undermines narrative gho well selfsovereign unless aave decides block isnt particularly self sovereign 
373407,ahhhh takes dont wanna delete censor distinction interfaces regulated nature opensource smart contracts accessible ui please ctrlf convo 10 times past days
373408,yeah fair enough concerned impacts launch gho since ive pretty psyched completely agree practical perspective narrative marketing wise people wont understand nouance really hoping ecosystem would switch decentralized stable thought gho good shot
373410,already worries double post sers dont alarmed admins remove doubleposted messages issa crime hope
373415,
373418,nothing surprising really
373419,still surprises people simply suffer bullshit binance
373421,reminds tornado started blocking ofc addresses months ago 
373422,happens someone sends top 50 lps 01 aave uni bal would freeze funds ui
373423,ofc ui contract scant freeze ser
373425,aave protocol contracts capability like never
373426,points access like ui ipfs redirected appaavecom different story
373427,could introduced via upgrade via governance though presumably
373428,
373429,sure long shot stupid question guys aware websites like dove metrics acquired crunchbase crypto weekly etc get information regarding vc funding say they're hand picked assume they're getting information certain news sources cover crypto funding connections vcs run scripts said news source automatically add site employee review guess anyone else better one know answer
373430,probably something wrong sound rational block cases like dust transfers ofc really know first hand big access aave ui repo api
373431,could models yes issue end kind trustable point info ipfs deployment legit
373432,lmaoo guy gets hilarious passing day
373433,also contact startups confirm info enrich
373434,yea makes sense wonder original information comes
373439,upcomming zkrollups working generalised private transactions
373440,good try fed
373441,send 01 eth find
373442,rollup railgun building privacy infra uses zksnarks allow private txs way 0zk addresses onchain dark pools means arbitrary smart contract calls private balance without need rollups l2 etc 
373443,awesome
373444,thing types systems stop gaps imho privacy standard people dont care untill need opt revealing info would game
373445,privacy default wont win eth l1
373446,stopgaps point
373447,100% l2 thing
373448,thats end users end day
373449,hence original question scroll polygon working best knowledge
373450,
373451,wrote dumb shit hopefully dumb
373452,im allowed tell ivan ban
373454,please ctrlf stuff polygon zk stuff aztec etc
373455,yeah thats generalizable privacy share 
373456,since railgun sharing im gonna share secret shill explanation problem secure compute 
373458,3 part series start explains want friggin hard actually l2 even l1
373459,
373460,god fuck ass 7th time sent fine keep let stop
373461,hey guys found transfer usdc op chain via metamask looks nobody twitter mentioned anybody knows happened
373462,friend tried work either
373463,weird take correlate hiding traces political ideology would ever beneficial utopian antistatists imply obedience somehow requirement able purchase house 
373464,obviously hiding traces regulators mean dumb idea
373465,yes buy house u kinda need notary fiat smth realworld implies hiding things
373466,emmar accepts bitcoin
373468,thesis permissionless smartcontracts works ofacgeth
373469,ye noted end falls fucked
373470,one rare places get banking realworld assets always jurisdiction grows succumbs general rules
373471,already getting harder anyway russia example normal people normal workers
373472,yep whole tornado ofac fiasco incredibly bearish ethereum long termand competitors immune either would want store anything smart contract platforms could censored finger snap
373473,back banks unironically
373474,already defacto banks onchain right
373475,i'm curious everyone's course action personally i'm withdrawing half irl although hate
373476,true even feel less safe usdc bank acc tbh hope passing fud forget couple months
373477,easy say within realms comfy chair somewhat peaceful western nation everyone's reality unless want argue govs trusted times definition bit ivory tower take
373478,tbh im scared people forget months
373479,ah mean pov less comfy states well ye comment didnt apply mostly referring us regulators
373480,months optimistic 
373481,order one merge old news
373482,sad probably true
373483,wonder could built browser wallets could verify checksum frontend exact mirror appaavecom
373484,think suggestion something enough consequences market forget 2 weeks andor absurdity sanction plain even regulators see stands i'd say sanction even successful probably anticipated dapps used defy sec tripping comply excuse going give they're asked implement amlkyc need pretend can't uniswap pull pretty much every dapp updatable already dubious plausible deniability hurr durr dao can't anything almost certainly dead point like said devs willing go jail million sorry's make realities jail time easier lol sooo dev community something 
373485,dont need dev builder
373486,could onchain blacklist upgradable sc tho 
373487,thread scroll
373488,missed point follow close stunned actually mentioned scvalidatorsonchain sanctioning 
373489,can't even send eth sure button inactive
373490,metamask issue
373491,rollback metamask version
373492,ok thx use op enough justify lazy atm
373493,less tweets next time pls
373494,restart ur computer
373495,came across day using brave worked switched browsers firefox
373496,ye using brave may issue indeed
373497,metamask brave many silly bugs 005% desktop pc users use brave browser doubt consensys bothered fix soon
373498,try seedpkey rabby wallet work issue
373499,brave always oddities large proportion ui bugs reported us brave
373500,low users bugs bad combo getting stuff fixed promptly
373501,anyone using build brave wallet saw add custom rpcs aswel
373502,iirc absolute terms brave low number users terms crypto think brave reasonable share cohort
373503,plus quickest way get things fixed tweet ceo pretty much first line support kek
373504,impossible add custom rpc meta mask days
373505,
373506,i'm pretty active years never problems brave fwiw usually slow rpc infura downing problem
373507,tinfoil hatting ath
373508,add never connects
373509,brave firefox
373510,means broken endpoint usually
373512,
373513,use pocket network rpc service
373514,tool switch rpclistdotinfo similar chainlist baked decentrilized rpc service infura
373515,pocket better infura decentralizedcensorship resistant right
373516,think
373517,3 2 1
373518,please explain recent statement 
373520,yesi know
373521,everything us based get us huge market decentralized space ffs serve anywhere world staying anon
373522,yet still insisting decentralized censorship resistant
373523,portal one ways host team use pokt
373524,months use sdk visit pokt relay portal number limit 3000 dapp space new dapp
373525,dapp use sdk stake get relay
373526,criticize pokt think architecture designed fine imo
373527,well dev arrested netherlands
373528,us sanctions propagates throughout whole space
373529,little difficult explain dapp use portal service try make clear 1in v0 version pokt protocol free dapp still needs stking pokt generate endpoint team decide give subsidy demand side limit bcs free 2pokt early stage design decentrilized perfect better wen v1 version
373530,also dao decide protocol's feature future declaration core team include portal dont see propasal ban tornado protocol layer
373531,try bullish pokt try figure real situation happended means 
373532,
373533,new drama
373535,velodrome like
373540,wait send gifs
373542,yo hope etc get activity going thought process eth mining pools shitload capital locked equip assumign ethpow dumponpleb oneday story miners go etc start actively stimulating developmentcommunitybuildorsetc
373543,thoughts
373544,typical
373550,lol
373551,haha
373552,ivan ban soon
373556,supply could creat demand
373557,dont wanna get banned ivan continue ur shitpost ur
373568,hence incentive part
373569,sure miner pump hard
373570,link tweet
373571,find list banned addresses
373572,ofac ws
373573,dune analytics dashboard
373574,yes think etc would gain traction new ethpow eventually course action would probably shift mining power new pow dump tokens move back etc grayscale fund etc antpool investing 10m etc
373578,freezeroblocks
373579,anyone got links regarding onchain evidence gaba atm
373580,
373581,guess seen threads
373583,
373585,
373586,im also umm researching first thoughts work needed adapt contracts higher gas fees compared eth alternatives eth pretty far ahead tech wise
373587,looks like akula's chainspec format except akula guess
373588,wonder end drama tho maybe even etc people discuss unironically easy censoring pos transactions 
373589,wrong context
373590,exactly nick says actually easier censor transactions gabriel initially thought
373591,issue anyway
373592,hi
373593,bribe
373594,oh
373595,ivan
373596,gabriel understands easy hes talking something else
373597,point easy censor transactions pos doomed
373598,easy pow thing lexnode concerned impossibility plausible deniability attest blocks incur inactivity leak
373599,governments could blanket ban tx compliant chain starting block x
373600,realised publishing every version app ipfs that's super nice transparent user hope protocols future 
373601,like building upon chain includes sanctioned tx violating sanctions
373604,
373605,whats shown tweet dev thinks means anything
373606,seems like unknown account larping engagement
373607,wuuuuut
373608,would need court orderinjunction
373609,still modicum due process left
373610,feel ya
373611,think would way around pass law delegated regulation even start investigation arrest warrant jail indefinite amount time
373612,lets see
373613,yes time intifada 30
373614,vote republican choice
373615,lets real democrats ones pushing
373616,well i'm happy living country that's receiving side sanctions 
373618,they're nwo party whole american deep state swamp complicit republican party lacks balls
373619,dont need balls need puppets fed superpac money
373620,hopefully long since pax americana decline
373621,last thing want politician ideas
373622,anyway little pet project mine shows much promise
373623,expect financing enemy via interest payments
373625,hey top sorry resources recommend deepshit web2 vs web3 throughts competent indivuduals
373626,like really deep shit proper 3d chess reading material
373627,still dont wanna say
373628,surprised one person twitter made partial guess
373629,apply erigon akula innovations best class privacy blockchain
373630,think iron fish good theory layer2 privacy project
373631,layer 2 bullshit i'm talking l1
373632,evm obviously
373633,think tornado kind layer2
373634,drug dealers use tornado
373635,drug dealers go straight cex cashout
373636,anyway 
373637,obvs choice link stuff like vitalik's blog maybe balaji
373638,ones already studied sir smth exotic mb
373639,ringct initial screenshot made answer pretty obvious lol 
373640,mean anything many people around 
373641,anyone building selfhosted frontend appstore dapps blockscout explorer yet
373642,
373643,would interested something like
373644,confirmed use hsbc
373645,using funds lev trading stopped blew 50k
373646,sigh
373649,bulletproofs hint
373655,flashback
373656,muh mimblewimble
373657,historic moment lobster dao abandoning ethereum monero
373658,monero guy
373664,grin already rust node
373665,dead 
373666,entirely fair like ltc uses mw shielded addresses
373667,see lot ppl twitter condemning overreaction protocols think kinda naive think due individual decisions unrelated probably behind curtains situation everyone explicitly directed knew going happen days weeks damage control definitely prepared
373668,half modifications already well progress
373669,half already event happened observable novel nature
373672,nobody every scammer space 
373673,
373674,devs caught crosswinds that's shame handful highprofile projects complicit creating problem name growth deserve derision get
373675,really really hate never money lost excuse
373676,clear 15 mins billionaires made choices already much lose money investors unlikely anybody cares defi community ethics anymore
373677,kinda naive think people started big
373678,yeah weird story kinda similar came pretty late background money im sure case people lol
373679,list things learned bad choices never time give advice ended decided scam fuck
373680,class 2017 reading like
373681,pretty sure losing everything rite passage point lol
373682,notes 
373684,
373685,guy admitting guilt online theft fraud via feelings manifesto giving advice seeking legal instead lol
373689,broke etherscan
373690,try checking otterscan well

373701,insert text sent messages database groups hour
373702,spambot
373703,
373704,another day another stablecoin
373705,oh lawd
373706,happened acala
373709,tornadocash follows account thats probably reason also shared thematic stuff got 5 confirmations people shared thematic stuff tornado tagged shadowban well short feds crawling twitter tags follows massive bans without investigation
373711,old news point 
373712,happened
373713,
373714,holy shit drain lot
373715,actually seems isnt selling
373716,still 03
373717,there's way get funds right
373718,stopped operations able
373720,create new account
373721,
373722,shadowban well dont know lol ive put much time efforts sad
373723,least bring
373724,similar bug found last year stopped chain via referendum recovered funds wonder thats approach theyll take time
373725,hope though hour official updates worrisome
373726,pretty sure he'll white hat worst case scenario he's getting funds
373727,precedent
373728,
373729,sad news though yes please dont agitate people retweet personal posts looks spammy nobody hunting people making tweets hope u lefteris others shadowban soon 
373730,wait think confusing banteg lol providing context tcashrelated shadowbanning
373731,removed messages usual fine 
373732,nono replying farm42 
373733,usual overselfpromo general rule
373734, self promo ok 
373737,initially smart contracts developed languges like javascript someone point pros cons developing smart contract javascript
373738,developer want know whether advantage established blockchain smart contracts written solidity
373739,know solidity like js talk words
373740,please google first even quora gives ok replies topic 
373741,js needs special runtimes like v8 harder make deterministic one fault plus quite slow due type system chains smart contracts assemblyscript similar typescript compile wasm
373742,can't use greedy functions standard languages case gas cost huge
373743,thanks writing smart contract directly using javascript still secure cost efficient writing solidity
373744,write closetodirect python compiler called vyper
373745,ah ok thanks
373747,write javascript near compiles wasm dotsama probably support point considering theyre wasm
373749,good take thread brantley addressed noobs like 
373750,cant wait 
373751,wtf lol
373753,almost like actually create web3 social platform time
373754,yes ui gets published transparently github actions course creating frontend without centralization point trivial task reality moment stack allowing complete decentralization get better still
373755,personal opinion people still bit understanding challenges even trying achieve full decentralization course mistakes things improve lot teams trying push thar direction right thing
373756,systems like decentralized governance huge endeavour especially nontechnical side
373758, chainlinkgod 0xfoobar banteg sassal zachxbt misttrack shadowban
373759,good crypto securitythemed ct shadow ban insane
373761,begone ct missed
373762,mastodonsocial
373763,looks like ausd starting repeg pretty impressive manage get back quickly
373764,
373765,vcs must u fund open source clones narcware
373766,lens protocol
373767,meant reply one
373768,lensterxyz 
373769,acala usd depegged 1billion exploit confirmed anywhere would biggest exploit year 
373770,ya 
373771,overly centralized discord ct getting hit utopian dream mine come true
373772,inevitable anyway gets us mass adoption anyway
373773,halted chain think funds frozen official comms yet may fine
373774,funds bridged 
373777,probably people complain blocks everyone besides ceo whos wallet wad funded tornado cash
373781,dotsama uses sovereign token concept besides chain halted time ways bridge would probably alerting systems place collateral factor id imagine would known happened
373782,huh
373783,want create narcware adware plenty positions web2 companies already
373784,anyone say r blocked
373785,twitter looking find message share screenshot yall cant find xx
373786,fuck weird pleb pitchforking everyone likes privacy company dealing risks others american might go paranoid overblock personal ens via tornado turned bueno increase risk score dusted tornado accounts mistake also get interface blocked interface whats surprising
373787,usamaro anyone per se
373788,fucking chill stop spam
373789,spam kingdom discuss virtue nothing wrong yesterday hot topic need ramble weeks
373791,ivan go touch grass
373792,future commerce web3 based really think tracking especially open data 
373793,scammers money launderers existed web3 well guess tornado team go focus paper cash instead writing code think piece code isnt going written call narcware telegram group dont think understand space incentives play
373794,anyone know good site bulk airdropping nfts many addresses nfts already exist
373795,one came 
373796, guess tornado team go focus paper cash yo wtf
373797,disperseapp multisenderapp
373800,disperse doesnt seem work multisender nft option realised mad annoying like anyway thanks case
373801,sounds like he's hyperbolic sambacha reverse saying people want write code respects regulation go back web2 ridiculous tornado cash focusing fiat
373802,far tell interface much nicer convenient service
373803,ivan pls brain smooth already cant take much
373804,cointoolapp maybe dyor
373805,lets hug chill try reasonably legally stand grand support stay safu lets go touch grass dont mean bushwhack log sers 3
373806,check contracts used multisending
373808,
373809,touch grass tho memezes
373810,resource read possible replay attacks hardfork cant seem find chat
373811,boys whats opinion amount staked network total amount staked participants increase decrease price volume affect amount staked opinion 
373812,incentives play magical nuanced concept obviously making money vcs funding virtuesignal decentralization one hand fund know there's money made anyone successfully leashes crypto dude telegram group calling we'd better alas norm pretend there's nuance understood act surprised time pay piper
373813,also looking good one
373814,looking dramas like rly deserve every scam hack regulation get crypto sending stuff back simple manners matter discussion rly especially lengthy personally offensive sides edit sending stuff back rightful owner 
373818,would send tokens burn address without back forth lol wtf dog snoop anyways
373819,
373820,sad 
373823,damn posted roadmap update days ago
373824,well practically without tornado without pow mining defi kycd
373825,ethxmr atomic swaps cash transactions 001%
373826,think disbanding official team continuing anon timing seems really odd
373827,said announcement complete funding round
373828,yeah details check link specifically 
373829,what's vxtwitter btw
373830, baserow smartsheet coda zenkit monday zoho creator rows directus grsit dbeaver anyone used databases one would recommend
373831,way link twitter without worrying previews telegram stroke twxttercom vxtwittercom shows text addition imagesvideos tweet
373832,none use databases elaborate little intend store like project management stuff that's 
373833,sorry simple clean ui display clean data like airtable example sure send images here's link 
373834,monday might closest airtable trello baserow
373835,regarding data project management i'm looking databases
373836,use dbeaver regularly w psql behind tho
373837,term ur looking cms
373838,data databases really supposed exposed frontend like
373839,content management platforms
373840,yea shit job describing looking would guys recommend content management platforms preferably free
373841,posterboard inkjet printer string
373842,great
373843,sorry trying flame really use case database traditional sense platforms wrappers top database allow interact data present
373844,pay
373845,still costs host database
373846,flaming guys showing proper terminology fine saw say databases airtable went
373847,yea think i'll probably end using notiongoogle sheets switch airtable
373848,yea gotcha mean really depends trying store want use features need pay fee
373849,probably paranoia actually feds sliding folks dms saying u
373850,depending many records trying work notion kind crap pretty bad performance hundred rows google sheets probably much better start
373851,also notion kind relying 3rd parties like zapieretc automated things
373852,essentially i'm trying create data vc funding rounds also create profiles vc project
373853,i'm going manual first eventually write script automate updates manual review publishing
373854,seems like need crm
373855,define bad address ones backed identity define set bad acitivities
373856,problem making separate profiles fund project google sheets would shit notion bad
373857,erp whatever call
373858,i'm sure exact terminology that's problem haha know need able build clean chart preferably colours categories create profiles
373859, look pictures website looks pretty ideal tbh also grist labs problem scaling it'll cost realized self host wont
373860,case working many records notion clunky handle basics scaling going cost things though go managed service
373861,since baserow option selfhosting
373862,would also look nocodb airtablelike experience polished uiwise seemed good featurewise
373863,noticed haha probably going go options first well wanted see people use familiar
373868,context tweet whatever trm says bad ie tornado users
373869,i'm looking see define really talk tornado cash continue define bad addresses bad activities case case prob sets dangerous precedent controlled idk clearheaded us government matters whether continue future i'd much comfortable regulators clearly defining bad means least providing set principles people play games like tradfi
373870,clearly defining heh underestimate value ambiguity
373871,i'm i'm pointing terribly could go people stay top especially influence ambiguity plays basically implicitly asking what's done
373872,terribly could go people stay top that's point fear wonderful tool
373873,things left vague open ended reason even things defined we've already seen last weeks sec happy reach anything determine fit definition
373874,operating assumption government currently well orchestrated entity everything clear cut following rules means okay sadly mistaken
373875,good fin
373876,yes vcs make money also fund innovation market decides need product seems clear products like need therefore valuable humanity dont market people willing pay vc doesnt make money real issue web3 shitty tokens weve funding community years clearly dont need
373877,ah yes enlightened vcs startups seen light know true innovation fintech knockoffs
373878,innovative web3 web2 completely dubious blockchain component that's okay humanity someone wants talk knowing space
373879,easy speak innovation innovate anything space 
373880,truly fin
373908,think completely midunderstanding points know i'm exactly consensus group maybe point get across i'll try make explicit attach citations needed 2 things 1 regulators remain vague projects putting pretty risky position ability influence they'll good intelligence direction they'll go either influence short end stick go know going avoid deduceable critical thinking citations needed dont buy logic ask someone works works sro managing regulatory relations see corroborate 2 definitions principles good places iterate side note originate regulators need adopted regulators plenty channels industry influence iterative process ie sro appeal ogc 1 like something regulators file lawsuit 23 also may choose flock towards rival regulators la lummisgillibrand bill chamber digital commerce cftc chamber digital commerce membership btw 4 1 1st paragraph assists preparing commission opinions 2 3 4 
373909,vcs fund projects one hand fund kyc startups another one massively diluting value proposition shitty advice give shit decentralization never look vcpoisoned projects say look actions excess profits double dipping equity dumping retail go bribe regulators become new incumbents regulatory moat building behind closed doors would never allow hobbyist dev participate exact play unfolded many times gambling social media example
373910,i'm really concerned amazing innovations defi world see light day sro employee really passionate defi
373911,brains r rotting hard despite words making sense really much appreciate
373912,actually think interesting topic appreciate takes even disagree might time hand unbiased mutes recommend
373913,following might fair going anywhere right chats lobbying important privacy important shitty idea things open chat nonlawyers doesnt work flood law isnt something know bit way semiassed surgeon gonna shit job whats best way pick hope guess consensus smart teams good lawyers get together privately push right agenda worms agenda full respect good luck sharing lex gab3 jake blockchainassn coincenter marc dydx experineced counsel opinions fine debating lets cast spell l e g l b e g n e
373916,pinning 12 hours
373917,permament rule ghosting important issues everyone share good materials garbage convos stop
373922,anyone know cosmos delegation service opposed using cli
373926,want delegate start validator
373927,want better understand online delegationasaservice system could work already one available
373928,going build one easier there's code look ahead time
373929,hm check i'm assuming that's looking i'm sure already know keplr wallet cosmostation
373930,entirely possible wallet code could answer question still early cosmos journey thanks link names
373932,yep citadel code part looking awesome love group
373933,looks like acala hack even intentional
373937,
373938,
373939,hey guys im genuinely looking discussion around critical issues see arise recent news
373940,plausible deniability likely man realized cash would lose original funds came story critical part several times
373941,
373944,anyone know library api detect tokens wallet
373945,moralis
373947,look like docs
373948,look bitquery ethplorer
373950,notion king
373952,management data anal true
373954,scan wallet address possible networks
373955,company question dynamicxyz theres retail token theyre auth0 web3 vcs human beings funded large part happens space good bad vcs youre fundraising pick good ones arent dump tbh youre token anyway probably dont care
373956,reference feels like convo may derailed point
373957,issue vcs incentivized care philosophical aspects investment along fact rich they're often ones skin game
373958,combination imo always treated extra caution even vc rather nice
373960,
373961,data analysis incorrect
373962,dont ofac filtering block construction
373963,
373964,proposal following temp check consensus check distributing funds uniswap governance rather token holders can't tell code
373965,consensus check parameters written gov forum
373966,
373968,etherscan api erc20 erc721 pro endpoint 
373969,
373970,much audit one top firms typically run
373971,chulie0 way 75k 300k
373972,thankyou 
373974,like 400k 500k know bean paid 350k even incomplete 
373975,depending source code size number quoted literally tob maybe peak time
373976,yeah def norm
373977,went w consensys sigma prime chainsecurity 300k gearbox code base far small large enough
373978,matthias egli chainsecurity
373979,depends line code number auditors ie engineer time approx 2050line code rough benchmark
373980,great ser well absolutely
373981,perhaps within last 3 months 
373982,perhaps giving literal quotes knowing others pay need speculate 
373983,maybe need like audit transparency google sheet like one compensation transparency floating would lines code cost time etc
373984,shouldnt hard make would example things always fluid say something definite cc matthiasegli ddoz9
373985,
373986,sure mean i'm referring yes literally referring tob topend
373987,yeh could doesnt specific would like temperature check think calchulus something similar would appreciate shared link good sir
373988,oo
373989,yeah think need find old link
373990,actually would like shill defisafety
373991,
373992,use quite bit guys reference impossible's
373993, impossible 94% coverage defisafety's framework
373994,still things improve 
373995, love teams work scope lot wider looks entire operational security practices dapp protocol think need things auditor specific
373996,insurance still works personally never used end day cause never made sense really done
373997,telegram premium gud
373998,bribed dont know actually lobster premium nft surely better
374000,think
374001,thx
374002,trail bits priced anyways shouldnt supported long crypto community supported sort companies also receive government contracts like shit web3 still charging ridiculous prices trail bits record phoning anyway lest forget hegic audit
374004,dapporg would 0
374007,unslashed issue spartan bucket willingness capital suppliers take risk right buckets might risk appetite including ones put together projects
374008,check spearbit yacademy reason high pricing booking advance 23 months
374009,overall market seems bit riskoff right tvls going accross board
374010,well fluid sense lines code parameter used estimate effort needed produce meaningful audit report loc really basic rule thumb usually defi projects much complex nft projects necessarily reflected number lines
374011,one can't get binance
374014,
374015,worst opsec advice ever dont
374016,get rugged family ser
374017,even family rugging nontech people fucking losing keys
374018,get 5 people know setup could quite good imo
374019,imagine getting anything signed
374020,55 ms 25 35
374021,25 insta rug lets honest
374022,reasonably hot wallet thats still massive pain butt
374023,might good idea give family members encrypted copies priv key cant access
374024,people know can't collude
374025,losing access rather getting hacked tbf
374026,
374027,bro know 5 people dont know yet would trust hold entire wealth
374028,literally people could trust parents grandparents even always
374029,theory easier practice yes
374030,people really need know come agreement redistribute money worst case lose money
374031,thats pretty bad case lmao
374032,yes depends many funds got would trust parents grandparents ehm tech savvy
374033,can't collude know
374034,need way communicate though need know physically get stuff done
374035,giving encrypted priv keys best worlds imho could set self multi sig idk phone ledger threshold signers distribute 3 encrypted copies multisig parties
374036,shag ledger ground back house mean 2 houses 2 backyards course
374037,communicate 4 communicate
374038,jurisdictions guys think accomodating regulatory frameworks crypto companiestoken issuers currently
374039,first thing approve exposes signing parties worse even open even worse idea already know way money line enough hit jackpot made desperate enough person signer matter time contact made thanks government friends know privacy criminals relevant data public
374040,exposes signing addresses parties actually various communication options days yeah collusion can't prevented right
374041,anyone explanation many hacks happen bear market rationale behind simply coincidence
374042,always many hacks happening suggesting experiencing bull market
374043,i'm afraid yes look rate hack stories making headlines bear say happening every week daily
374044,supergainz farm haxxor bored go offensive
374045,without actual data hard discuss feel like experiencing hacks maybe stand since less stuff going general certainly less rugs make dependent headlines
374047,there's data tldr less hax compared last year damage done averaging 26 milhack 2022 explains headlines uwu

374077,well currently initiative post would ok far seems like people chat privately fin
374079,know kind general question useful research done stable coins besides scam backing market cap market dominance sorry admins allowed
374080,stablecoinswtf interesting information topic also defillama's stablecoin dashboards sure helps question thought would provide case helpful 
374083,thanks i'll check found piece i'm also reading right thought would share anyone else interested
374084,also find searching stablecoins digital currencies peg value external reference typically us dollar usd stablecoins play key role digital markets growth could spur innovations broader economy want open pdf

374139, tc validators big entities us pbs discussion still early days mev boost potential attack surface
374140,mevboost already implemented clients tho
374141,
374142,concerning since flashbots demonstrated today disregard existance countries us examples 
374144,teku prysm lighthouse
374145,implemented clients work mev boost obviously dont require
374146,correct support pulling blocks validate mev boost api
374147,dont feel confident censorship resistance
374150,
374152,hey frens tool put eth addresses want people sign wallets want join looks like collablend nfts seen put eth address whitelist
374153,hey anyone know much gas uniswap lib sqrt function consumes vs checked multiplication
374154,yes guildxyz functionality example allow list lens protocol 
374155,much
374156,citizen jack wrote tests 
374157,4000 vs 200 case anyones wondering
374158,one 4k
374159,sqrt
374160,makes sense expensive didnt realize much damn
374161,surprising i'd thought oddities trying squeeze optimizations possible
374162,
374163,delay uploading image ipfs
374164,mean much uploaded pinned findable may take search find right node youre getting cache misses
374165,additional delays may exist youre using 3rd party pinning service
374166,used infura uploaded cant find
374167,barely hello world prolly fuked somewhere
374169,try arweave
374170,pumping bags ipfs great critical infrastructure great
374171,least mirrored ipfsarweave optimal
374183,lobs coding question way dynamically import storage layout contract delegatecall possible exists execution main reason use one contract proxy two contracts
374195,
374204,infura last week killed public gateway pinning key etc
374205,freealex public group 
374206,fyi relay glorified service proxy providing gateway wallets use rpc service checks ensure originator infact wallet user agent still communicate actual relay mainnet one closed source currently
374207,say ensure always fake obviously ymmv checks known wallet extension identifiers iirc
374208,infact mev boost sidecar fails produce block recommendation actually fallback block construction process event
374209,correct think teams also working parallel construction ie prepare vanilla block case
374210,whats missing ideal would making easy compare vanilla block block received relay client side
374211,even define acceptable level censorship tx level
374212,ie block doesnt contain censored txs isnt full vanilla block may higher value
374213,isnt currently feasible iirc mevboosr talks cl el
374214,real design flaw sidecar approach vs middleware approach mev boost basically like step father responsibility none authority
374215,cucked day 0
374216,bc beacon node api freeze preventing necessary changes forget 
374217,anyone make instruction set non tech elites still use tornado cash alternative frontends explanation tornado plus thing list rpc endpoints relayers still rekt etc
374218, outlined thoughts fee switch
374219,understanding correctly wants force hard fork get alleged bitcorns back
374220,company tulip trading ltd seeking bring proceedings high court would require 16 bitcoin developers based around world write software patches enable recovery assets worth 1bn stolen 2020 hack wright's computers
374221,i'm gonna go limb say wright 1b assets ever hack
374223,point simply dont think ready much reasoning resistant happening rn eg blind proposals encrypted txs etc lets see
374224,statement centralized staking entities would censor protocol level prefer exit validators came
374225,want say 
374226,repercussions saying one thing another push comes shove feign victim et voila
374227,1 stand freedom together freealex opensourceisnotacrime want help please join us
374228,want answer b sure say one held accountable community users saying anything though still saying something that's
374229, says b push comes shove niche group community u lie response let's nuanced discussion rest community expect comply reasons attack much insert excuses
374230,see jeremy whatshisname played usdc
374231,know alluding thick 
374232,still would like least statement silence also statement
374233,yeah it'd nice admitted right gate know dealing
374234,silence really statement either generally supposed avoid making claims future unless actually intend deliver
374235,that's getting legal discussion kingdom etc
374236, silence really statement either clear getting legalese guys make statements every day commited 'insert big words here' ec
374237,fwiw disagree trying coax answer makes good reference eventually happens
374238,we're committed xyz drastically different saying x happens plan especially lot unknowns things air say something deliver get trouble either way
374239,people genuinely know bigger entities kind boat regard everyone else waiting see everyone else point
374240,3730 ethereum get captured state
374242,
374243,know quite doxxed jurisdiction point government asks use specific staking client comply simply exit validator know size size field devolves permissioned centralized stoppable finance failed size matter
374244,doesnt actually think though
374245,entities accept censor end censored network
374246,come isidoros ofc know
374247,know well
374248,would exit field devolved
374249,help anyone
374250,sounds even worse making ethereum depend proprietary piece infra
374251,necessary piece mev boost
374252,alternative rpc like infura
374253,anyone know tool website see addresses delegated voting power another know sites like tally allow see many addresses trying get actual wallet addresses
374254,mind well lot type there's much else say
374255,sorry topic there's never good time figured best place ask
374256,scaring although feel like snapshot would kind record
374257,helps longer dedicating precious resource time something longer believe may also help others realize something finished waste precious resource mind saying heading straight

374410,trying wrap head around lens protocol ens competitor centralized indexer listens event using lens handle provides api build app top
374411,decentralised twitter dont think trying compete ens handle
374412,data stored arweave
374413,decentralized signon profile kind thing create lens handle use apps compatible lens protocol mostly social kind apps think probably havent looked much decentralized twitter one app building think also first launched core team
374414,everytime someone explains lens decentralised twitter makes ppl confused think u directly everyone says data stored arweave means nothing
374415,im curious aave plans integrating future social credit score undercol lending etc rn seems like low level protocol social graphing hopes dev community building user facing utility correct im wrong
374416,yeah kinda sidestepped solving actual problems decentralized social stuff providing base layer letting others build actual products feel like apps really taking yet
374417,think designing protocol community build overlaying products bad strategy btw way go imo
374418,given good incentives contributing devs deed think lacking rn
374419,essentially bit like early web attempts creating distributed social graph data supposed embedded page rss like protocol help keep tabs friends
374420,yeah decentralized canonical social graph eg entity across fbtwittermyspaceytsoundcloud build top something like lens pls correct im wrong
374422,people sad smiley means eth live long block people better cefi need users switch central point failures faster better looking users
374423,pek ec eae ooac
